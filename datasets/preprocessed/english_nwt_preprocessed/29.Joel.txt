4  what was left by the devouring locust the swarming locust has eatenand what was left by the swarming locust the unwinged locust has eatenand what the unwinged locust has left the voracious locust has eaten
5  wake up you drunkards and weep wail all you wine drinkersbecause the sweet wine has been taken from your mouths
6  for a nation has come up into my land mighty and without number
its teeth are the teeth of a lion and its jaws are those of a lion
7  it has devastated my vine and turned my fig tree into a stumpstripping them completely bare and tossing them asideleaving their twigs white
8  wail as a virgin wearing sackcloth doesfor the bridegroom of her youth
9  grain offering and drink offering have ceased from the house of jehovahthe priests the ministers of jehovah are in mourning
10  the field has been devastated the ground mournsfor the grain has been devastated the new wine has dried up the oil has failed
11  farmers are dismayed vinedressers wailbecause of the wheat and the barleyfor the harvest of the field has perished
12  the vine has dried upthe fig tree has withered
the pomegranate the palm and the appleall the trees of the field have dried upfor joy has turned to shame among the people
13  put on sackcloth and mourn you priestswail you ministers of the altar
come in and spend the night in sackcloth you ministers of my godfor grain offering and drink offering have been withheld from the house of your god
14  proclaim a fast call for a solemn assembly
gather the elders together with all the inhabitants of the landto the house of jehovah your god and cry to jehovah for help
15  woe because of the day for the day of jehovah is nearand it will come like a destruction from the almighty
16  has not food been taken from before our very eyesand rejoicing and joy from the house of our god
17  the seeds have shriveled under their shovels
storehouses are desolate
granaries have been torn down for the grain has dried up
18  even the livestock groan the herds of cattle wander in confusion for they have no pasture and the flocks of sheep bear the punishment
19  to you o jehovah i will callfor fire has devoured the pastures of the wildernessand a flame has consumed all the trees of the field
20  even the wild beasts long for youbecause the streams of water have dried upand fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness
2  blow a horn in zion shout a war cry in my holy mountain
let all the inhabitants of the land tremblefor the day of jehovah is coming it is near
2  it is a day of darkness and glooma day of clouds and thick gloomlike light of dawn spreading out on the mountains
there is a people numerous and mightynever before has there been one like itand never again will there be anotherthrough the years of all generations
3  ahead of it a fire devoursand behind it a flame consumes
the land ahead of it is like the garden of eʹdenbut behind it is a desolate wildernessand nothing can escape
4  its appearance is like the appearance of horsesand they run like warhorses
5  the sound is like that of chariots as they leap on the mountaintopslike the crackling of a blazing fire that consumes stubble
it is like a mighty people drawn up in battle formation
6  because of them peoples will be in anguish
every face will grow flushed
7  they charge like warriorsthey scale a wall like soldierseach keeps to his own courseand they do not swerve from their paths
8  they do not shove one anothereach man advances in his course
if the weapons cause some to fallthe others do not break ranks
9  into the city they rush on the wall they run
onto the houses they climb through the windows they enter like a thief
10  before them the land trembles and the heavens rock
sun and moon have become darkand the stars have lost their brightness
11  jehovah will raise his voice before his army for his camp is very numerous
for the one carrying out his word is mightyfor the day of jehovah is great and very aweinspiring
who can endure it
12  yet even now declares jehovah return to me with all your heartswith fasting and weeping and wailing
13  rip apart your hearts and not your garmentsand return to jehovah your godfor he is compassionate and merciful slow to anger and abundant in loyal loveand he will reconsider the calamity
14  who knows whether he will turn back and reconsiderand leave behind a blessinga grain offering and a drink offering for jehovah your god
15  blow a horn in zion proclaim a fast call for a solemn assembly
16  gather the people sanctify the congregation
collect the old men gather the children and nursing infants
let the bridegroom go out from his inner chamber and the bride from her bridal chamber
17  between the porch and the altarlet the priests the ministers of jehovah weep and say do feel pity o jehovah for your peopledo not make your inheritance an object of scornletting the nations rule over them
why should the peoples say where is their god
18  then jehovah will be zealous for his landand show compassion on his people
19  jehovah will answer his people here i am sending to you grain and new wine and oiland you will be fully satisfiedi will no longer make you a reproach among the nations
20  i will drive the northerner far away from youi will disperse him to a dry and desolate wastelandwith his vanguard toward the eastern seaand his rear guard toward the western sea
the foul smell from him will ascendthe stench from him will keep ascendingfor he will do great things
21  do not be afraid o land
be joyful and rejoice for jehovah will do great things
22  do not be afraid you beasts of the fieldfor the pastures of the wilderness will become greenand the trees will bear fruitthe fig tree and the vine must give their full yield
23  you sons of zion be joyful and rejoice in jehovah your godfor he will give you the autumn rain in the right amountand he will send upon you a downpourthe autumn rain and the spring rain as before
24  the threshing floors will be full of pure grainand the presses will overflow with new wine and oil
25  and i will make compensation to you for the yearsthat the swarming locust the unwinged locust the voracious locust and the devouring locust have eatenmy great army that i sent among you

29  and even on my male slaves and female slavesi will pour out my spirit in those days
30  and i will give wonders in the heavens and on the earthblood and fire and columns of smoke
31  the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into bloodbefore the coming of the great and aweinspiring day of jehovah
32  and everyone who calls on the name of jehovah will be savedfor on mount zion and in jerusalem there will be those who escape just as jehovah has saidthe survivors whom jehovah calls
3  for look in those days and in that timewhen i bring back the captives of judah and jerusalem
2  i will also gather together all the nationsand bring them down to the valley of jehoshʹaphat
i will enter into judgment with them therein behalf of my people and my inheritance israelfor they scattered them among the nationsand they divided up my land among themselves
3  for my people they cast lotsthey would trade a boy to hire a prostituteand sell a girl for wine to drink
4  also what do you have against meo tyre and siʹdon and all the regions of philisʹtia are you repaying me for something if you are repaying mei will swiftly speedily bring your repayment on your heads
5  because you have taken my silver and goldand you have brought my finest treasures into your temples
6  and the people of judah and jerusalem you have sold to the greeksin order to remove them far from their territory
7  here i am rousing them to come from the place where you sold themand i will bring your repayment on your heads
8  i will sell your sons and daughters into the hand of the people of judahand they will sell them to the men of sheʹba to a nation far awayfor jehovah himself has spoken it
9  proclaim this among the nations prepare for war stir up the mighty men let all the soldiers draw near let them advance
10  beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning shears into spears
let the weak one say i am powerful
11  come and help all you surrounding nations assemble together to that place o jehovah bring down your powerful ones
12  let the nations be roused and come up to the valley of jehoshʹaphatfor there i will sit in order to judge all the surrounding nations
13  thrust in a sickle for the harvest is ripe
come down and tread for the winepress is full
the vats overflow for their badness is abundant
14  crowds crowds are in the valley of the decisionfor the day of jehovah is near in the valley of the decision
15  sun and moon will become darkand the stars will lose their brightness
16  and jehovah will roar out of zionout of jerusalem he will raise his voice
and heaven and earth will rockbut jehovah will be a refuge for his peoplea fortress for the people of israel
17  and you will have to know that i am jehovah your god residing in zion my holy mountain
jerusalem will become a holy placeand strangers will pass through her no more
18  in that day the mountains will drip with sweet winethe hills will flow with milkand the streams of judah will all flow with water
out of the house of jehovah a spring will flowand it will irrigate the valley of the acacia trees
19  but egypt will become desolateand eʹdom will be a desolate wildernessbecause of the violence done to the people of judahin whose land they shed innocent blood
20  but judah will always be inhabitedand jerusalem to generation after generation
21  i will consider innocent their blood that i had not considered innocentand jehovah will reside in zion
