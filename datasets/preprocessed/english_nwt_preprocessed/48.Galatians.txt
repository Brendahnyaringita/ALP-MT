4  now i say that as long as the heir is a young child he is no different from a slave although he is the lord of all things
2  but he is under supervisors and stewards until the day set ahead of time by his father
3  likewise we too when we were children were enslaved by the elementary things of the world
4  but when the full limit of the time arrived god sent his son who was born of a woman and who was under law
5  that he might release by purchase those under law so that we might receive the adoption as sons
6  now because you are sons god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts and it cries out abba father
7  so you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son then you are also an heir through god
8  nevertheless when you did not know god you were enslaved to those who are not really gods
9  but now that you have come to know god or rather have come to be known by god how is it that you are turning back again to the weak and beggarly elementary things and want to slave for them over again
10  you are scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years
11  i fear for you that somehow i have wasted my efforts on you
12  brothers i beg you become as i am because i also used to be as you are
you did me no wrong
13  but you know that it was because of a physical illness that i had my first opportunity to declare the good news to you
14  and though my physical condition was a trial for you you did not treat me with contempt or disgust but you received me like an angel of god like christ jesus
15  where is that happiness you had for i bear you witness that if it had been possible you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me
16  so then have i become your enemy because i tell you the truth
17  they are zealous to win you over but not for a good purpose they want to alienate you from me so that you may be eager to follow them
18  however it is always fine for someone to seek zealously after you for a good purpose and not just when i am present with you
19  my little children for whom i am again experiencing birth pains until christ is formed in you
20  i wish i could be present with you just now and speak in a different way because i am perplexed over you
21  tell me you who want to be under law do you not hear the law
22  for example it is written that abraham had two sons one by the servant girl and one by the free woman
23  but the one by the servant girl was actually born through natural descent and the other by the free woman through a promise
24  these things may be taken as a symbolic drama for these women mean two covenants the one from mount siʹnai which bears children for slavery and which is haʹgar
25  now haʹgar means siʹnai a mountain in arabia and she corresponds with the jerusalem today for she is in slavery with her children
26  but the jerusalem above is free and she is our mother
27  for it is written be glad you barren woman who does not give birth break into joyful shouting you woman who does not have birth pains for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of her who has the husband
28  now you brothers are children of the promise the same as isaac was
29  but just as then the one born through natural descent began persecuting the one born through spirit so also now
30  nevertheless what does the scripture say drive out the servant girl and her son for the son of the servant girl will by no means be an heir with the son of the free woman
31  so brothers we are children not of a servant girl but of the free woman
6  brothers even if a man takes a false step before he is aware of it you who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness
but keep an eye on yourself for fear you too may be tempted
2  go on carrying the burdens of one another and in this way you will fulfill the law of the christ
3  for if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he is deceiving himself
4  but let each one examine his own actions and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone and not in comparison with the other person
5  for each one will carry his own load
6  moreover let anyone who is being taught the word share in all good things with the one who gives such teaching
7  do not be misled god is not one to be mocked
for whatever a person is sowing this he will also reap
8  because the one sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh but the one sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit
9  so let us not give up in doing what is fine for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out
10  so then as long as we have the opportunity let us work what is good toward all but especially toward those related to us in the faith
11  see with what large letters i have written you with my own hand
12  all those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are the ones who try to compel you to get circumcised doing so only to avoid being persecuted for the torture stake of the christ
13  for even those who are getting circumcised do not keep the law themselves but they want you to be circumcised so that they may have cause for boasting about your flesh
14  but may i never boast except in the torture stake of our lord jesus christ through whom the world has been put to death with regard to me and i with regard to the world
15  for neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision but a new creation is
16  as for all those who walk orderly by this rule of conduct peace and mercy be upon them yes upon the israel of god
17  from now on let no one make trouble for me for i am bearing on my body the brand marks of a slave of jesus
18  the undeserved kindness of our lord jesus christ be with the spirit you show brothers
amen
5  for such freedom christ set us free
therefore stand firm and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery
2  see i paul am telling you that if you become circumcised christ will be of no benefit to you
3  again i bear witness to every man who gets circumcised that he is under obligation to keep the whole law
4  you are separated from christ you who are trying to be declared righteous by means of law you have fallen away from his undeserved kindness
5  for our part we are by spirit eagerly waiting for the hopedfor righteousness resulting from faith
6  for in union with christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any value but faith operating through love is
7  you were running well
who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth
8  this sort of persuasion does not come from the one calling you
9  a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough
10  i am confident that you who are in union with the lord will not come to think otherwise but the one who is causing you trouble whoever he may be will receive the judgment he deserves
11  as for me brothers if i am still preaching circumcision why am i still being persecuted in that case the stumbling block of the torture stake has been eliminated
12  i wish the men who are trying to unsettle you would emasculate themselves
13  you were called to freedom brothers only do not use this freedom as an opportunity to pursue fleshly desires but through love slave for one another
14  for the entire law has been fulfilled in one commandment namely you must love your neighbor as yourself
15  if though you keep on biting and devouring one another look out that you do not get annihilated by one another
16  but i say keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all
17  for the flesh is against the spirit in its desire and the spirit against the flesh these are opposed to each other so that you do not do the very things you want to do
18  furthermore if you are being led by spirit you are not under law
19  now the works of the flesh are plainly seen and they are sexual immorality uncleanness brazen conduct
20  idolatry spiritism hostility strife jealousy fits of anger dissensions divisions sects
21  envy drunkenness wild parties and things like these
i am forewarning you about these things the same way i already warned you that those who practice such things will not inherit gods kingdom
22  on the other hand the fruitage of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faith
23  mildness selfcontrol
against such things there is no law
24  moreover those who belong to christ jesus have nailed to the stake the flesh together with its passions and desires
25  if we are living by spirit let us also go on walking orderly by spirit
26  let us not become egotistical stirring up competition with one another envying one another
1  paul an apostle neither from men nor through a man but through jesus christ and god the father who raised him up from the dead
2  and all the brothers with me to the congregations of galaʹtia
3  may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
4  he gave himself for our sins so that he might rescue us from the present wicked system of things according to the will of our god and father
5  to whom be the glory forever and ever
amen
6  i am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from the one who called you with christs undeserved kindness to another sort of good news
7  not that there is another good news but there are certain ones who are causing you trouble and wanting to distort the good news about the christ
8  however even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond the good news we declared to you let him be accursed
9  as we have said before i now say again whoever is declaring to you as good news something beyond what you accepted let him be accursed
10  is it in fact men i am now trying to persuade or god or am i trying to please men if i were still pleasing men i would not be christs slave
11  for i want you to know brothers that the good news i declared to you is not of human origin
12  for neither did i receive it from man nor was i taught it but it was through a revelation by jesus christ
13  of course you heard about my conduct formerly in juʹdaism that i kept intensely persecuting the congregation of god and devastating it
14  and i was making greater progress in juʹdaism than many of my own age in my nation as i was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers
15  but when god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me through his undeserved kindness thought good
16  to reveal his son through me so that i might declare the good news about him to the nations i did not immediately consult with any human
17  nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were apostles before i was but i went to arabia and then i returned to damascus
18  then three years later i went up to jerusalem to visit ceʹphas and i stayed with him for 15 days
19  but i did not see any of the other apostles only james the brother of the lord
20  now regarding the things i am writing you i assure you before god that i am not lying
21  after that i went into the regions of syria and ciliʹcia
22  but i was personally unknown to the congregations of judeʹa that were in union with christ
23  they only used to hear the man who formerly persecuted us is now declaring the good news about the faith that he formerly devastated
24  so they began glorifying god because of me
2  then after 14 years i again went up to jerusalem with barʹnabas also taking titus along with me
2  i went up as a result of a revelation and i presented to them the good news that i am preaching among the nations
this was done privately however before the men who were highly regarded to make sure that i was not running or had not run in vain
3  nevertheless not even titus who was with me was compelled to be circumcised although he was a greek
4  but that matter came up because of the false brothers brought in quietly who slipped in to spy on the freedom we enjoy in union with christ jesus so that they might completely enslave us
5  we did not yield in submission to them no not for a moment so that the truth of the good news might continue with you
6  but regarding those who seemed to be importantwhatever they were makes no difference to me for god does not go by a mans outward appearancethose highly regarded men imparted nothing new to me
7  on the contrary when they saw that i had been entrusted with the good news for those who are uncircumcised just as peter had been for those who are circumcised
8  for the one who empowered peter for an apostleship to those who are circumcised also empowered me for those who are of the nations
9  and when they recognized the undeserved kindness that was given me james and ceʹphas and john the ones who seemed to be pillars gave barʹnabas and me the right hand of fellowship so that we should go to the nations but they to those who are circumcised
10  they asked only that we keep the poor in mind and this i have also earnestly endeavored to do
11  however when ceʹphas came to antioch i resisted him facetoface because he was clearly in the wrong
12  for before certain men from james arrived he used to eat with people of the nations but when they arrived he stopped doing this and separated himself fearing those of the circumcised class
13  the rest of the jews also joined him in putting on this pretense so that even barʹnabas was led along with them in their pretense
14  but when i saw that they were not walking in step with the truth of the good news i said to ceʹphas before them all if you though you are a jew live as the nations do and not as jews do how can you compel people of the nations to live according to jewish practice
15  we who are jews by birth and not sinners from the nations
16  recognize that a man is declared righteous not by works of law but only through faith in jesus christ
so we have put our faith in christ jesus so that we may be declared righteous by faith in christ and not by works of law for no one will be declared righteous by works of law
17  now if we have also been found sinners while seeking to be declared righteous by means of christ is christ then sins minister certainly not
18  if the very things that i once tore down i build up again i demonstrate that i am a transgressor
19  for through law i died toward law so that i might become alive toward god
20  i am nailed to the stake along with christ
it is no longer i who live but it is christ who is living in union with me
indeed the life that i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and handed himself over for me
21  i do not reject the undeserved kindness of god for if righteousness is through law christ actually died for nothing
3  o senseless galaʹtians who has brought you under this evil influence you who had jesus christ openly portrayed before you as nailed to the stake
2  this one thing i want to ask you did you receive the spirit through works of law or because of faith in what you heard
3  are you so senseless after starting on a spiritual course are you finishing on a fleshly course
4  did you undergo so many sufferings for nothing if it really was for nothing
5  therefore does the one who supplies you the spirit and performs powerful works among you do it because of your works of law or because of your faith in what you heard
6  just as abraham put faith in jehovah and it was counted to him as righteousness
7  surely you know that it is those who adhere to faith who are sons of abraham
8  now the scripture foreseeing that god would declare people of the nations righteous through faith declared the good news beforehand to abraham namely by means of you all the nations will be blessed
9  so those who adhere to faith are being blessed together with abraham who had faith
10  all those who depend on works of law are under a curse for it is written cursed is everyone who does not remain in all the things written in the scroll of the law by doing them
11  moreover it is evident that by law no one is declared righteous with god because the righteous one will live by reason of faith
12  now the law is not based on faith
rather anyone who does these things will live by means of them
13  christ purchased us releasing us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse instead of us because it is written accursed is every man hung upon a stake
14  this was so that the blessing of abraham would come to the nations by means of christ jesus so that we might receive the promised spirit through our faith
15  brothers i speak using a human illustration once a covenant is validated even if only by a man no one annuls it or attaches additions to it
16  now the promises were spoken to abraham and to his offspring
it does not say and to your descendants in the sense of many
rather it says and to your offspring in the sense of one who is christ
17  further i say this the law which came into being 430 years later does not invalidate the covenant previously made by god so as to abolish the promise
18  for if the inheritance is based on law it is no longer based on a promise but god has kindly given it to abraham through a promise
19  why then the law it was added to make transgressions manifest until the offspring should arrive to whom the promise had been made and it was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator
20  now there is no mediator when just one person is involved but god is only one
21  is the law therefore against the promises of god certainly not for if a law had been given that could give life righteousness would actually have been by means of law
22  but the scripture handed all things over to the custody of sin so that the promise resulting from faith in jesus christ might be given to those exercising faith
23  however before the faith arrived we were being guarded under law being handed over into custody looking to the faith that was about to be revealed
24  so the law became our guardian leading to christ so that we might be declared righteous through faith
25  but now that the faith has arrived we are no longer under a guardian
26  you are all in fact sons of god through your faith in christ jesus
27  for all of you who were baptized into christ have put on christ
28  there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor freeman there is neither male nor female for you are all one in union with christ jesus
29  moreover if you belong to christ you are really abrahams offspring heirs with reference to a promise
