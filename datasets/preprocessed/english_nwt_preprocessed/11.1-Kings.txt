10  now the queen of sheʹba heard the report about solʹomon in connection with the name of jehovah so she came to test him with perplexing questions
2  she arrived in jerusalem with a very impressive entourage with camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones
she went in to solʹomon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart
3  solʹomon then answered all her questions
there was nothing too difficult for the king to explain to her
4  when the queen of sheʹba had seen all the wisdom of solʹomon the house that he built
5  the food of his table the seating of his servants the table service of his waiters and their attire his cupbearers and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of jehovah she was left completely breathless
6  so she said to the king the report that i heard in my own land about your achievements and about your wisdom was true
7  but i did not put faith in the reports until i had come and had seen it with my own eyes
and look i had not been told the half
you have far surpassed in wisdom and prosperity the report that i heard
8  happy are your men and happy are your servants who stand before you constantly listening to your wisdom
9  may jehovah your god be praised who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on the throne of israel
because of jehovahs everlasting love for israel he appointed you as king to administer justice and righteousness
10  then she gave the king 120 talents of gold and a great amount of balsam oil and precious stones
never again was such a quantity of balsam oil brought in as what the queen of sheʹba gave to king solʹomon
11  hiʹrams fleet of ships that carried gold from oʹphir also brought from oʹphir algum timbers in very great quantity and precious stones
12  the king made from the algum timbers supports for the house of jehovah and for the kings house as well as harps and stringed instruments for the singers
such algum timbers have never again been brought in or seen down to this day
13  king solʹomon also gave the queen of sheʹba whatever she desired and asked for in addition to what he gave her out of his own generosity
after that she left and returned to her own land together with her servants
14  and the weight of the gold that came to solʹomon in one year amounted to 666 talents of gold
15  besides that from the merchants and the profit from the traders and from all the kings of the arabs and the governors of the land
16  king solʹomon made 200 large shields of alloyed gold 600 shekels of gold went on each shield
17  and 300 bucklers of alloyed gold three miʹnas of gold went on each buckler
then the king put them in the house of the forest of lebʹanon
18  the king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with refined gold
19  there were six steps to the throne and the throne had a round canopy behind it and there were armrests on both sides of the seat and two lions were standing beside the armrests
20  and there were 12 lions standing on the six steps one at each end of the six steps
no other kingdom had made anything like it
21  all the drinking vessels of king solʹomon were of gold and all the utensils of the house of the forest of lebʹanon were of pure gold
there was nothing made of silver for silver was considered as nothing in the days of solʹomon
22  for the king had a fleet of ships of tarʹshish on the sea along with hiʹrams fleet
once every three years the fleet of ships of tarʹshish would come loaded with gold and silver ivory apes and peacocks
23  so king solʹomon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom
24  and people of all the earth sought an audience with solʹomon to hear his wisdom that god had put in his heart
25  they would each bring a giftarticles of silver articles of gold garments armor balsam oil horses and mulesand this continued year after year
26  and solʹomon kept accumulating chariots and horses he had 1400 chariots and 12000 horses and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in jerusalem
27  the king made the silver in jerusalem as plentiful as the stones and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the shepheʹlah
28  the horses of solʹomon had been imported from egypt and the company of the kings merchants would obtain the horses in droves for one price
29  each chariot imported from egypt cost 600 silver pieces and a horse cost 150 in turn they would export them to all the kings of the hitʹtites and the kings of syria
4  king solʹomon ruled over all israel
2  these were his high officials azariʹah the son of zaʹdok was the priest
3  elihorʹeph and ahiʹjah the sons of shiʹsha were secretaries jehoshʹaphat the son of ahiʹlud was the recorder
4  benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada was in charge of the army zaʹdok and abiʹathar were priests
5  azariʹah the son of nathan was over the deputies zaʹbud the son of nathan was a priest and the kings friend
6  ahiʹshar was over the household and adoniʹram the son of abʹda was over those conscripted for forced labor
7  solʹomon had 12 deputies in charge of all israel who provided the king and his household with food
each one was responsible for providing the food for one month of the year
8  these were their names the son of hur in the mountainous region of eʹphraim
9  the son of deʹker in maʹkaz shaalʹbim bethsheʹmesh and eʹlonbethhaʹnan
10  the son of heʹsed in arubʹboth he had soʹcoh and all the land of heʹpher
11  the son of abinʹadab in all the slopes of dor solʹomons daughter taʹphath became his wife
12  baʹana the son of ahiʹlud in taʹanach megidʹdo and all bethsheʹan which is beside zarʹethan below jezʹreel from bethsheʹan to aʹbelmehoʹlah to the region of jokʹmeam
13  the son of geʹber in raʹmothgilʹead he had the tent villages of jaʹir the son of manasʹseh which are in gilʹead he also had the region of arʹgob which is in baʹshan 60 large cities with walls and copper bars
14  ahinʹadab the son of idʹdo in mahanaʹim
15  ahimʹaaz in naphʹtali he took basʹemath another of solʹomons daughters as his wife
16  baʹana the son of huʹshai in ashʹer and beaʹloth
17  jehoshʹaphat the son of paruʹah in isʹsachar
18  shimʹei the son of eʹla in benjamin
19  geʹber the son of uʹri in the land of gilʹead the land of siʹhon king of the amʹorites and of og king of baʹshan
there was also one deputy in charge of all these other deputies in the land
20  judah and israel were as numerous as the grains of sand by the sea they were eating and drinking and rejoicing
21  solʹomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the river to the land of the philisʹtines and to the boundary of egypt
they brought tribute and served solʹomon all the days of his life
22  solʹomons food for each day was 30 cor measures of fine flour and 60 cor measures of flour
23  10 fattened cattle 20 pastured cattle and 100 sheep besides some stags gazelles roebucks and fattened cuckoos
24  for he controlled everything this side of the river from tiphʹsah to gazʹa including all the kings on this side of the river and he enjoyed peace in every region all around him
25  judah and israel lived in security everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree from dan to beʹersheʹba all the days of solʹomon
26  and solʹomon had 4000 stalls of horses for his chariots and 12000 horses
27  these deputies supplied food to king solʹomon and to everyone who ate at the table of king solʹomon
each was responsible for his month and saw to it that nothing was lacking
28  they also brought barley and straw wherever it was needed for the horses and for the teams of horses each according to his quota
29  and god gave solʹomon wisdom and discernment in very great measure and a broadness of heart like the sand on the seashore
30  solʹomons wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of egypt
31  he was wiser than any other man wiser than eʹthan the ezʹrahite and heʹman calʹcol and darʹda the sons of maʹhol his fame spread among all the surrounding nations
32  he composed 3000 proverbs and his songs numbered 1005
33  he would speak about the trees from the cedar in lebʹanon to the hyssop that grows on the wall he would speak about the animals the birds the creeping things and the fish
34  people from all the nations came to hear solʹomons wisdom including kings from all over the earth who had heard about his wisdom
11  but king solʹomon loved many foreign women besides the daughter of pharʹaoh moʹabite amʹmonite eʹdomite sidoʹnian and hitʹtite women
2  they were from the nations about whom jehovah had said to the israelites you must not go in among them and they should not come in among you for they will surely incline your heart to follow their gods
but solʹomon clung to them and loved them
3  and he had 700 wives who were princesses and 300 concubines and his wives gradually inclined his heart
4  in solʹomons old age his wives inclined his heart to follow other gods and his heart was not complete with jehovah his god like the heart of david his father
5  and solʹomon followed after ashʹtoreth the goddess of the sidoʹnians and milʹcom the disgusting god of the amʹmonites
6  and solʹomon did what was bad in the eyes of jehovah and he did not follow jehovah completely as david his father had done
7  it was then that solʹomon built a high place to cheʹmosh the disgusting god of moʹab on the mountain in front of jerusalem and to moʹlech the disgusting god of the amʹmonites
8  that was what he did for all his foreign wives who were making sacrificial smoke and sacrificing to their gods
9  jehovah became furious at solʹomon because his heart had inclined away from jehovah the god of israel who had appeared to him twice
10  and had warned him about this very thing that he should not go after other gods
but he did not obey what jehovah had commanded
11  jehovah now said to solʹomon because you have done this and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes as i commanded you i will surely rip the kingdom away from you and i will give it to one of your servants
12  however for the sake of your father david i will not do it in your lifetime
i will rip it out of the hand of your son
13  but i will not rip away the entire kingdom
one tribe i will give to your son for the sake of david my servant and for the sake of jerusalem which i have chosen
14  jehovah then raised up a resister against solʹomon haʹdad the eʹdomite of the royal family of eʹdom
15  when david defeated eʹdom joʹab the chief of the army went up to bury the slain and he tried to strike down every male in eʹdom
16  for joʹab and all israel stayed there for six months until he had done away with every male in eʹdom
17  but haʹdad fled with some of his fathers eʹdomite servants and they went to egypt haʹdad was then a young boy
18  so they set out from midʹian and came to paʹran
they took men with them from paʹran and came to egypt to pharʹaoh king of egypt who gave him a house assigned him a food allowance and gave him land
19  haʹdad found favor in the eyes of pharʹaoh so much so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife tahʹpenes the queen
20  in time the sister of tahʹpenes bore him a son genuʹbath and tahʹpenes brought him up in the house of pharʹaoh and genuʹbath remained in the house of pharʹaoh among the sons of pharʹaoh
21  haʹdad heard in egypt that david had been laid to rest with his forefathers and that joʹab the chief of the army had died
so haʹdad said to pharʹaoh send me away so that i may go to my own land
22  but pharʹaoh said to him what have you lacked with me that you now seek to go to your own land to this he said nothing but please send me away
23  god also raised up against solʹomon another resister reʹzon the son of eliʹada who had fled from his lord hadadeʹzer the king of zoʹbah
24  he gathered men to himself and became chief of a marauder band when david defeated them
so they went to damascus and settled there and began reigning in damascus
25  and he became a resister of israel all the days of solʹomon adding to the harm done by haʹdad and he abhorred israel while he reigned over syria
26  and there was jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat an eʹphraimite from zerʹedah a servant of solʹomons whose mothers name was zeruʹah a widow
he too began to rebel against the king
27  this is why he rebelled against the king solʹomon had built the mound and had closed up the gap of the city of david his father
28  now this jeroboʹam was a capable man
when solʹomon saw that the young man was a hard worker he made him overseer over all the compulsory service of the house of joseph
29  during that time jeroboʹam went out from jerusalem and the prophet ahiʹjah the shiʹlonite found him on the road
ahiʹjah was wearing a new garment and the two of them were by themselves in the field
30  ahiʹjah took hold of the new garment he was wearing and ripped it into 12 pieces
31  then he said to jeroboʹam take ten pieces for yourself for this is what jehovah the god of israel says here i am ripping the kingdom out of the hand of solʹomon and i will give you ten tribes
32  but one tribe will remain his for the sake of my servant david and for the sake of jerusalem the city i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel
33  i will do this because they have left me and are bowing down to ashʹtoreth the goddess of the sidoʹnians to cheʹmosh the god of moʹab and to milʹcom the god of the amʹmonites and they have not walked in my ways by doing what is right in my eyes and observing my statutes and my judgments as his father david did
34  but i will not take the entire kingdom out of his hand and i will keep him as a chieftain for all the days of his life for the sake of david my servant whom i chose because he obeyed my commandments and my statutes
35  but i will take the kingship out of the hand of his son and give it to you that is ten tribes
36  to his son i will give one tribe so that david my servant may always have a lamp before me in jerusalem the city that i have chosen for myself as the place to put my name
37  i will take you and you will reign over all that you desire and you will become king over israel
38  and if you obey all that i command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my statutes and my commandments just as david my servant did i will also be with you
i will build you a lasting house just as i have built for david and i will give you israel
39  and i will humiliate the offspring of david because of this but not always
40  so solʹomon tried to put jeroboʹam to death but jeroboʹam fled to egypt to shiʹshak the king of egypt and he remained in egypt until solʹomons death
41  as for the rest of the history of solʹomon all that he did and his wisdom is it not written in the book of the history of solʹomon
42  the length of solʹomons reign in jerusalem over all israel was 40 years
43  then solʹomon was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the city of david his father and his son rehoboʹam became king in his place
8  at that time solʹomon congregated the elders of israel all the heads of the tribes the chieftains of the paternal houses of israel
they came to king solʹomon at jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of jehovah from the city of david that is zion
2  all the men of israel assembled before king solʹomon at the festival in the month of ethʹanim that is the seventh month
3  so all the elders of israel came and the priests lifted up the ark
4  they brought up the ark of jehovah the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils that were in the tent
the priests and the levites brought them up
5  king solʹomon and the entire assembly of israel who had been summoned to meet with him were before the ark
so many sheep and cattle were being sacrificed that they could not be counted or numbered
6  then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of jehovah to its place into the innermost room of the house the most holy underneath the wings of the cherubs
7  thus the wings of the cherubs were spread out over the place of the ark so that the cherubs overshadowed the ark and its poles
8  the poles were so long that the tips of the poles were visible from the holy in front of the innermost room but they were not visible from outside
and they are there to this day
9  there was nothing in the ark but the two stone tablets that moses placed there at hoʹreb when jehovah made a covenant with the people of israel while they were coming out of the land of egypt
10  when the priests came out from the holy place the cloud filled the house of jehovah
11  the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of jehovah filled the house of jehovah
12  at that time solʹomon said jehovah said he would reside in the thick gloom
13  i have successfully built a lofty house for you an established place for you to dwell in forever
14  then the king turned around and began to bless all the congregation of israel while all the congregation of israel stood
15  he said may jehovah the god of israel be praised the one who by his own mouth promised my father david and by his own hand has given fulfillment saying
16  from the day i brought my people israel out of egypt i have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of israel in which to build a house for my name to remain there but i have chosen david to be over my people israel
17  and it was the hearts desire of my father david to build a house for the name of jehovah the god of israel
18  but jehovah said to my father david it was your hearts desire to build a house for my name and you did well to desire this in your heart
19  however you will not build the house but your own son who is to be born to you is the one who will build the house for my name
20  jehovah has carried out the promise that he made for i have succeeded my father david and i sit on the throne of israel just as jehovah promised
i have also built the house for the name of jehovah the god of israel
21  and have set up a place there for the ark containing the covenant that jehovah made with our forefathers when he was bringing them out of the land of egypt
22  then solʹomon stood before the altar of jehovah in front of all the congregation of israel and he spread his hands out to the heavens
23  and he said o jehovah the god of israel there is no god like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath keeping the covenant and showing loyal love to your servants who are walking before you with all their heart
24  you have kept the promise that you made to your servant david my father
you made the promise with your own mouth and this day you have fulfilled it with your own hand
25  and now o jehovah the god of israel keep the promise you made to your servant david my father when you said there will never fail to be a man of your line before me to sit on the throne of israel if only your sons will pay attention to their way by walking before me just as you have walked before me
26  and now o god of israel let the promise that you made to your servant david my father prove trustworthy please
27  but will god really dwell on the earth look the heavens yes the heaven of the heavens cannot contain you how much less then this house that i have built
28  now pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request for favor o jehovah my god and listen to the cry for help and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you today
29  may your eyes be open toward this house night and day toward the place of which you said my name will be there to listen to the prayer that your servant prays toward this place
30  and listen to your servants request for favor and to the request by your people israel that they pray toward this place and may you hear from your dwelling place in the heavens yes may you hear and forgive
31  when a man sins against his fellow man and is made to take an oath and is brought under liability to the oath and while under the oath he comes before your altar in this house
32  may you then hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants by pronouncing the wicked one guilty and bringing what he did on his own head and by pronouncing the righteous one innocent and rewarding him according to his own righteousness
33  when your people israel are defeated by an enemy because they kept sinning against you and they return to you and glorify your name and pray and beg you for favor in this house
34  may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people israel and bring them back to the land that you gave to their forefathers
35  when the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they kept sinning against you and they pray toward this place and glorify your name and turn back from their sin because you humbled them
36  may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants of your people israel for you will instruct them about the good way in which they should walk and bring rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance
37  if a famine occurs in the land or a pestilence a scorching blight mildew swarming locusts or voracious locusts or if their enemy besieges them in any of the cities of the land or if any other sort of plague or disease occurs
38  whatever prayer whatever request for favor may be made by any man or by all your people israel for each one knows the plague of his own heart when they spread out their hands toward this house
39  then may you hear from the heavens your dwelling place and may you forgive and take action and reward each one according to all his ways for you know his heart you alone truly know every human heart
40  so that they may fear you all the days they live on the land that you gave to our forefathers
41  also concerning the foreigner who is not part of your people israel and who comes from a distant land because of your name
42  for they will hear about your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm and he comes and prays toward this house
43  may you then listen from the heavens your dwelling place and do all that the foreigner asks of you so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you as your people israel do and may know that your name has been called on this house that i have built
44  if your people go to war against their enemy in the way that you send them and they pray to jehovah in the direction of the city that you have chosen and toward the house that i have built for your name
45  then hear from the heavens their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them
46  if they sin against you for there is no man who does not sin and you are furious with them and you abandon them to an enemy and their captors carry them off captive to the land of the enemy far or near
47  and they come to their senses in the land where they were carried off captive and they return to you and beg you for favor in the land of their captors saying we have sinned and done wrong we have acted wickedly
48  and they return to you with all their heart and all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them off captive and they pray to you in the direction of their land that you gave to their forefathers and of the city that you have chosen and the house that i have built for your name
49  then hear from the heavens your dwelling place their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them
50  and forgive your people who have sinned against you forgiving all their transgressions they committed against you
you will make them objects of pity before their captors and they will pity them
51  for they are your people and your inheritance whom you brought out of egypt from inside the ironsmelting furnace
52  may your eyes be opened to your servants request for favor and to the request for favor by your people israel by listening whenever they call to you
53  for you set them apart as your inheritance out of all the peoples of the earth just as you declared through moses your servant when you were bringing our forefathers out of egypt o sovereign lord jehovah
54  and as soon as solʹomon finished offering to jehovah this entire prayer and request for favor he rose up from before the altar of jehovah where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out to the heavens
55  he then stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice saying
56  praised be jehovah who has given a restingplace to his people israel just as he promised
not one word of all his good promise that he made through moses his servant has failed
57  may jehovah our god be with us just as he was with our forefathers
may he not abandon us nor forsake us
58  may he draw our heart toward himself to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments his regulations and his judgments which he commanded our forefathers to observe
59  and may these words of mine with which i have begged jehovah for favor be near to jehovah our god by day and night that he may execute judgment for his servant and for his people israel as each day requires
60  so that all the peoples of the earth may know that jehovah is the true god
there is no other
61  so let your heart be complete with jehovah our god by walking in his regulations and by keeping his commandments as on this day
62  now the king and all israel with him offered a grand sacrifice before jehovah
63  solʹomon offered the communion sacrifices to jehovah he offered 22000 cattle and 120000 sheep
thus the king and all the israelites inaugurated the house of jehovah
64  on that day the king had to sanctify the middle of the courtyard that is before the house of jehovah for there he had to offer up the burnt sacrifices the grain offerings and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices because the copper altar that is before jehovah was too small to contain the burnt sacrifices the grain offerings and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices
65  at that time solʹomon held the festival together with all israel a great congregation from leʹbohaʹmath down to the wadi of egypt before jehovah our god for 7 days and then another 7 days 14 days in all
66  on the following day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went to their homes rejoicing and feeling glad of heart over all the goodness that jehovah had shown to david his servant and israel his people
16  the word of jehovah against baʹasha then came to jeʹhu the son of hanaʹni saying
2  i raised you up out of the dust and made you leader over my people israel but you kept walking in the way of jeroboʹam and caused my people israel to sin so that they offended me with their sins
3  so i am making a clean sweep of baʹasha and his house and i will make his house like the house of jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat
4  anyone belonging to baʹasha who dies in the city the dogs will eat and anyone belonging to him who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat
5  as for the rest of the history of baʹasha what he did and his mightiness is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
6  then baʹasha was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in tirʹzah and eʹlah his son became king in his place
7  also through the prophet jeʹhu the son of hanaʹni jehovahs word came against baʹasha and his house both because of all the badness that he committed in the eyes of jehovah by offending him with the work of his hands becoming like the house of jeroboʹam and also because of his striking him down
8  in the 26th year of king aʹsa of judah eʹlah the son of baʹasha became king over israel in tirʹzah and he reigned for two years
9  his servant zimʹri the chief of half of his chariot forces conspired against him while he was in tirʹzah drinking himself drunk at the house of arʹza who was over the household in tirʹzah
10  zimʹri came in and struck him down and put him to death in the 27th year of king aʹsa of judah and he became king in his place
11  when he became king as soon as he sat down on his throne he struck down all the house of baʹasha
he did not spare a single male whether of his relatives or of his friends
12  thus zimʹri annihilated the whole house of baʹasha according to the word that jehovah had spoken against baʹasha through jeʹhu the prophet
13  this was for all the sins that baʹasha and his son eʹlah had committed and the sins they had caused israel to commit by offending jehovah the god of israel with their worthless idols
14  as for the rest of the history of eʹlah all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
15  in the 27th year of king aʹsa of judah zimʹri became king for seven days in tirʹzah while the troops were camped against gibʹbethon which belonged to the philisʹtines
16  in time the troops who were encamped heard it being said zimʹri has conspired and has also struck down the king
so all israel made omʹri the chief of the army king over israel on that day in the camp
17  omʹri and all israel with him went up from gibʹbethon and laid siege to tirʹzah
18  when zimʹri saw that the city had been captured he went into the fortified tower of the kings house and burned the house down over himself and he died
19  this was for his own sins that he had committed by doing what was bad in the eyes of jehovah by walking in the way of jeroboʹam and for the sin he had caused israel to commit
20  as for the rest of the history of zimʹri and his conspiracy is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
21  it was then that the people of israel were divided into two factions
one part of the people became followers of tibʹni the son of giʹnath wanting to make him king and the other part followed omʹri
22  but the people who were following omʹri prevailed over the people following tibʹni the son of giʹnath
so tibʹni died and omʹri became king
23  in the 31st year of king aʹsa of judah omʹri became king over israel and he reigned for 12 years
in tirʹzah he reigned for six years
24  he bought the mountain of samarʹia from sheʹmer for two talents of silver and he built a city on the mountain
he named the city that he built samarʹia after sheʹmer the owner of the mountain
25  omʹri kept doing what was bad in the eyes of jehovah and he was worse than all who were prior to him
26  he walked in all the ways of jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat and in the sin he had caused israel to commit by offending jehovah the god of israel with their worthless idols
27  as for the rest of the history of omʹri what he did and his mighty exploits is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
28  then omʹri was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in samarʹia and his son aʹhab became king in his place
29  aʹhab the son of omʹri became king over israel in the 38th year of king aʹsa of judah and aʹhab the son of omʹri reigned over israel in samarʹia for 22 years
30  aʹhab the son of omʹri was worse in the eyes of jehovah than all those who were prior to him
31  as if it were a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat he also took as wife jezʹebel the daughter of ethbaʹal the king of the sidoʹnians and began to serve baʹal and to bow down to him
32  further he set up an altar to baʹal at the house of baʹal that he built in samarʹia
33  aʹhab also made the sacred pole
aʹhab did more to offend jehovah the god of israel than all the kings of israel prior to him
34  in his days hiʹel the bethʹelite rebuilt jerʹicho
at the cost of abiʹram his firstborn he laid its foundation and at the cost of seʹgub his youngest he put up its doors according to the word of jehovah spoken through joshua the son of nun
18  after some time in the third year jehovahs word came to eliʹjah saying go present yourself to aʹhab and i will send rain on the surface of the ground
2  so eliʹjah went to present himself to aʹhab while the famine was severe in samarʹia
3  meanwhile aʹhab called obadiʹah who was over the household
now obadiʹah greatly feared jehovah
4  and when jezʹebel was doing away with jehovahs prophets obadiʹah took 100 prophets and hid them 50 to a cave and he supplied them with bread and water
5  aʹhab then said to obadiʹah go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys
perhaps we can find enough grass to keep the horses and mules alive and not have all our animals die
6  so they divided between themselves the land they were going to pass through
aʹhab went alone by one way and obadiʹah went alone by another way
7  as obadiʹah was on his way eliʹjah was there to meet him
at once he recognized him and fell facedown and said is this you my lord eliʹjah
8  he replied to him it is i
go and tell your lord eliʹjah is here
9  but he said what sin have i committed that you should hand your servant over to aʹhab to put me to death
10  as surely as jehovah your god is living there is not a nation or a kingdom where my lord has not sent to look for you
after they said he is not here he made the kingdom and the nation swear that they could not find you
11  now you are saying go and tell your lord eliʹjah is here
12  when i depart from you the spirit of jehovah will carry you away to a place i will not know and when i tell aʹhab and he does not find you he will surely kill me
yet your servant has feared jehovah from his youth
13  has my lord not been told what i did when jezʹebel was killing the prophets of jehovah how i hid 100 of the prophets of jehovah by groups of 50 in a cave and kept supplying them bread and water
14  but now you are saying go and tell your lord eliʹjah is here
he will certainly kill me
15  however eliʹjah said as surely as jehovah of armies whom i serve is living today i will present myself to him
16  so obadiʹah went off to meet aʹhab and told him and aʹhab went to meet eliʹjah
17  as soon as aʹhab saw eliʹjah he said to him is this you the one bringing great trouble on israel
18  to this he said i have not brought trouble on israel but you and the house of your father have by abandoning the commandments of jehovah and by following the baʹals
19  and now summon all israel to me at mount carʹmel as well as the 450 prophets of baʹal and the 400 prophets of the sacred pole who are eating at the table of jezʹebel
20  so aʹhab sent word among all the people of israel and collected the prophets together at mount carʹmel
21  then eliʹjah approached all the people and said how long will you be limping between two different opinions if jehovah is the true god follow him but if baʹal is follow him but the people did not say a word in answer to him
22  eliʹjah then said to the people i am the only prophet of jehovah left while the prophets of baʹal are 450 men
23  let them give us two young bulls and let them choose one young bull and cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but they should not put fire to it
i will prepare the other young bull and i will place it on the wood but i will not put fire to it
24  then you must call on the name of your god and i will call on the name of jehovah
the god who answers by fire will show that he is the true god
to this all the people answered what you say is good
25  eliʹjah now said to the prophets of baʹal choose one young bull and prepare it first because you are the majority
then call on the name of your god but you must not put fire to it
26  so they took the young bull that was given to them prepared it and kept calling on the name of baʹal from morning until noon saying o baʹal answer us but there was no voice and no one answering
they kept limping around the altar that they had made
27  about noon eliʹjah began to mock them and say call out at the top of your voice after all he is a god perhaps he is deep in thought or he has gone to relieve himself
or maybe he is asleep and someone needs to wake him up
28  they were calling out at the top of their voice and cutting themselves with daggers and lances according to their custom until their blood gushed out all over them
29  noon was past and they continued in a frenzy until the time the evening grain offering is presented but there was no voice and no one answering no one was paying attention
30  at length eliʹjah said to all the people approach me
so all the people approached him
then he repaired the altar of jehovah that had been torn down
31  eliʹjah then took 12 stones corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob to whom jehovahs word had come saying israel will be your name
32  with the stones he built an altar in the name of jehovah
then he made a trench all around the altar an area large enough to sow with two seah measures of seed
33  after that he put the pieces of wood in order cut the young bull into pieces and placed it on the wood
he now said fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the pieces of wood
34  then he said do it again
so they did it again
once more he said do it a third time
so they did it a third time
35  and the water ran all around the altar and he also filled the trench with water
36  about the time when the evening grain offering is presented eliʹjah the prophet stepped forward and said o jehovah the god of abraham isaac and israel today let it be known that you are god in israel and that i am your servant and that it is by your word that i have done all these things
37  answer me o jehovah answer me so that this people may know that you jehovah are the true god and that you are turning their hearts back to you
38  at that the fire of jehovah fell from above and consumed the burnt offering the pieces of wood the stones and the dust and it licked up the water from the trench
39  when all the people saw it they immediately fell facedown and said jehovah is the true god jehovah is the true god
40  then eliʹjah said to them seize the prophets of baʹal do not let a single one of them escape at once they seized them and eliʹjah brought them down to the stream of kiʹshon and slaughtered them there
41  eliʹjah now said to aʹhab go up eat and drink for there is the sound of a heavy downpour
42  so aʹhab went up to eat and drink while eliʹjah went up to the top of carʹmel and crouched on the ground keeping his face between his knees
43  then he said to his attendant go up please and look toward the sea
so he went up and looked and said there is nothing at all
seven times eliʹjah said go back
44  the seventh time his attendant said look there is a small cloud like a mans hand ascending out of the sea
he now said go say to aʹhab hitch up the chariot go down so that the downpour may not detain you
45  meanwhile the sky grew dark with clouds the wind blew and a heavy downpour fell and aʹhab kept riding and made his way to jezʹreel
46  but the hand of jehovah came on eliʹjah and he wrapped his garment around his hips and ran ahead of aʹhab all the way to jezʹreel
17  now eliʹjah the tishʹbite an inhabitant of gilʹead said to aʹhab as surely as jehovah the god of israel whom i serve is living during these years there will be no dew or rain except by my word
2  the word of jehovah came to him saying
3  leave here and turn eastward and hide at the valley of cheʹrith east of the jordan
4  you should drink from the stream and i will command the ravens to supply you food there
5  he immediately went and did according to the word of jehovah he went and stayed by the valley of cheʹrith east of the jordan
6  and the ravens were bringing him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening and he drank from the stream
7  but after some days the stream ran dry because there was no rain in the land
8  the word of jehovah then came to him
9  rise up go to zarʹephath which belongs to siʹdon and stay there
look i will command a widow there to supply you with food
10  so he rose up and went to zarʹephath
when he came to the entrance of the city there was a widow gathering pieces of wood
so he called to her and said please bring me a little water in a cup so that i may drink
11  as she went to get it he called to her please bring me a piece of bread in your hand
12  at this she said as surely as jehovah your god is living i have no bread only a handful of flour in the large jar and a little oil in the small jar
now i am gathering a few pieces of wood and i will go in and make something for me and my son
after we have eaten we will die
13  then eliʹjah said to her do not be afraid
go in and do as you said
but first make me a small round loaf of bread with what is there and bring it out to me
then you can make something afterward for you and your son
14  for this is what jehovah the god of israel says the large jar of flour will not run out and the small jar of oil will not run dry until the day jehovah makes it rain on the surface of the ground
15  so she went and did as eliʹjah said and she together with him and her household ate for many days
16  the large jar of flour did not run out and the small jar of oil did not run dry according to jehovahs word that he had spoken through eliʹjah
17  after these things the son of the woman who owned the house fell sick and his sickness became so severe that he stopped breathing
18  at this she said to eliʹjah what do you have against me o man of the true god have you come to remind me of my guilt and to put my son to death
19  but he said to her give me your son
then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the roof chamber where he was staying and he laid him on his own bed
20  he called out to jehovah o jehovah my god are you also bringing harm to the widow with whom i am staying by putting her son to death
21  then he stretched himself out over the child three times and called out to jehovah o jehovah my god please let this childs life come back into him
22  jehovah listened to eliʹjahs request and the life of the child came back into him and he revived
23  eliʹjah took the child and brought him down from the roof chamber into the house and gave him to his mother and eliʹjah said see your son is alive
24  at that the woman said to eliʹjah now i know that you truly are a man of god and that jehovahs word in your mouth is truth
9  as soon as solʹomon had finished building the house of jehovah the house of the king and everything solʹomon desired to make
2  jehovah appeared to solʹomon a second time just as he had appeared to him in gibʹeon
3  jehovah said to him i have heard your prayer and your request for favor that you made before me
i have sanctified this house that you built by permanently putting my name there and my eyes and my heart will always be there
4  and you if you walk before me as your father david walked with integrity of heart and with uprightness by doing everything i have commanded you and you obey my regulations and my judgments
5  then i will establish the throne of your kingdom over israel forever just as i promised your father david saying there will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of israel
6  but if you and your sons turn away from following me and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that i have put before you and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them
7  i will cut israel off from the surface of the land that i have given to them and the house that i have sanctified for my name i will cast out of my sight and israel will become an object of scorn and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples
8  and this house will become heaps of ruins
everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will whistle and say why did jehovah do that to this land and this house
9  then they will say it was because they abandoned jehovah their god who had brought their forefathers out of the land of egypt and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them
that is why jehovah brought all this calamity on them
10  at the end of 20 years during which solʹomon built the two houses the house of jehovah and the house of the king
11  hiʹram the king of tyre had supplied solʹomon with cedar and juniper timbers and with as much gold as he desired and king solʹomon gave to hiʹram 20 cities in the land of galʹilee
12  so hiʹram went out from tyre to see the cities that solʹomon had given him but he was not satisfied with them
13  he said what sort of cities are these that you have given me my brother so they came to be called the land of caʹbul down to this day
14  in the meantime hiʹram sent to the king 120 talents of gold
15  this is the account of those whom king solʹomon conscripted for forced labor to build the house of jehovah his own house the mound the wall of jerusalem haʹzor megidʹdo and geʹzer
16  pharʹaoh king of egypt had come up and captured geʹzer and had burned it with fire and he had also killed the caʹnaanites dwelling in the city
so he gave it as a parting gift to his daughter the wife of solʹomon
17  solʹomon built up geʹzer lower bethhoʹron
18  baʹalath and taʹmar in the wilderness within the land
19  as well as all of solʹomons storage cities the chariot cities the cities for the horsemen and whatever solʹomon desired to build in jerusalem in lebʹanon and in all the land of his dominion
20  as for all the people who were left from the amʹorites the hitʹtites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites who were not part of the people of israel
21  their descendants who were left in the landthose whom the israelites had been unable to devote to destructionwere conscripted by solʹomon for forced labor as slaves until this day
22  but solʹomon did not make any of the israelites slaves for they were his warriors servants princes adjutants and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen
23  there were 550 chiefs of the deputies who were over the work of solʹomon the foremen over the people who were doing the work
24  but pharʹaohs daughter came up from the city of david to her own house that he had built for her then he built the mound
25  three times a year solʹomon offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices on the altar that he had built for jehovah also making sacrificial smoke on the altar which was before jehovah so he completed the house
26  king solʹomon also made a fleet of ships in eʹziongeʹber which is by eʹloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of eʹdom
27  hiʹram sent his own servants with the fleet of ships experienced seamen to serve along with the servants of solʹomon
28  they went to oʹphir and took from there 420 talents of gold and brought it to king solʹomon
7  and it took solʹomon 13 years to build his own house until his whole house was completed
2  and he built the house of the forest of lebʹanon 100 cubits long 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high on four rows of cedar pillars and there were cedar beams on the pillars
3  it was paneled above with cedar on the girders that rested on the pillars they numbered 45 with 15 to a row
4  there were three rows of framed windows and each window was opposite another window in three tiers
5  all the entrances and the doorposts had square frames as did the front of the windows that were opposite each other in three tiers
6  and he built the hall of pillars 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide and there was a porch in front of it with pillars and a canopy
7  he also built the hall of the throne where he would judgethe hall of judgmentand they paneled it with cedar from the floor to the rafters
8  the house where he was to live at the other courtyard was set back from the hall and it was similar in workmanship
he also built a house similar to this hall for pharʹaohs daughter whom solʹomon had taken as a wife
9  all of these were made of expensive stones hewn according to measure trimmed with stonesaws inside and out from the foundation up to the coping and outside as far as the great courtyard
10  and the foundation was laid with very large expensive stones some stones measured ten cubits and other stones eight cubits
11  and above these were expensive stones hewn according to measure as well as cedar
12  around the great courtyard were three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams like that for the inner courtyard of the house of jehovah and the porch of the house
13  king solʹomon sent for hiʹram and brought him from tyre
14  he was the son of a widow from the tribe of naphʹtali and his father was a tyrʹian coppersmith and he had great skill understanding and experience for all kinds of work in copper
so he came to king solʹomon and did all his work
15  he cast the two pillars of copper each pillar was 18 cubits high and it took a measuring cord 12 cubits long to encircle each of the two pillars
16  and he made two capitals cast in copper to put on the tops of the pillars
one capital was five cubits high and the other capital was five cubits high
17  the capital on top of each pillar had mesh network with wreathed chains seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital
18  and he made pomegranates in two rows around the one network to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars he did the same for both capitals
19  the capitals on top of the pillars at the porch were of a lily pattern four cubits high
20  the capitals were on the two pillars just above the rounded portion adjoining the network and there were 200 pomegranates in rows all around on each capital
21  he set up the pillars of the porch of the temple
he set up the righthand pillar and named it jaʹchin and then he set up the lefthand pillar and named it boʹaz
22  and the top of the pillars were of a lily pattern
so the work of the pillars was completed
23  then he made the sea of cast metal
it was circular in shape 10 cubits from brim to brim and 5 cubits high and it took a measuring line 30 cubits long to encircle it
24  and there were ornamental gourds below its brim completely encircling it ten to a cubit all around the sea with two rows of the gourds cast in one piece with it
25  it stood on 12 bulls 3 facing north 3 facing west 3 facing south and 3 facing east and the sea rested on them and all their hindquarters were toward the center
26  and its thickness was a handbreadth and its brim was made like the brim of a cup like a lily blossom
it would hold 2000 bath measures
27  then he made the ten carriages of copper
each carriage was four cubits long four cubits wide and three cubits high
28  and this was how the carriages were constructed they had side panels and the side panels were between the crossbars
29  and on the side panels between the crossbars were lions bulls and cherubs and the same design was on the crossbars
above and beneath the lions and the bulls were wreaths in relief
30  and each carriage had four copper wheels and copper axles and its four cornerpieces served as supports for them
beneath the basin were the supports cast with wreaths at the side of each
31  its opening was inside the crown extending upward one cubit and its opening was round making up a stand of one and a half cubits and on its mouth were engravings
and their side panels were square not round
32  the four wheels were below the side panels and the supports of the wheels were attached to the carriage and the height of each wheel was one and a half cubits
33  and the wheels were made like chariot wheels
their supports rims spokes and hubs were all of cast metal
34  there were four supports on the four corners of each carriage its supports were cast as part of the carriage
35  on top of the carriage was a circular band half a cubit high and on the top of the carriage its framing pieces and its side panels were cast as part of it
36  on the surfaces of its framing pieces and on its side panels he engraved cherubs lions and palm trees according to the amount of space on each with wreaths all around
37  this is how he made the ten carriages they were all cast alike with the same measure and shape
38  he made ten copper basins each could hold 40 bath measures
each basin measured four cubits
there was one basin for each of the ten carriages
39  then he put five carriages on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he placed the sea on the right side of the house toward the southeast
40  hiʹram also made the basins the shovels and the bowls
so hiʹram finished all the work that he did for king solʹomon on the house of jehovah
41  the two pillars and the bowlshaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars the two networks to cover the two bowlshaped capitals that were on top of the pillars
42  the 400 pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowlshaped capitals that were on the two pillars
43  the ten carriages and the ten basins on the carriages
44  the sea and the 12 bulls beneath the sea
45  and the cans the shovels the bowls and all the utensils which hiʹram made of polished copper for king solʹomon for the house of jehovah
46  the king cast them in clay molds in the district of the jordan between sucʹcoth and zarʹethan
47  solʹomon left all the utensils unweighed because they were in such great quantities
the weight of the copper was not ascertained
48  solʹomon made all the utensils for the house of jehovah the altar of gold the gold table on which to put the showbread
49  the lampstands of pure gold five on the right and five on the left before the innermost room and the blossoms the lamps and the snuffers of gold
50  the basins the extinguishers the bowls the cups and the fire holders of pure gold and the sockets for the doors of the inner house that is the most holy and for the doors of the house of the temple of gold
51  so king solʹomon completed all the work he had to do for the house of jehovah
solʹomon then brought in the things that david his father had made holy and he put the silver the gold and the articles into the treasuries of the house of jehovah
22  for three years there was no war between syria and israel
2  in the third year king jehoshʹaphat of judah went down to the king of israel
3  then the king of israel said to his servants do you know that raʹmothgilʹead belongs to us and yet we are hesitating to take it back from the king of syria
4  he then said to jehoshʹaphat will you go with me to fight at raʹmothgilʹead jehoshʹaphat replied to the king of israel i am the same as you
my people are the same as your people
my horses are the same as your horses
5  but jehoshʹaphat said to the king of israel first inquire please for the word of jehovah
6  so the king of israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men and said to them should i go to war against raʹmothgilʹead or should i refrain they said go up and jehovah will give it into the kings hand
7  jehoshʹaphat then said is there not here a prophet of jehovah let us also inquire through him
8  at that the king of israel said to jehoshʹaphat there is still one more man through whom we can inquire of jehovah but i hate him for he never prophesies good things concerning me only bad
he is micaiʹah the son of imʹlah
however jehoshʹaphat said the king should not say such a thing
9  so the king of israel called a court official and said bring micaiʹah the son of imʹlah quickly
10  now the king of israel and jehoshʹaphat the king of judah were each sitting on his throne dressed in royal attire at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of samarʹia and all the prophets were prophesying before them
11  then zedekiʹah the son of chenaʹanah made for himself iron horns and said this is what jehovah says with these you will gore the syrians until you exterminate them
12  all the other prophets were prophesying the same way saying go up to raʹmothgilʹead and you will be successful jehovah will give it into the kings hand
13  so the messenger who went to call micaiʹah said to him look the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king
let your word please become like their words and speak favorably
14  but micaiʹah said as surely as jehovah is living whatever jehovah says to me is what i will speak
15  then he came in to the king and the king asked him micaiʹah should we go to war against raʹmothgilʹead or should we refrain at once he replied go up and you will be successful jehovah will give it into the kings hand
16  at that the king said to him how many times must i put you under oath not to speak to me anything but the truth in the name of jehovah
17  so he said i see all the israelites scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd
jehovah said these have no master
let each one go back to his house in peace
18  then the king of israel said to jehoshʹaphat did i not tell you he will not prophesy good things concerning me only bad
19  micaiʹah then said therefore hear the word of jehovah i saw jehovah sitting on his throne and all the army of the heavens standing by him to his right and to his left
20  jehovah then said who will fool aʹhab so that he will go up and fall at raʹmothgilʹead and one was saying one thing while another said something else
21  then a spirit came forward and stood before jehovah and said i will fool him
jehovah asked him how will you do it
22  he replied i will go out and become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets
so he said you will fool him and what is more you will be successful
go out and do that
23  and now jehovah has put a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours but jehovah has declared calamity for you
24  zedekiʹah the son of chenaʹanah now approached and struck micaiʹah on the cheek and said which way did the spirit of jehovah pass from me to speak with you
25  micaiʹah replied look you will see which way on the day when you will enter the innermost room to hide
26  then the king of israel said take micaiʹah and turn him over to aʹmon the chief of the city and to joʹash the kings son
27  tell them this is what the king says put this fellow in the prison and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and water until i return in peace
28  but micaiʹah said if you do return in peace jehovah has not spoken with me
then he added take note all you peoples
29  so the king of israel and jehoshʹaphat the king of judah went up to raʹmothgilʹead
30  the king of israel now said to jehoshʹaphat i will disguise myself and will go into the battle but you should put on your royal attire
so the king of israel disguised himself and entered the battle
31  now the king of syria had ordered his 32 chariot commanders do not fight with anyone small or great except the king of israel
32  and as soon as the chariot commanders saw jehoshʹaphat they said to themselves surely it is the king of israel
so they turned to fight against him and jehoshʹaphat began to cry for help
33  when the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of israel they immediately turned back from following him
34  but one man shot his bow at random and he struck the king of israel between the joints of his coat of mail
so the king said to his charioteer turn around and take me out of the battle for i have been badly wounded
35  the fighting raged throughout that day and the king had to be propped up in the chariot facing the syrians
the blood of the wound poured out into the interior of the war chariot and he died in the evening
36  around sunset a cry passed through the camp saying everyone to his city everyone to his land
37  thus the king died and he was brought to samarʹia they buried the king in samarʹia
38  when they washed off the war chariot by the pool of samarʹia the dogs licked up his blood and the prostitutes bathed there according to the word that jehovah had spoken
39  as for the rest of the history of aʹhab all that he did and the house of ivory that he built and all the cities that he built is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
40  then aʹhab was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son ahaziʹah became king in his place
41  jehoshʹaphat the son of aʹsa had become king over judah in the fourth year of king aʹhab of israel
42  jehoshʹaphat was 35 years old when he became king and he reigned for 25 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was azuʹbah the daughter of shilʹhi
43  he kept walking in all the way of aʹsa his father
he did not deviate from it and he did what was right in jehovahs eyes
however the high places were not removed and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places
44  jehoshʹaphat kept peaceful relations with the king of israel
45  as for the rest of the history of jehoshʹaphat his mighty exploits and how he waged war is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
46  he also cleared out of the land the rest of the male temple prostitutes who had been left over in the days of aʹsa his father
47  then there was no king in eʹdom a deputy was acting as king
48  jehoshʹaphat also made tarʹshish ships to go to oʹphir for gold but they did not go because the ships were wrecked at eʹziongeʹber
49  it was then that ahaziʹah the son of aʹhab said to jehoshʹaphat let my servants go with your servants in the ships but jehoshʹaphat did not consent
50  then jehoshʹaphat was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the city of david his forefather and his son jehoʹram became king in his place
51  ahaziʹah the son of aʹhab became king over israel in samarʹia in the 17th year of king jehoshʹaphat of judah and he reigned over israel for two years
52  and he kept doing what was bad in jehovahs eyes and walking in the way of his father and his mother and in the way of jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat who had caused israel to sin
53  he continued serving baʹal and bowing down to him and kept offending jehovah the god of israel just as his father had done
6  in the 480th year after the israelites came out of the land of egypt in the fourth year after solʹomon became king over israel in the month of ziv that is the second month he began to build the house of jehovah
2  the house that king solʹomon built for jehovah was 60 cubits long 20 cubits wide and 30 cubits high
3  the porch in front of the temple was 20 cubits long corresponding to the width of the house
its depth was ten cubits from the front of the house
4  he made windows of narrowing frames for the house
5  further he built a side structure against the wall of the house it went around the walls of the house those of the temple and the innermost room and he made side chambers all around
6  the lowest level of the side chambers was five cubits wide the middle level was six cubits wide and the third level was seven cubits wide for he made offsets all around the house so that nothing was attached to the walls of the house
7  the house was built with quarry stone that had already been prepared so that no hammers or axes or any iron tools were heard in the house while it was being built
8  the entrance of the lowest side chamber was on the south side of the house and a winding staircase led up to the middle floor and from the middle floor up to the third floor
9  he continued building the house and finished it and covered the house with cedar beams and rows of cedar planks
10  he built the side chambers all around the house each five cubits high and they were joined to the house by cedar timbers
11  meanwhile the word of jehovah came to solʹomon saying
12  as for this house that you are building if you walk in my statutes and carry out my judgments and observe all my commandments by walking in them i will also carry out with you my promise that i made to david your father
13  and i will reside in the midst of the israelites and i will not forsake my people israel
14  solʹomon continued building the house to finish it
15  he built the inside walls of the house with cedar boards
he paneled the inside walls with timber from the floor of the house up to the rafters of the ceiling and he overlaid the floor of the house with juniper boards
16  and he built a section of 20 cubits at the rear of the house with cedar boards from the floor up to the rafters and he built inside of it the innermost room the most holy
17  and the templethe part of the house in front of itwas 40 cubits
18  the cedar inside the house was carved with gourds and flowers in bloom
all of it was cedar no stone was seen
19  and he prepared the innermost room inside the house to put there the ark of the covenant of jehovah
20  the innermost room was 20 cubits long 20 cubits wide and 20 cubits high and he overlaid it with pure gold he overlaid the altar with cedar
21  solʹomon overlaid the interior of the house with pure gold and he stretched gold chains in front of the innermost room which was overlaid with gold
22  he overlaid the whole house with gold until all the house was completed he also overlaid with gold the entire altar near the innermost room
23  in the innermost room he made two cherubs of pinewood each ten cubits high
24  one wing of the cherub measured five cubits and the other wing was five cubits
from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing was ten cubits
25  the second cherub was also ten cubits
the two cherubs had the same size and shape
26  the height of the one cherub was ten cubits as was that of the other cherub
27  then he put the cherubs inside the inner house
the wings of the cherubs were extended so that the wing of the one cherub reached to one wall and the wing of the other cherub reached to the other wall and their wings extended toward the middle of the house so that the wings touched
28  and he overlaid the cherubs with gold
29  and on all the walls of the house all around both the inner and outer rooms he carved figures of cherubs palm trees and flowers in bloom
30  he overlaid the floor of the house with gold in the inner and outer rooms
31  and for the entrance of the innermost room he made doors of pinewood side pillars and doorposts as a fifth part
32  the two doors were of pinewood and he carved on them cherubs palm trees and flowers in bloom and he overlaid them with gold and he hammered the gold down over the cherubs and the palm trees
33  for the entrance of the temple that was how he made the doorposts of pinewood belonging to a fourth part
34  and he made two doors of juniper wood
the one door had two leaves that turned on pivots and the other door had two leaves that turned on pivots
35  he carved cherubs palm trees and flowers in bloom and overlaid gold foil on the carvings
36  he built the inner courtyard with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams
37  in the 4th year in the month of ziv the house of jehovah had its foundation laid
38  and in the 11th year in the month of bul that is the eighth month the house was finished in all its details and according to its plan
so he spent seven years building it
21  after these things an incident took place concerning a vineyard that belonged to naʹboth the jezʹreelite it was in jezʹreel next to the palace of aʹhab the king of samarʹia
2  aʹhab said to naʹboth give me your vineyard for me to use as a vegetable garden for it is near my house
then i will give you a better vineyard to replace it
or if you prefer i will give you its value in money
3  but naʹboth said to aʹhab it is unthinkable from jehovahs standpoint for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers
4  so aʹhab came into his house sullen and dejected over the answer that naʹboth the jezʹreelite had given him when he said i will not give you the inheritance of my forefathers
then he lay down on his bed kept his face turned away and refused to eat
5  his wife jezʹebel came in to him and asked him why are you so sad that you refuse to eat
6  he replied to her because i said to naʹboth the jezʹreelite give me your vineyard for money
or if you prefer let me give you another vineyard to replace it
but he said i will not give you my vineyard
7  his wife jezʹebel said to him are you not the one ruling as king over israel get up eat something and let your heart be cheerful
i will give you the vineyard of naʹboth the jezʹreelite
8  so she wrote letters in aʹhabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived in naʹboths city
9  she wrote in the letters proclaim a fast and have naʹboth sit at the head of the people
10  and have two goodfornothing men sit in front of him and testify against him saying you have cursed god and the king then bring him out and stone him to death
11  so the men of his city the elders and the nobles who lived in his city did just as was written in the letters that jezʹebel sent to them
12  they proclaimed a fast and had naʹboth sit at the head of the people
13  then two of the goodfornothing men came in and sat down in front of him and began to testify against naʹboth in front of the people saying naʹboth has cursed god and the king after that they brought him to the outskirts of the city and stoned him to death
14  they now sent word to jezʹebel saying naʹboth has been stoned to death
15  as soon as jezʹebel heard that naʹboth had been stoned to death she said to aʹhab get up take possession of the vineyard of naʹboth the jezʹreelite which he refused to give you for money for naʹboth is no longer alive
he is dead
16  as soon as aʹhab heard that naʹboth was dead aʹhab got up to go down to the vineyard of naʹboth the jezʹreelite to take possession of it
17  but jehovahs word came to eliʹjah the tishʹbite saying
18  get up go down to meet aʹhab the king of israel who is in samarʹia
there he is in the vineyard of naʹboth where he has gone to take possession of it
19  you must tell him this is what jehovah says have you murdered a man and also taken his property then say to him this is what jehovah says in the place where the dogs licked up the blood of naʹboth the dogs will lick up your own blood
20  aʹhab said to eliʹjah so you have found me o my enemy he replied i have found you
because you are determined to do what is bad in the eyes of jehovah
21  here i am bringing calamity upon you and i will make a clean sweep after you and will annihilate from aʹhab every male including the helpless and weak in israel
22  and i will make your house like the house of jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat and like the house of baʹasha the son of ahiʹjah for you have provoked my anger and have caused israel to sin
23  also concerning jezʹebel jehovah has said the dogs will eat up jezʹebel in the plot of land of jezʹreel
24  anyone belonging to aʹhab who dies in the city the dogs will eat up and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat up
25  indeed there has never been anyone like aʹhab who was so determined to do what was bad in the eyes of jehovah egged on by his wife jezʹebel
26  he acted in the most detestable way by going after the disgusting idols just as all the amʹorites had done whom jehovah drove out from before the israelites
27  as soon as aʹhab heard these words he ripped his garments apart and put sackcloth on his body and he went on a fast and kept lying down in sackcloth and walking despondently
28  jehovahs word then came to eliʹjah the tishʹbite
29  have you seen how aʹhab has humbled himself on my account because he has humbled himself before me i will not bring the calamity during his lifetime
i will bring the calamity upon his house in the days of his son
13  by the word of jehovah a man of god came from judah to bethʹel while jeroboʹam was standing by the altar to make sacrificial smoke
2  then he called out against the altar by the word of jehovah and said o altar altar this is what jehovah says look a son named josiʹah will be born to the house of david he will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places those making sacrificial smoke on you and he will burn human bones on you
3  he gave a sign on that day saying this is the sign that jehovah has declared look the altar will be ripped apart and the ashes that are on it will be spilled out
4  as soon as the king heard the word that the man of the true god had called out against the altar at bethʹel jeroboʹam stretched out his hand from the altar and said seize him immediately the hand that he had stretched out against him dried up and he could not draw it back
5  then the altar was ripped apart and the ashes were spilled out from the altar according to the sign that the man of the true god had given by the word of jehovah
6  the king now said to the man of the true god please beg for the favor of jehovah your god and pray in my behalf that my hand may be restored to me
at this the man of the true god begged for the favor of jehovah and the kings hand was restored to its former condition
7  the king then said to the man of the true god come home with me and take some food and let me give you a gift
8  but the man of the true god said to the king even if you gave me half your house i would not come with you and eat bread or drink water in this place
9  for this is what i was commanded by the word of jehovah you must not eat bread or drink water and you must not return by the way you came
10  so he left by another way and he did not return by the way he had come to bethʹel
11  there was a certain old prophet dwelling in bethʹel and his sons came home and related to him all the things that the man of the true god had done that day in bethʹel and the words he had spoken to the king
after they related this to their father
12  their father asked them which way did he go so his sons showed him the way that the man of the true god from judah had gone
13  he now said to his sons saddle the donkey for me
they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it
14  he followed the man of the true god and found him sitting under a big tree
then he said to him are you the man of the true god who came from judah he replied i am
15  he said to him come home with me and eat bread
16  but he said i cannot go back with you or accept your invitation nor may i eat bread or drink water with you in this place
17  for i was told by the word of jehovah you must not eat bread or drink water there
you must not return by the way you came
18  at this he said to him i too am a prophet like you and an angel told me by the word of jehovah have him come back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water
he deceived him
19  so he went back with him to eat bread and drink water in his house
20  while they were sitting at the table the word of jehovah came to the prophet who had brought him back
21  and he called out to the man of the true god from judah saying this is what jehovah says because you rebelled against the order of jehovah and did not keep the commandment that jehovah your god gave you
22  but you went back to eat bread and drink water in the place about which you were told do not eat bread or drink water your dead body will not come into the tomb of your forefathers
23  after the man of the true god ate bread and drank the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back
24  then he got on his way but a lion came across him on the road and killed him
his dead body was thrown onto the road and the donkey stood beside it the lion was also standing beside the dead body
25  there were men passing by who saw the dead body thrown onto the road and the lion standing beside the dead body
they came in and told about it in the city where the old prophet lived
26  when the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard of it he immediately said it is the man of the true god who rebelled against the order of jehovah so jehovah gave him over to the lion to maul and to kill him according to the word of jehovah that he spoke to him
27  he then said to his sons saddle the donkey for me
so they saddled it
28  then he went on his way and found the dead body thrown onto the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it
the lion had not eaten the dead body nor had it mauled the donkey
29  the prophet lifted up the dead body of the man of the true god and put him on the donkey and he brought him back into his own city to mourn and bury him
30  so he laid the dead body in his own tomb and they kept crying out over him too bad my brother
31  after burying him he told his sons when i die you must bury me in the place where the man of the true god is buried
lay my bones next to his bones
32  the word that he called out by the word of jehovah against the altar in bethʹel and against all the houses of worship on the high places in the cities of samarʹia is sure to take place
33  even after this happened jeroboʹam did not turn back from his bad way but he kept appointing priests for the high places from the people in general
he would install as priests anyone who so desired saying let him become one of the priests for the high places
34  this sin on the part of the household of jeroboʹam led to their destruction and annihilation from the face of the earth
14  at that time abiʹjah the son of jeroboʹam fell sick
2  so jeroboʹam said to his wife rise up please and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are jeroboʹams wife and go to shiʹloh
look ahiʹjah the prophet is there
he is the one who spoke of me becoming king over this people
3  take with you ten loaves of bread sprinkled cakes and a flask of honey and go to him
he will then tell you what is going to happen to the boy
4  jeroboʹams wife did what he said
she rose up and went to shiʹloh and came to the house of ahiʹjah
ahiʹjahs eyes stared straight ahead and he could not see because of his age
5  but jehovah had told ahiʹjah here is the wife of jeroboʹam coming to inquire of you regarding her son for he is sick
i will tell you what to say to her
when she arrives she will conceal her identity
6  as soon as ahiʹjah heard the sound of her footsteps as she was coming into the entrance he said come in wife of jeroboʹam
why are you concealing your identity i have been assigned to give you a harsh message
7  go tell jeroboʹam this is what jehovah the god of israel says i raised you up from among your people to make you a leader over my people israel
8  then i ripped the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it to you
but you have not become like my servant david who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart doing only what was right in my eyes
9  but you have done worse than all those who were prior to you and you made for yourself another god and metal images to offend me and it is i whom you have turned your back on
10  for that reason i am bringing calamity on the house of jeroboʹam and i will annihilate from jeroboʹam every male including the helpless and weak in israel and i will make a clean sweep of the house of jeroboʹam just as one clears away the dung until it is all gone
11  anyone belonging to jeroboʹam who dies in the city the dogs will eat and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat for jehovah has spoken it
12  now rise up go to your house
when you set foot in the city the child will die
13  all israel will mourn him and bury him for he alone of jeroboʹams family will be laid in a grave because he is the only one of the house of jeroboʹam in whom jehovah the god of israel has found something good
14  jehovah will raise up for himself a king over israel who will do away with the house of jeroboʹam from that day forward yes even now
15  jehovah will strike israel down like a reed that sways in the water and he will uproot israel off this good land that he gave to their forefathers and he will scatter them beyond the river because they made their sacred poles offending jehovah
16  and he will abandon israel because of the sins that jeroboʹam has committed and has caused israel to commit
17  at that jeroboʹams wife rose up and went on her way and came to tirʹzah
as she came to the threshold of the house the boy died
18  so they buried him and all israel mourned him according to jehovahs word that he had spoken through his servant ahiʹjah the prophet
19  and the rest of the history of jeroboʹam how he waged war and how he reigned is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
20  and the length of jeroboʹams reign was 22 years after which he was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son naʹdab became king in his place
21  meanwhile rehoboʹam the son of solʹomon had become king in judah
rehoboʹam was 41 years old when he became king and he reigned for 17 years in jerusalem the city that jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of israel as the place to put his name
the name of rehoboʹams mother was naʹamah the amʹmonitess
22  and judah was doing what was bad in the eyes of jehovah and by the sins they committed they provoked him more than their forefathers had done
23  they too kept building for themselves high places sacred pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree
24  there were also male temple prostitutes in the land
they acted according to all the detestable things of the nations that jehovah had driven out before the israelites
25  in the fifth year of king rehoboʹam king shiʹshak of egypt came up against jerusalem
26  he took the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the kings house
he took everything including all the gold shields that solʹomon had made
27  so king rehoboʹam made copper shields to replace them and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard who guarded the entrance of the kings house
28  whenever the king came to the house of jehovah the guards would carry them and then they would return them to the guard chamber
29  and the rest of the history of rehoboʹam all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
30  there was constant warfare between rehoboʹam and jeroboʹam
31  then rehoboʹam was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the city of david
his mothers name was naʹamah the amʹmonitess
and his son abiʹjam became king in his place
19  then aʹhab told jezʹebel all that eliʹjah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword
2  at that jezʹebel sent a messenger to eliʹjah saying so may the gods do to me and add to it if by this time tomorrow i do not make you like each one of them
3  at that he became afraid so he got up and ran for his life
he came to beʹersheʹba which belongs to judah and he left his attendant there
4  he went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree and he asked that he might die
he said it is enough now o jehovah take my life away for i am no better than my forefathers
5  then he lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree
but suddenly an angel touched him and said to him get up and eat
6  when he looked there at his head was a round loaf on heated stones and a jug of water
he ate and drank and lay down again
7  later the angel of jehovah came back a second time and touched him and said get up and eat for the journey will be too much for you
8  so he got up and ate and drank and in the strength of that nourishment he went on for 40 days and 40 nights until he reached hoʹreb the mountain of the true god
9  there he entered a cave and spent the night and look jehovahs word came to him telling him what are you doing here eliʹjah
10  to this he said i have been absolutely zealous for jehovah the god of armies for the people of israel have forsaken your covenant your altars they have torn down and your prophets they have killed with the sword and i am the only one left
now they are seeking to take my life away
11  but he said go out and stand on the mountain before jehovah
and look jehovah was passing by and a great and strong wind was splitting mountains and breaking crags before jehovah but jehovah was not in the wind
after the wind there was an earthquake but jehovah was not in the earthquake
12  after the earthquake there was a fire but jehovah was not in the fire
after the fire there was a calm low voice
13  as soon as eliʹjah heard it he wrapped his face in his official garment and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave
then a voice asked him what are you doing here eliʹjah
14  to this he said i have been absolutely zealous for jehovah the god of armies for the people of israel have forsaken your covenant your altars they have torn down and your prophets they have killed with the sword and i am the only one left
now they are seeking to take my life away
15  jehovah said to him return and go to the wilderness of damascus
when you arrive anoint hazʹael as king over syria
16  and you should anoint jeʹhu the grandson of nimʹshi as king over israel and you should anoint eliʹsha the son of shaʹphat from aʹbelmehoʹlah as prophet to take your place
17  anyone escaping from hazʹaels sword jeʹhu will put to death and anyone escaping from jeʹhus sword eliʹsha will put to death
18  and i still have left 7000 in israel all whose knees have not bent down to baʹal and whose mouths have not kissed him
19  so he went from there and found eliʹsha the son of shaʹphat while he was plowing with 12 pairs of bulls ahead of him and he was with the 12th pair
so eliʹjah went over to him and threw his official garment on him
20  at that he left the bulls and ran after eliʹjah and said please let me kiss my father and my mother
then i will follow you
he replied to him go return for what have i done to stop you
21  so he went back and took a pair of bulls and sacrificed them and he used the plowing gear to boil the meat of the bulls and gave it to the people and they ate
after that he rose up and followed eliʹjah and began to minister to him
5  when hiʹram the king of tyre heard that solʹomon had been anointed as king in place of his father he sent his servants to solʹomon for hiʹram had always been a friend of davids
2  in turn solʹomon sent word to hiʹram
3  you well know that david my father was not able to build a house for the name of jehovah his god because of the wars waged against him from every side until jehovah put his enemies under the soles of his feet
4  but now jehovah my god has given me rest on all sides
there is no one opposing me and nothing bad happening
5  so i intend to build a house for the name of jehovah my god just as jehovah promised to david my father saying your son whom i will put on your throne in your place he is the one who will build the house for my name
6  now command your people to cut cedars of lebʹanon for me
my servants will work with your servants and i will pay the wages of your servants according to the rate you set for you are aware that not one of us knows how to cut trees like the sidoʹnians
7  when hiʹram heard solʹomons words he rejoiced greatly and said may jehovah be praised today for he has given david a wise son over this great people
8  so hiʹram sent word to solʹomon i have heard the message you sent to me
i will do all you desire in providing the cedar and juniper timbers
9  my servants will bring them down from lebʹanon to the sea and i will make them into log rafts to go by sea to the place that you designate to me
i will have them broken up there and you can carry them away
in exchange you will provide the food that i request for my household
10  so hiʹram supplied all the timbers of cedar and juniper that solʹomon desired
11  and solʹomon gave hiʹram 20000 cor measures of wheat as food supplies for his household and 20 cor measures of very fine olive oil
that was what solʹomon gave hiʹram year after year
12  and jehovah gave solʹomon wisdom just as he had promised him
and there was peace between hiʹram and solʹomon and the two of them made a treaty
13  king solʹomon conscripted men for forced labor out of all israel 30000 men were conscripted
14  he would send them to lebʹanon in shifts of 10000 each month
they would spend a month in lebʹanon and two months at their homes and adoniʹram was over those conscripted for forced labor
15  solʹomon had 70000 common laborers and 80000 stonecutters in the mountains
16  as well as solʹomons 3300 princely deputies who served as foremen to supervise the workmen
17  at the kings order they quarried large stones expensive stones to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones
18  so solʹomons builders and hiʹrams builders and the geʹbalites did the cutting and they prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house
15  in the 18th year of king jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat abiʹjam became king over judah
2  he reigned for three years in jerusalem
his mothers name was maʹacah the granddaughter of abishʹalom
3  he went on walking in all the sins that his father committed prior to him and his heart was not complete with jehovah his god like the heart of david his forefather
4  however on account of david jehovah his god gave him a lamp in jerusalem by raising up his son after him and keeping jerusalem in existence
5  for david did what was right in the eyes of jehovah and he did not turn aside from anything that he had commanded him all the days of his life except in the matter of uriʹah the hitʹtite
6  and there was warfare between rehoboʹam and jeroboʹam all the days of his life
7  as for the rest of the history of abiʹjam all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah there was also war between abiʹjam and jeroboʹam
8  then abiʹjam was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the city of david and his son aʹsa became king in his place
9  in the 20th year of king jeroboʹam of israel aʹsa began to reign over judah
10  he reigned in jerusalem for 41 years
his grandmothers name was maʹacah the granddaughter of abishʹalom
11  aʹsa did what was right in the eyes of jehovah like david his forefather
12  he expelled the male temple prostitutes from the land and removed all the disgusting idols that his forefathers had made
13  he even removed maʹacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole
aʹsa cut down her obscene idol and burned it in the kidʹron valley
14  but the high places were not removed
nevertheless aʹsas heart was complete with jehovah all his life
15  and he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of jehovahsilver gold and various utensils
16  there was constant warfare between aʹsa and baʹasha the king of israel
17  so king baʹasha of israel came up against judah and began to build up raʹmah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to king aʹsa of judah
18  at that aʹsa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasuries of the house of jehovah and the treasuries of the house of the king and handed them over to his servants
king aʹsa then sent them to benhaʹdad the son of tabrimʹmon the son of heʹzion the king of syria who was dwelling in damascus saying
19  there is a treaty between me and you and between my father and your father
i am sending you a gift of silver and gold
come break your treaty with king baʹasha of israel so that he will withdraw from me
20  benhaʹdad listened to king aʹsa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of israel and they struck down iʹjon dan aʹbelbethmaʹacah all chinʹnereth and all the land of naphʹtali
21  when baʹasha heard of it he immediately quit building raʹmah and continued dwelling in tirʹzah
22  king aʹsa then summoned all judahno one was exemptand they carried off the stones and timbers of raʹmah that baʹasha had been building with and with them king aʹsa built up geʹba in benjamin and mizʹpah
23  as for all the rest of the history of aʹsa all his mightiness and all that he did and the cities that he built is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah but in his old age he suffered from a disease in his feet
24  then aʹsa was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with them in the city of david his forefather and his son jehoshʹaphat became king in his place
25  naʹdab the son of jeroboʹam became king over israel in the second year of king aʹsa of judah and he reigned over israel for two years
26  he kept doing what was bad in the eyes of jehovah and walked in the way of his father and in his sin that he caused israel to commit
27  baʹasha the son of ahiʹjah of the house of isʹsachar conspired against him and baʹasha struck him down at gibʹbethon which belonged to the philisʹtines while naʹdab and all israel were besieging gibʹbethon
28  so baʹasha put him to death in the third year of king aʹsa of judah and became king in his place
29  and as soon as he became king he struck down all the house of jeroboʹam
he did not let remain anyone breathing who belonged to jeroboʹam he had them annihilated according to jehovahs word that he had spoken through his servant ahiʹjah the shiʹlonite
30  this was because of the sins that jeroboʹam had committed and had caused israel to commit and because he had greatly offended jehovah the god of israel
31  as for the rest of the history of naʹdab all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
32  and there was constant warfare between aʹsa and king baʹasha of israel
33  in the third year of king aʹsa of judah baʹasha the son of ahiʹjah became king in tirʹzah over all israel and reigned for 24 years
34  but he kept doing what was bad in the eyes of jehovah and he walked in the way of jeroboʹam and in his sin that he caused israel to commit
20  now king benhaʹdad of syria gathered his whole army together along with 32 other kings and their horses and chariots he went up and laid siege to samarʹia and fought against it
2  then he sent messengers to king aʹhab of israel at the city and said to him this is what benhaʹdad says
3  your silver and your gold are mine as well as the best of your wives and your sons
4  to this the king of israel answered according to your word my lord the king i am yours along with all that belongs to me
5  the messengers later came back and said this is what benhaʹdad says i sent this message to you your silver your gold your wives and your sons you will give me
6  but about this time tomorrow i will send my servants to you and they will carefully search your house and the houses of your servants and all your desirable things they will seize and take away
7  at that the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said take note please and see that this man is bent on bringing calamity for he demanded my wives my sons my silver and my gold and i did not refuse him
8  then all the elders and all the people said to him do not obey and do not consent
9  so he said to the messengers of benhaʹdad say to my lord the king all that you first demanded of your servant i will do but this i cannot do
with that the messengers went off and brought word back to him
10  benhaʹdad now sent him this message so may the gods do to me and add to it if there is enough dust in samarʹia to give each of the people following me a handful
11  the king of israel answered tell him the one who puts on his armor should not boast about himself like one who takes it off
12  as soon as he heard this reply while he and the kings were drinking in their tents he said to his servants get ready to attack so they got ready to attack the city
13  but a prophet approached king aʹhab of israel and said this is what jehovah says have you seen all this large crowd here i am giving it into your hand today and then you will know that i am jehovah
14  aʹhab asked by whom to which he said this is what jehovah says by the attendants of the princes of the provinces
so he asked who will start the battle to which he said you
15  aʹhab then counted the attendants of the princes of the provinces and they were 232 after that he counted all the israelite men 7000
16  they went out at noon while benhaʹdad was drinking himself drunk in the tents along with the 32 kings who were helping him
17  when the attendants of the princes of the provinces came out first benhaʹdad at once sent messengers
they reported to him men have come out from samarʹia
18  at that he said if they have come out for peace take them alive or if they have come out for battle you should still take them alive
19  but when these came out of the citythe attendants of the princes of the provinces and the armies that were following them
20  each one struck down his opponent
then the syrians fled and israel pursued them but king benhaʹdad of syria escaped on a horse with some of the horsemen
21  but the king of israel went out and kept striking down the horses and the chariots and he inflicted a great defeat on the syrians
22  later the prophet approached the king of israel and said to him go strengthen yourself and consider what you are going to do for at the start of the next year the king of syria will come up against you
23  now the servants of the king of syria said to him their god is a god of mountains
that is why they overpowered us
but if we fight against them on level land we will overpower them
24  also do this remove all the kings from their places and replace them with governors
25  then gather an army equal to the army you lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot
let us fight against them on level land and we will surely overpower them
so he listened to their advice and did just that
26  at the start of the year benhaʹdad mustered the syrians and went up to aʹphek for battle against israel
27  the people of israel were also mustered and supplied and they went out to meet them
when the people of israel camped in front of them they were like two tiny flocks of goats while the syrians filled the whole land
28  then the man of the true god approached the king of israel and said this is what jehovah says because the syrians have said jehovah is a god of mountains and he is not a god of plains i will give all this large crowd into your hand and you will certainly know that i am jehovah
29  they remained encamped opposite each other for seven days and on the seventh day the battle began
the people of israel struck down 100000 syrian foot soldiers in one day
30  and the rest fled to aʹphek into the city
but the wall fell down on 27000 of the men who were left
benhaʹdad also fled and came into the city and he hid in an inner room
31  so his servants said to him look we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings
please let us wear sackcloth on our hips and put ropes on our heads and go out to the king of israel
perhaps he will spare your life
32  so they wore sackcloth around their hips and ropes on their heads and came in to the king of israel and said your servant benhaʹdad says please let me live
he replied is he still alive he is my brother
33  the men took it as an omen and quickly took him at his word so they said benhaʹdad is your brother
at that he said go and get him
then benhaʹdad went out to him and he had him get up into the chariot
34  benhaʹdad now said to him the cities that my father took from your father i will return and you may establish markets for yourself in damascus just as my father did in samarʹia
aʹhab replied on the basis of this agreement i will let you go
with that he made an agreement with him and let him go
35  by the word of jehovah one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion strike me please
but the man refused to strike him
36  so he said to him because you did not listen to the voice of jehovah as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you
after he left him a lion came upon him and killed him
37  he found another man and said strike me please
so the man struck him and wounded him
38  then the prophet went and waited for the king by the road disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes
39  as the king was passing by he cried out to the king your servant went into the thick of the battle and there was a man coming out who brought a man to me and said guard this man
if he is found missing your life will have to take the place of his life or else you will pay a talent of silver
40  and while your servant was busy here and there suddenly the man was gone
the king of israel said to him so your own judgment will be you have decided it yourself
41  then he quickly removed the bandage from his eyes and the king of israel recognized that he was one of the prophets
42  he said to him this is what jehovah says because you have let the man whom i said should be destroyed escape from your hand your life must take the place of his life and your people the place of his people
43  at that the king of israel went home to samarʹia sullen and dejected
1  now king david was old advanced in years and although they would cover him with garments he could not get warm
2  so his servants said to him let a girl a virgin be found for my lord the king and she will wait on the king as his nurse
she will lie in your arms so that my lord the king may feel warm
3  they searched throughout all the territory of israel for a beautiful girl and they found abʹishag the shuʹnammite and brought her in to the king
4  the girl was extremely beautiful and she became the kings nurse and waited on him but the king did not have sexual relations with her
5  meanwhile adoniʹjah the son of hagʹgith was exalting himself saying i am going to be king he had a chariot made for himself with horsemen and 50 men to run before him
6  but his father had never confronted him by saying why have you done this he was also very handsome and his mother had given birth to him after abʹsalom
7  he conferred with joʹab the son of zeruʹiah and abiʹathar the priest and they offered adoniʹjah help and support
8  but zaʹdok the priest benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada nathan the prophet shimʹei reʹi and davids mighty warriors did not support adoniʹjah
9  eventually adoniʹjah held a sacrifice of sheep cattle and fattened animals by the stone of zoʹheleth which is near enroʹgel and he invited all his brothers the kings sons and all the men of judah the kings servants
10  but he did not invite nathan the prophet benaiʹah and the mighty warriors or solʹomon his brother
11  nathan then said to bathsheʹba solʹomons mother have you not heard that adoniʹjah the son of hagʹgith has become king and our lord david does not know anything about it
12  so now come please and let me advise you so that you may save your own life and the life of your son solʹomon
13  go in to king david and say to him was it not you my lord the king who swore to your servant saying your son solʹomon will become king after me and he is the one who will sit on my throne so why has adoniʹjah become king
14  while you are still there speaking with the king i will come in after you and confirm your words
15  so bathsheʹba went in to the king into his private room
the king was very old and abʹishag the shuʹnammite was waiting on the king
16  then bathsheʹba bowed low and prostrated herself to the king and the king said what is your request
17  she replied my lord it was you who swore by jehovah your god to your servant your son solʹomon will become king after me and he is the one who will sit on my throne
18  but look adoniʹjah has become king and my lord the king does not know anything about it
19  he sacrificed bulls fattened animals and sheep in great quantity and invited all the sons of the king and abiʹathar the priest and joʹab the chief of the army but he did not invite your servant solʹomon
20  and now my lord the king the eyes of all israel are upon you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
21  otherwise as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his forefathers i and also my son solʹomon will be considered traitors
22  and while she was still speaking to the king nathan the prophet came in
23  at once the king was told here is nathan the prophet he came in before the king and prostrated himself to the king with his face to the ground
24  then nathan said my lord the king did you say adoniʹjah will become king after me and he is the one who will sit on my throne
25  for today he has gone down to sacrifice bulls fattened animals and sheep in great quantity and he has invited all the sons of the king and the chiefs of the army and abiʹathar the priest
they are there eating and drinking with him and they keep saying long live king adoniʹjah
26  but he did not invite me your servant or zaʹdok the priest or benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada or your servant solʹomon
27  has my lord the king authorized this without telling your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
28  king david now answered call bathsheʹba for me
at that she came in and stood before the king
29  the king then swore an oath as surely as jehovah is living the one who rescued me out of all distress
30  just as i swore to you by jehovah the god of israel saying your son solʹomon will become king after me and he is the one who will sit on my throne in my place that is what i will bring about this day
31  then bathsheʹba bowed low with her face to the ground and prostrated herself to the king and said may my lord king david live forever
32  immediately king david said call for me zaʹdok the priest nathan the prophet and benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada
so they came in before the king
33  the king said to them take with you the servants of your lord and have my son solʹomon ride on my own mule and lead him down to giʹhon
34  zaʹdok the priest and nathan the prophet will anoint him there as king over israel then blow the horn and say long live king solʹomon
35  then follow him back and he will come in and sit on my throne and he will be king in my place and i will commission him as leader over israel and over judah
36  at once benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada said to the king amen may jehovah the god of my lord the king confirm it
37  just as jehovah was with my lord the king so let him be with solʹomon and may he make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david
38  then zaʹdok the priest nathan the prophet benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada and the cherʹethites and the pelʹethites went down and had solʹomon ride on the mule of king david and they brought him to giʹhon
39  zaʹdok the priest now took the horn of oil out of the tent and anointed solʹomon and they began to blow the horn and all the people began shouting long live king solʹomon
40  after that all the people followed him and went up playing flutes and rejoicing greatly so that the earth was split open by their noise
41  adoniʹjah and all those invited by him heard it when they had finished eating
as soon as joʹab heard the sound of the horn he said why is there such a noisy uproar in the city
42  while he was still speaking jonʹathan the son of abiʹathar the priest came
then adoniʹjah said come in for you are a good man and you must bring good news
43  but jonʹathan answered adoniʹjah no our lord king david has made solʹomon king
44  the king sent with him zaʹdok the priest nathan the prophet benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada and the cherʹethites and the pelʹethites and they had him ride on the mule of the king
45  then zaʹdok the priest and nathan the prophet anointed him as king in giʹhon
after that they came up from there rejoicing and the city is in an uproar
that was the noise that you heard
46  moreover solʹomon has sat down on the royal throne
47  another thing the servants of the king have come in to congratulate our lord king david saying may your god make solʹomons name more splendid than your name and may he make his throne greater than your throne at that the king bowed down on the bed
48  and the king also said may jehovah the god of israel be praised who today has granted someone to sit on my throne and has allowed my own eyes to see it
49  and all those invited by adoniʹjah became terrified and each of them rose up and went his own way
50  adoniʹjah was also afraid because of solʹomon so he got up and went and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar
51  the report was made to solʹomon here adoniʹjah has become afraid of king solʹomon and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar saying let king solʹomon first swear to me that he will not put his servant to death by the sword
52  to this solʹomon said if he behaves in a worthy manner not a single hair of his will fall to the ground but if what is bad is found in him he will have to die
53  so king solʹomon sent for him to be brought down from the altar
then he came in and bowed down to king solʹomon after which solʹomon said to him go to your own house
2  when the time of davids death drew near he gave his son solʹomon these instructions
2  i am about to die
therefore be strong and prove yourself a man
3  you must keep your obligation to jehovah your god by walking in his ways and by observing his statutes his commandments his judgments and his reminders as they are written in the law of moses then you will succeed in everything you do and everywhere you turn
4  and jehovah will carry out his promise that he made concerning me if your sons pay attention to their way by walking faithfully before me with all their heart and soul there will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of israel
5  you also well know what joʹab the son of zeruʹiah did to me what he did to two chiefs of the armies of israelabʹner the son of ner and amaʹsa the son of jeʹther
he killed them shedding the blood of war in peacetime and he put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet
6  you must act according to your wisdom and not let his gray hairs go down in peace to the grave
7  but toward the sons of barzilʹlai the gilʹeadite you should show loyal love and they should be among those eating at your table for that was how they stood by me when i ran away from your brother abʹsalom
8  there is also with you shimʹei the son of geʹra the benʹjaminite from bahuʹrim
he was the one who cursed me with a vicious curse on the day that i was going to mahanaʹim but when he came down to meet me at the jordan i swore to him by jehovah i will not put you to death by the sword
9  now do not leave him unpunished for you are a wise man and you know what you should do to him you must bring his gray hairs down to the grave with blood
10  then david was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the city of david
11  the length of davids reign over israel was 40 years
in hebʹron he reigned for 7 years and in jerusalem he reigned for 33 years
12  solʹomon then sat down on the throne of david his father and gradually his kingship became firmly established
13  in time adoniʹjah the son of hagʹgith came to bathsheʹba solʹomons mother
she asked is your coming peaceable he replied it is peaceable
14  he then said i have something to say to you
so she said speak
15  he continued you well know that the kingship was to become mine and all israel expected me to become king but the kingship eluded me and became my brothers for it was from jehovah that it became his
16  but now there is just one request that i am making of you
do not turn me away
so she said to him speak
17  he then said please ask solʹomon the kingfor he will not turn you awayto give me abʹishag the shuʹnammite as a wife
18  to this bathsheʹba said very well i will speak for you to the king
19  so bathsheʹba went in to king solʹomon to speak to him for adoniʹjah
at once the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her
then he sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the kings mother so that she could sit at his right
20  she then said there is one small request that i am making of you
do not turn me away
so the king said to her make it my mother for i will not turn you away
21  she said let abʹishag the shuʹnammite be given as a wife to your brother adoniʹjah
22  at this king solʹomon answered his mother why are you requesting abʹishag the shuʹnammite for adoniʹjah you may as well request the kingship for him for he is my older brother and supporting him are abiʹathar the priest and joʹab the son of zeruʹiah
23  with that king solʹomon swore by jehovah so may god do to me and add to it if it was not at the cost of his own life that adoniʹjah made this request
24  and now as surely as jehovah is living who has firmly established me and seated me on the throne of david my father and who made a house for me just as he promised adoniʹjah will be put to death today
25  king solʹomon immediately sent benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada who went out and struck adoniʹjah down and he died
26  to abiʹathar the priest the king said go to your fields in anʹathoth you deserve to die but on this day i will not put you to death because you carried the ark of the sovereign lord jehovah before david my father and because you shared in all the hardships that my father suffered
27  so solʹomon drove abiʹathar out from serving as a priest of jehovah to fulfill jehovahs word against the house of eʹli in shiʹloh
28  when the news reached joʹabfor joʹab had supported adoniʹjah but he had not supported abʹsalomjoʹab fled to the tent of jehovah and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar
29  then king solʹomon was told joʹab has fled to the tent of jehovah and he is there beside the altar
so solʹomon sent benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada saying go strike him down
30  so benaiʹah went to the tent of jehovah and said to him this is what the king says come out but he said no i will die here
benaiʹah brought word back to the king this is what joʹab said and this is what he answered me
31  then the king said to him do just as he said strike him down and bury him and remove from me and from the house of my father the blood that joʹab spilled without just cause
32  jehovah will bring his blood back on his own head for without my father davids knowledge he struck down and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than he was abʹner the son of ner the chief of the army of israel and amaʹsa the son of jeʹther the chief of the army of judah
33  their blood will come back on the head of joʹab and on the head of his offspring forever but for david his offspring his house and his throne may there be peace from jehovah forever
34  then benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada went up and struck joʹab down and put him to death and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness
35  then the king appointed benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada over the army in his place and the king appointed zaʹdok the priest in place of abiʹathar
36  then the king summoned shimʹei and said to him build yourself a house in jerusalem and live there do not go out from there to any other place
37  on the day you go out and cross the kidʹron valley you can be sure that you will die
your blood will be on your own head
38  shimʹei replied to the king what you have said is fair
your servant will do just as my lord the king has said
so shimʹei stayed in jerusalem for many days
39  but at the end of three years two of shimʹeis slaves ran away to aʹchish the son of maʹacah the king of gath
when shimʹei was told look your slaves are in gath
40  shimʹei immediately saddled his donkey and went to see aʹchish in gath to find his slaves
when shimʹei returned from gath with his slaves
41  solʹomon was told shimʹei has gone out of jerusalem to gath and has returned
42  at that the king summoned shimʹei and said to him did i not put you under oath by jehovah and warn you on the day you go out from here to any other place you can be sure that you will die and did you not say to me what you are saying is fair i will obey
43  why then did you not keep the oath of jehovah and the commandment that i imposed on you
44  the king then said to shimʹei you know in your heart all the injury that you did to david my father and jehovah will bring back that injury on your own head
45  but king solʹomon will be blessed and the throne of david will be firmly established before jehovah forever
46  with that the king commanded benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada who went out and struck him down and he died
thus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of solʹomon
3  solʹomon made a marriage alliance with pharʹaoh king of egypt
he married pharʹaohs daughter and brought her to the city of david until he finished building his own house and the house of jehovah and the wall around jerusalem
2  but the people were still sacrificing on the high places because until that time a house for the name of jehovah had not yet been built
3  solʹomon continued to love jehovah by walking in the statutes of david his father except that he was sacrificing and making offerings smoke on the high places
4  the king went to gibʹeon to sacrifice there for that was the most prominent high place
solʹomon offered 1000 burnt sacrifices on that altar
5  in gibʹeon jehovah appeared to solʹomon in a dream by night and god said ask what you would like me to give you
6  at this solʹomon said you have shown great loyal love toward your servant david my father as he walked before you in faithfulness and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart
you have continued to show him this great loyal love down to this day by giving him a son to sit on his throne
7  and now jehovah my god you have made your servant king in the place of david my father though i am just a youth and i am inexperienced
8  your servant is among your people whom you have chosen a people so vast that they cannot be numbered or counted
9  so grant your servant an obedient heart to judge your people to discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this numerous people of yours
10  it was pleasing to jehovah that solʹomon had requested this
11  god then said to him because you requested this and you did not request for yourself long life or riches or the death of your enemies but you requested understanding to hear judicial cases
12  i will do what you asked
i will give you a wise and understanding heart so that just as there has never been anyone like you before there will never be anyone like you again
13  furthermore what you have not requested i will give you both riches and glory so that there will be no other king like you in your lifetime
14  and if you walk in my ways by keeping my regulations and my commandments just as david your father walked i will also give you a long life
15  when solʹomon awoke he realized that it had been a dream
then he went to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion offerings and spread a feast for all his servants
16  at that time two prostitutes came in to the king and stood before him
17  the first woman said please my lord this woman and i live in one house and i gave birth while she was in the house
18  on the third day after i gave birth this woman also gave birth
we were together just the two of us there was no one else with us in the house
19  during the night this womans son died because she lay on him
20  so she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your slave girl was asleep and laid him in her arms and she laid her dead son in my arms
21  when i got up in the morning to nurse my son i saw that he was dead
so i examined him closely in the morning and saw that it was not my son whom i had given birth to
22  but the other woman said no my son is the living one and your son is the dead one but the first woman was saying no your son is the dead one and my son is the living one
that is how they argued before the king
23  finally the king said this one says this is my son the living one and your son is the dead one and that one says no your son is the dead one and my son is the living one
24  the king said bring me a sword
so they brought a sword to the king
25  the king then said cut the living child in two and give half to one woman and half to the other
26  at once the woman whose son was the living one pleaded with the king for her compassions were stirred toward her son
she said please my lord you should give her the living child by no means put him to death but the other woman was saying he will be neither mine nor yours let them cut him in two
27  at that the king answered give the living child to the first woman by no means put him to death for she is his mother
28  so all israel heard about the judgment that the king had handed down and they were in awe of the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was with him to execute justice
12  rehoboʹam went to sheʹchem for all israel had come to sheʹchem to make him king
2  as soon as jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat heard of it he was still in egypt because he had run off on account of king solʹomon and was living in egypt
3  they sent for him
after that jeroboʹam and all the congregation of israel came to rehoboʹam and said
4  your father made our yoke harsh
but if you make the harsh service of your father easier and you lighten the heavy yoke he put on us we will serve you
5  at this he said to them go away for three days then return to me
so the people went away
6  king rehoboʹam then consulted with the older men who had served his father solʹomon while he was alive saying what advice would you give on how to reply to this people
7  they answered him if today you would become a servant to this people and submit to their request and give them a favorable answer they will always be your servants
8  however he rejected the advice that the older men gave him and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his attendants
9  he asked them what advice do you offer on how we should reply to this people who have said to me make the yoke your father put on us lighter
10  the young men who had grown up with him said to him this is what you should say to this people who have said to you your father made our yoke heavy but you should make it lighter for us this is what you should tell them my little finger will be thicker than my fathers hips
11  my father imposed a heavy yoke on you but i will add to your yoke
my father punished you with whips but i will punish you with scourges
12  jeroboʹam and all the people came to rehoboʹam on the third day just as the king had said return to me on the third day
13  but the king answered the people harshly rejecting the advice that the older men had given him
14  he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add to your yoke
my father punished you with whips but i will punish you with scourges
15  so the king did not listen to the people for this turn of events was caused by jehovah in order to carry out the word that jehovah had spoken through ahiʹjah the shiʹlonite to jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat
16  when all israel saw that the king refused to listen to them the people replied to the king what share do we have in david we have no inheritance in the son of jesʹse
to your gods o israel
now look after your own house o david with that israel returned to their homes
17  but rehoboʹam continued to reign over the israelites living in the cities of judah
18  then king rehoboʹam sent adoʹram who was in charge of those conscripted for forced labor but all israel stoned him to death
king rehoboʹam managed to mount his chariot to flee to jerusalem
19  and the israelites have been in revolt against the house of david down to this day
20  as soon as all israel heard that jeroboʹam had returned they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all israel
none of the people followed the house of david except the tribe of judah
21  when rehoboʹam arrived in jerusalem he immediately congregated all the house of judah and the tribe of benjamin 180000 trained warriors to fight against the house of israel in order to restore the kingship to rehoboʹam the son of solʹomon
22  then the word of the true god came to shemaiʹah the man of the true god saying
23  say to rehoboʹam the son of solʹomon the king of judah and to all the house of judah and benjamin and the rest of the people
24  this is what jehovah says you must not go up and fight against your israelite brothers
each one of you must return to his house for i have caused this to happen
so they obeyed the word of jehovah and went back home as jehovah had told them
25  jeroboʹam then built up sheʹchem in the mountainous region of eʹphraim and lived there
from there he went out and built up penuʹel
26  jeroboʹam said in his heart now the kingdom will return to the house of david
27  if this people continues to go up to offer sacrifices at the house of jehovah in jerusalem the heart of this people will also return to their lord king rehoboʹam of judah
yes they will kill me and return to king rehoboʹam of judah
28  after consultation the king made two golden calves and said to the people it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem
here is your god o israel who brought you up out of the land of egypt
29  then he placed one in bethʹel and the other he put in dan
30  and this caused them to sin and the people went as far as dan to worship the one there
31  and he made houses of worship on the high places and appointed priests from the people in general those who were not levites
32  jeroboʹam also established a festival in the eighth month on the 15th day of the month like the festival in judah
on the altar that he made at bethʹel he sacrificed to the calves he had made and at bethʹel he assigned priests for the high places that he had made
33  and he began to make offerings on the altar that he had made at bethʹel on the 15th day in the eighth month in the month that he had devised on his own and he established a festival for the people of israel and he ascended the altar to make offerings and sacrificial smoke
