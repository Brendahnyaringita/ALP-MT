1  in the second year of king dariʹus in the sixth month on the first day of the month the word of jehovah came through hagʹgai the prophet to zerubʹbabel son of shealʹtiel the governor of judah and to joshua son of jehozʹadak the high priest saying
2  this is what jehovah of armies says these people say the time has not yet come for the house of jehovah to be built
3  and the word of jehovah again came through hagʹgai the prophet saying
4  is it the time for you to dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies in ruins
5  now this is what jehovah of armies says set your heart on your ways
6  you have sown much seed but you harvest little
you eat but it is not to satisfaction
you drink but you do not drink your fill
you put on clothing but no one gets warm
the one who hires himself out puts his wages in a bag full of holes
7  this is what jehovah of armies says set your heart on your ways
8  go up to the mountain and bring in lumber
and build the house so that i may take pleasure in it and i may be glorified jehovah says
9  you were expecting much and receiving little and when you brought it into the house i blew it away
for what reason declares jehovah of armies
because my house is in ruins while each of you runs around taking care of his own house
10  so the heavens above you withheld their dew and the earth withheld its produce
11  and i kept calling for a drought on the earth on the mountains on the grain on the new wine on the oil on what grows from the ground on humans and livestock and on all the labor of your hands
12  zerubʹbabel son of shealʹtiel and joshua son of jehozʹadak the high priest and all the rest of the people listened to the voice of jehovah their god and to the words of hagʹgai the prophet because jehovah their god had sent him and the people began to show fear because of jehovah
13  then hagʹgai the messenger of jehovah gave this message to the people in harmony with his commission from jehovah i am with you people declares jehovah
14  so jehovah stirred up the spirit of zerubʹbabel the son of shealʹtiel the governor of judah and the spirit of joshua the son of jehozʹadak the high priest and the spirit of all the rest of the people and they came and began to work on the house of jehovah of armies their god
15  this was on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year of king dariʹus
2  in the seventh month on the 21st day of the month the word of jehovah came through hagʹgai the prophet saying
2  please ask zerubʹbabel son of shealʹtiel the governor of judah and joshua son of jehozʹadak the high priest and the rest of the people
3  who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory how does it look to you now does it not seem like nothing in comparison
4  but now be strong zerubʹbabel declares jehovah and be strong joshua son of jehozʹadak the high priest
and be strong all you people of the land declares jehovah and work
for i am with you declares jehovah of armies
5  remember what i promised you when you came out of egypt and my spirit remains among you
do not be afraid
6  for this is what jehovah of armies says yet once morein a little whileand i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land
7  and i will shake all the nations and the precious things of all the nations will come in and i will fill this house with glory says jehovah of armies
8  the silver is mine and the gold is mine declares jehovah of armies
9  the future glory of this house will be greater than the former says jehovah of armies
and in this place i will grant peace declares jehovah of armies
10  on the 24th day of the ninth month in the second year of dariʹus the word of jehovah came to hagʹgai the prophet saying
11  this is what jehovah of armies says ask please the priests about the law
12  if a man carries holy flesh in the fold of his clothing and his clothing touches bread or stew or wine or oil or any sort of food will it become holy the priests answered no
13  hagʹgai then asked if someone who is unclean from contact with a dead body touches any of these things will it become unclean the priests answered it will become unclean
14  so hagʹgai said that is how this people is and that is how this nation is before me declares jehovah and that is how all the work of their hands is whatever they present there is unclean
15  but now please set your heart on this from this day forward before a stone was placed on a stone in the temple of jehovah
16  how was it then when someone came to a heap of grain expecting 20 measures there were only 10 and when someone came to the vat to draw 50 measures from the wine trough there were only 20
17  i struck youall the works of your handswith scorching blight and mildew and hail but not one of you turned to me declares jehovah
18  please set your heart on this from this day forward from the 24th day of the ninth month from the day that the foundation of the temple of jehovah was laid set your heart on this
19  is there seed yet in the storehouse the vine the fig the pomegranate and the olive treethey have not yet borne fruit have they from this day i will send a blessing
20  the word of jehovah came a second time to hagʹgai on the 24th day of the month saying
21  say to zerubʹbabel the governor of judah i am going to shake the heavens and the earth
22  i will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and annihilate the strength of the kingdoms of the nations and i will overthrow the chariot and its riders and the horses and their riders will fall each one by the sword of his brother
23  in that day declares jehovah of armies i will take you my servant zerubʹbabel son of shealʹtiel declares jehovah and i will make you like a seal ring because you are the one whom i have chosen declares jehovah of armies
