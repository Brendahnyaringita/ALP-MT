4  beloved ones do not believe every inspired statement but test the inspired statements to see whether they originate with god for many false prophets have gone out into the world
2  this is how you know that the inspired statement is from god every inspired statement that acknowledges jesus christ as having come in the flesh originates with god
3  but every inspired statement that does not acknowledge jesus does not originate with god
furthermore this is the antichrists inspired statement that you have heard was coming and now it is already in the world
4  you originate with god little children and you have conquered them because the one who is in union with you is greater than the one who is in union with the world
5  they originate with the world that is why they speak what originates with the world and the world listens to them
6  we originate with god
whoever comes to know god listens to us whoever does not originate with god does not listen to us
by this we distinguish the inspired statement of truth from the inspired statement of error
7  beloved ones let us continue loving one another because love is from god and everyone who loves has been born from god and knows god
8  whoever does not love has not come to know god because god is love
9  by this the love of god was revealed in our case that god sent his onlybegotten son into the world so that we might gain life through him
10  the love is in this respect not that we have loved god but that he loved us and sent his son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins
11  beloved ones if this is how god loved us then we are also under obligation to love one another
12  no one has seen god at any time
if we continue loving one another god remains in us and his love is made perfect in us
13  by this we know that we are remaining in union with him and he in union with us because he has given his spirit to us
14  in addition we ourselves have seen and are bearing witness that the father has sent his son as savior of the world
15  whoever acknowledges that jesus is gods son god remains in union with such one and he in union with god
16  and we have come to know and believe the love that god has for us
god is love and the one who remains in love remains in union with god and god remains in union with him
17  in this way love has been made perfect in us so that we may have freeness of speech in the day of judgment because just as that one is so are we ourselves in this world
18  there is no fear in love but perfect love casts fear out because fear restrains us
indeed the one who is fearful has not been made perfect in love
19  we love because he first loved us
20  if anyone says i love god and yet is hating his brother he is a liar
for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love god whom he has not seen
21  and we have this commandment from him that whoever loves god must also love his brother
5  everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has been born from god and everyone who loves the one who caused to be born loves him who has been born from that one
2  by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and carry out his commandments
3  for this is what the love of god means that we observe his commandments and yet his commandments are not burdensome
4  because everyone who has been born from god conquers the world
and this is the conquest that has conquered the world our faith
5  who can conquer the world is it not the one who has faith that jesus is the son of god
6  this is the one who came by means of water and blood jesus christ not with the water only but with the water and with the blood
and the spirit is bearing witness because the spirit is the truth
7  for there are three witness bearers
8  the spirit and the water and the blood and the three are in agreement
9  if we accept the witness of men the witness of god is greater
because this is the witness god gives the witness that he has given about his son
10  the person putting his faith in the son of god has the witness within himself
the person not having faith in god has made him a liar because he has not put his faith in the witness given by god concerning his son
11  and this is the witness that god gave us everlasting life and this life is in his son
12  the one who has the son has this life the one who does not have the son of god does not have this life
13  i write you these things so that you may know that you have life everlasting you who put your faith in the name of the son of god
14  and this is the confidence that we have toward him that no matter what we ask according to his will he hears us
15  and if we know that he hears us concerning whatever we are asking we know that we are to have the things we ask for since we have asked them of him
16  if anyone catches sight of his brother committing a sin that does not incur death he will ask and god will give life to him yes to those not committing sin that incurs death
there is a sin that does incur death
it is concerning that sin that i do not tell him to make request
17  all unrighteousness is sin and yet there is a sin that does not incur death
18  we know that everyone who has been born from god does not practice sin but the one born from god watches him and the wicked one cannot take hold of him
19  we know that we originate with god but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one
20  but we know that the son of god has come and he has given us insight so that we may gain the knowledge of the one who is true
and we are in union with the one who is true by means of his son jesus christ
this is the true god and life everlasting
21  little children guard yourselves from idols
1  that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have observed and our hands have felt concerning the word of life
2  yes the life was made manifest and we have seen and are bearing witness and reporting to you the everlasting life that was with the father and was made manifest to us
3  that which we have seen and heard we are reporting also to you so that you too may have fellowship with us
and this fellowship of ours is with the father and with his son jesus christ
4  and we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete
5  this is the message that we heard from him and are announcing to you god is light and there is no darkness at all in him
6  if we make the statement we are having fellowship with him and yet we go on walking in the darkness we are lying and are not practicing the truth
7  however if we are walking in the light as he himself is in the light we do have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin
8  if we make the statement we have no sin we are misleading ourselves and the truth is not in us
9  if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
10  if we make the statement we have not sinned we are making him a liar and his word is not in us
2  my little children i am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin
and yet if anyone does commit a sin we have a helper with the father jesus christ a righteous one
2  and he is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins yet not for ours only but also for the whole worlds
3  and by this we realize that we have come to know him namely if we continue observing his commandments
4  the one who says i have come to know him and yet does not observe his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in this person
5  but whoever does observe his word in this person the love of god has truly been made perfect
by this we know that we are in union with him
6  the one who says he remains in union with him is himself under obligation to go on walking just as that one walked
7  beloved ones i am writing you not a new commandment but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning
this old commandment is the word that you heard
8  again i am writing you a new commandment which is true in his case and in yours because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining
9  the one who says that he is in the light and yet hates his brother is still in the darkness
10  the one who loves his brother remains in the light and in him there is no cause for stumbling
11  but the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and is walking in the darkness and he does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes
12  i am writing you little children because your sins have been forgiven you for the sake of his name
13  i am writing you fathers because you have come to know him who is from the beginning
i am writing you young men because you have conquered the wicked one
i write you young children because you have come to know the father
14  i write you fathers because you have come to know him who is from the beginning
i write you young men because you are strong and the word of god remains in you and you have conquered the wicked one
15  do not love either the world or the things in the world
if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him
16  because everything in the worldthe desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of ones means of lifedoes not originate with the father but originates with the world
17  furthermore the world is passing away and so is its desire but the one who does the will of god remains forever
18  young children it is the last hour and just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have appeared from which fact we know that it is the last hour
19  they went out from us but they were not of our sort for if they had been of our sort they would have remained with us
but they went out so that it might be shown that not all are of our sort
20  and you have an anointing from the holy one and all of you have knowledge
21  i write you not because you do not know the truth but because you know it and because no lie originates with the truth
22  who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son
23  everyone who denies the son does not have the father either
but whoever acknowledges the son has the father also
24  as for you what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you
if what you have heard from the beginning remains in you you will also remain in union with the son and in union with the father
25  furthermore this is what he himself promised usthe life everlasting
26  i write you these things about those who are trying to mislead you
27  and as for you the anointing that you received from him remains in you and you do not need anyone to be teaching you but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things and is true and is no lie
just as it has taught you remain in union with him
28  so now little children remain in union with him so that when he is made manifest we may have freeness of speech and not shrink away from him in shame at his presence
29  if you know that he is righteous you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born from him
3  see what sort of love the father has given us that we should be called children of god and that is what we are
that is why the world does not know us because it has not come to know him
2  beloved ones we are now children of god but it has not yet been made manifest what we will be
we do know that when he is made manifest we will be like him because we will see him just as he is
3  and everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as that one is pure
4  everyone who practices sin is also practicing lawlessness and sin is lawlessness
5  you know too that he was made manifest to take away our sins and there is no sin in him
6  everyone remaining in union with him does not practice sin no one who practices sin has either seen him or come to know him
7  little children let no one mislead you the one who practices righteousness is righteous just as that one is righteous
8  the one who practices sin originates with the devil because the devil has been sinning from the beginning
for this purpose the son of god was made manifest to break up the works of the devil
9  everyone who has been born from god does not practice sin for his seed remains in such one and he cannot practice sin for he has been born from god
10  the children of god and the children of the devil are evident by this fact whoever does not practice righteousness does not originate with god nor does the one who does not love his brother
11  for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another
12  not like cain who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother
and for what reason did he slaughter him because his own works were wicked but those of his brother were righteous
13  do not be surprised brothers that the world hates you
14  we know that we have passed over from death to life because we love the brothers
the one who does not love remains in death
15  everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him
16  by this we have come to know love because that one surrendered his life for us and we are under obligation to surrender our lives for our brothers
17  but whoever has the material possessions of this world and sees his brother in need and yet refuses to show him compassion in what way does the love of god remain in him
18  little children we should love not in word or with the tongue but in deed and truth
19  by this we will know that we originate with the truth and we will assure our hearts before him
20  regarding whatever our hearts may condemn us in because god is greater than our hearts and knows all things
21  beloved ones if our hearts do not condemn us we have freeness of speech toward god
22  and whatever we ask we receive from him because we are observing his commandments and doing what is pleasing in his eyes
23  indeed this is his commandment that we have faith in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another just as he gave us a commandment
24  moreover the one who observes his commandments remains in union with him and he in union with such one
and by the spirit that he gave us we know that he remains in union with us
