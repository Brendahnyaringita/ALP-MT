1  the vision of obadiʹah this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says regarding eʹdom we have heard a report from jehovahan envoy has been sent among the nations rise up let us prepare for battle against her
2  look i have made you insignificant among the nationsyou are utterly despised
3  the presumptuousness of your heart has deceived youyou who reside in the retreats of the cragdwelling in the height saying in your heartwho will bring me down to the earth
4  even if you make your dwelling high like the eagleor if you place your nest among the starsi would bring you down from there declares jehovah
5  if thieves would come to you robbers by nighthow utterly you will be destroyed would they not steal only what they wanted or if it were grape gatherers who would come to youwould they not leave some gleanings behind
6  o how eʹsau has been searched out how his hidden treasures have been sought after
7  they have driven you to the border
all your allies have deceived you
the men at peace with you have prevailed against you
those eating bread with you will place a net under youbut you will not discern it
8  in that day declares jehovahwill i not destroy the wise ones out of eʹdomand discernment out of the mountainous region of eʹsau
9  and your warriors will become terrified o teʹmanbecause each one in the mountainous region of eʹsau will be destroyed in the slaughter
10  because of the violence done to your brother jacobshame will cover youand you will perish forever
11  on the day when you stood off to the sideon the day when strangers took his army into captivitywhen foreigners entered his gate and cast lots over jerusalemyou acted like one of them
12  you should not gloat over your brothers day on the day of his misfortuneyou should not rejoice over the people of judah on the day of their perishingand you should not speak so arrogantly on the day of their distress
13  you should not come into the gate of my people in the day of their disasteryou should not gloat over his calamity in the day of his disasterand you should not lay your hands on his wealth in the day of his disaster
14  you should not stand at the crossroads to slaughter his escapeesand you should not hand over his survivors in the day of distress
15  for the day of jehovah against all the nations is near
as you have done so it will be done to you
the way you treated others will come back on your own head
16  for in the way that you have drunk on my holy mountainall the nations will keep drinking constantly
they will drink and gulp downand they will be as though they had never existed
17  but on mount zion will be those who escapeand it will be holyand the house of jacob will take possession of the things belonging to them
18  the house of jacob will become a firethe house of joseph a flameand the house of eʹsau like stubblethey will set them ablaze and consume themand there will be no survivor of the house of eʹsaufor jehovah himself has spoken
19  they will take possession of the negʹeb and the mountainous region of eʹsauof the shepheʹlah and the land of the philisʹtines
they will take possession of the field of eʹphraim and the field of samarʹiaand benjamin will take possession of gilʹead
20  to the exiles of this rampartto the people of israel will belong the land of the caʹnaanites as far as zarʹephath
and the exiles of jerusalem who were in sepharʹad will possess the cities of the negʹeb
21  and saviors will go up on mount zionto judge the mountainous region of eʹsauand the kingship will become jehovahs
