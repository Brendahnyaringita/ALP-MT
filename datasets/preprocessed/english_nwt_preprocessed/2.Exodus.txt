10  then jehovah said to moses go in to pharʹaoh for i have allowed his heart and the hearts of his servants to become unresponsive so that i may display these signs of mine right before him
2  and in order that you may declare to your sons and your grandsons how severely i have dealt with egypt and what signs i have performed among them and you will certainly know that i am jehovah
3  so moses and aaron went in to pharʹaoh and said to him this is what jehovah the god of the hebrews has said how long will you refuse to submit to me send my people away so that they may serve me
4  for if you keep refusing to send my people away here i am bringing locusts within your boundaries tomorrow
5  and they will cover the surface of the earth and it will not be possible to see the ground
they will eat up what escaped the hail and was left for you and they will eat all your trees that are growing in the field
6  they will fill your houses the houses of all your servants and the houses of all egypt to an extent that your fathers and your grandfathers never saw from the time they have been in this land until today
with that he turned and went out from pharʹaoh
7  then pharʹaohs servants said to him how long will this man continue to menace us send the men away so that they may serve jehovah their god
do you not yet realize that egypt has been ruined
8  so moses and aaron were brought back to pharʹaoh and he said to them go serve jehovah your god
but just who will be going
9  then moses said we will go with our young people our old people our sons our daughters our sheep and our cattle because we will hold a festival to jehovah
10  he said to them if i ever send you and your children away then jehovah is indeed with you it is clear that you intend to do something evil
11  no only your men may go and serve jehovah for that is what you requested
with that they were driven out from before pharʹaoh
12  jehovah now said to moses stretch out your hand over the land of egypt for the locusts so that they may come up over the land of egypt and eat up all the vegetation of the land everything that the hail has let remain
13  at once moses stretched out his rod over the land of egypt and jehovah caused an east wind to blow on the land all that day and all night
the morning came and the east wind brought the locusts
14  and the locusts came up over all the land of egypt and settled down on the whole territory of egypt
it was extremely severe never before had there been so many locusts nor would there ever be so many again
15  they covered the surface of the entire land and the land grew dark with them they devoured all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left nothing green was left on the trees or on the vegetation of the field in all the land of egypt
16  so pharʹaoh quickly called moses and aaron and said i have sinned against jehovah your god and against you
17  now please pardon my sin just this once and plead with jehovah your god that he just remove this deadly plague from upon me
18  so he went out from pharʹaoh and pleaded with jehovah
19  then jehovah caused the wind to shift and it became a very stiff west wind and it carried the locusts away and drove them into the red sea
not a single locust remained in all the territory of egypt
20  however jehovah allowed pharʹaohs heart to become obstinate and he did not send the israelites away
21  jehovah then said to moses stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over the land of egypt a darkness so thick that it can be felt
22  moses immediately stretched out his hand toward the heavens and there was a dense darkness in all the land of egypt for three days
23  they did not see one another and none of them got up from where they were for three days but all the israelites had light in their dwellings
24  pharʹaoh then called moses and said go serve jehovah
only your sheep and your cattle will remain behind
even your children may go with you
25  but moses said you yourself will also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings and we will offer them to jehovah our god
26  our livestock will also go with us
not an animal will be allowed to remain because we will be using some of them to worship jehovah our god and we do not know what we will offer in worship to jehovah until we arrive there
27  so jehovah allowed pharʹaohs heart to become obstinate and he did not consent to send them away
28  pharʹaoh said to him get out of my sight make sure that you do not try to see my face again for on the day you see my face you will die
29  to this moses said just as you have spoken i will not try to see your face again
4  however moses answered but suppose they do not believe me and do not listen to my voice for they will say jehovah did not appear to you
2  then jehovah said to him what is that in your hand he answered a rod
3  he said throw it on the ground
so he threw it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from it
4  jehovah now said to moses reach out your hand and seize it by the tail
so he reached out and seized it and it became a rod in his hand
5  god then said this is so that they may believe that jehovah the god of their forefathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has appeared to you
6  jehovah said to him once more put your hand please into the upper fold of your garment
so he put his hand into the fold of his garment
when he drew it out why his hand was stricken with leprosy like snow
7  then he said return your hand into the upper fold of your garment
so he returned his hand into his garment
when he drew it out of the garment it was restored like the rest of his flesh
8  he said if they will not believe you or pay attention to the first sign then they will certainly heed the next sign
9  still even if they will not believe these two signs and refuse to listen to your voice you will take some water from the nile river and pour it out on the dry land and the water that you take from the nile will become blood on the dry land
10  moses now said to jehovah pardon me jehovah but i have never been a fluent speaker neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant for i am slow of speech and slow of tongue
11  jehovah said to him who made a mouth for man or who makes them speechless deaf clearsighted or blind is it not i jehovah
12  so go now and i will be with you as you speak and i will teach you what you should say
13  but he said pardon me jehovah please send anyone whom you want to send
14  then jehovahs anger blazed against moses and he said what about your brother aaron the levite i know that he can speak very well
and he is now on his way here to meet you
when he sees you his heart will rejoice
15  so you must speak to him and put the words in his mouth and i will be with you and him as you speak and i will teach you men what to do
16  he will speak for you to the people and he will be your spokesman and you will serve as god to him
17  and you will take this rod in your hand and perform the signs with it
18  so moses went back to jethʹro his fatherinlaw and said to him i want to go please and return to my brothers who are in egypt to see whether they are still alive
jethʹro said to moses go in peace
19  after that jehovah said to moses in midʹian go return to egypt because all the men who were seeking to kill you are dead
20  then moses took his wife and his sons and lifted them onto a donkey and he started back to the land of egypt
moreover moses took the rod of the true god in his hand
21  then jehovah said to moses after you have returned to egypt see that you perform before pharʹaoh all the miracles that i have empowered you to do
but i will allow his heart to become obstinate and he will not send the people away
22  you must say to pharʹaoh this is what jehovah says israel is my son my firstborn
23  i say to you send my son away so that he may serve me
but if you refuse to send him away i am going to kill your son your firstborn
24  now on the road at the lodging place jehovah met him and was seeking to put him to death
25  finally zippoʹrah took a flint and circumcised her son and caused his foreskin to touch his feet and said it is because you are a bridegroom of blood to me
26  so he let him go
at that time she said a bridegroom of blood because of the circumcision
27  then jehovah said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses
so he went and met him at the mountain of the true god and greeted him with a kiss
28  and moses told aaron all the words of jehovah who had sent him and all the signs that he had commanded him to do
29  after that moses and aaron went and gathered all the elders of the israelites
30  aaron told them all the words that jehovah had spoken to moses and he performed the signs before the eyes of the people
31  at this the people believed
when they heard that jehovah had turned his attention to the israelites and that he had seen their affliction they bowed down and prostrated themselves
26  you are to make the tabernacle with ten tent cloths of fine twisted linen blue thread purple wool and scarlet material
you are to make them with embroidered cherub designs
2  each tent cloth will be 28 cubits long and 4 cubits wide
all the tent cloths are to be the same size

4  you will make loops of blue thread on the edge of the one tent cloth at the end of the series and you are to do the same on the outermost edge of the other set where it will join
5  you will make 50 loops on the one tent cloth and 50 loops on the edge of the other tent cloth so that they will be opposite each other where they join
6  you are to make 50 gold clasps and join the tent cloths together with the clasps and the tabernacle will form one unit
7  you will also make cloths of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle
you will make 11 tent cloths
8  each tent cloth will be 30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide

9  you are to join five of the tent cloths together and join the other six tent cloths together and you are to fold over the sixth tent cloth at the front of the tent
10  and you are to make 50 loops on the edge of the one tent cloth the outermost one in the series and 50 loops on the edge of the tent cloth at the other place where they join
11  you are to make 50 copper clasps and put the clasps in the loops and join the tent together and it will become one unit
12  the remaining part of the tent cloths will serve as an overhanging
half of the tent cloth that remains will hang over the back of the tabernacle
13  the remaining length of the cloths of the tent will serve as an overhanging for the tabernacle by one cubit on each side in order to cover it
14  you will also make a covering for the tent of ram skins dyed red and over that a covering of sealskins
15  you will make the panel frames for the tabernacle out of acacia wood standing upright
16  each panel frame is to be ten cubits high and a cubit and a half wide
17  each panel frame has two tenons joined to each other
that is how you should make all the panel frames of the tabernacle
18  you are to make 20 panel frames for the south side of the tabernacle facing south
19  you will make 40 silver socket pedestals under the 20 panel frames two socket pedestals under the one panel frame for its two tenons and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame for its two tenons
20  for the other side of the tabernacle the northern side make 20 panel frames
21  and their 40 silver socket pedestals two socket pedestals under one panel frame and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame
22  for the rear section of the tabernacle to the west you will make six panel frames
23  you will make two panel frames to serve as the two rear corner posts of the tabernacle
24  they should be doubled from the bottom to the top up to the first ring
this should be done for both of them and they will form the two corner posts
25  and there will be eight panel frames and their 16 silver socket pedestals two socket pedestals under the one panel frame and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame
26  you will make bars of acacia wood five for the panel frames of the one side of the tabernacle
27  and five bars for the panel frames of the other side of the tabernacle and five bars for the panel frames of the side of the tabernacle to the west for the rear section
28  the middle bar that runs along the center of the panel frames should extend from end to end
29  you will overlay the panel frames with gold and you will make their rings of gold as holders for the bars and you will overlay the bars with gold
30  you must set up the tabernacle according to its plan that you were shown in the mountain
31  you are to make a curtain of blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine twisted linen
it will be made with cherubs embroidered on it
32  you will hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold
their hooks are to be of gold
the pillars are set on four socket pedestals of silver
33  you will hang the curtain under the clasps and bring the ark of the testimony there within the curtain
the curtain will make a division for you between the holy and the most holy
34  you must put the cover on the ark of the testimony in the most holy
35  you will place the table outside the curtain with the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle and the table you will put on the north side
36  you will make a screen for the entrance of the tent out of blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine twisted linen woven together
37  you will make five pillars of acacia for the screen and overlay them with gold
their hooks are to be of gold and you will cast five socket pedestals of copper for them
11  then jehovah said to moses one more plague i am going to bring upon pharʹaoh and egypt
after that he will send you away from here
when he does send you away he will literally drive you out of here
2  now tell the people that all the men and women should ask their neighbor for articles of silver and of gold
3  and jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the egyptians
moreover moses himself had become highly esteemed in the land of egypt among pharʹaohs servants and among the people
4  moses then said this is what jehovah has said about midnight i am going out into the midst of egypt
5  and every firstborn in the land of egypt will die from the firstborn of pharʹaoh who is sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the slave girl who is working at the hand mill and every firstborn of the livestock
6  throughout all the land of egypt there will be a great outcry such as has never occurred nor will ever occur again
7  but not even a dog will bark at the israelites at the men or their livestock so that you may know that jehovah can make a distinction between the egyptians and the israelites
8  and all your servants will certainly come down to me and prostrate themselves to me saying go you and all the people who follow you
and after that i will go out
with that he went out from pharʹaoh in the heat of anger
9  jehovah then said to moses pharʹaoh will not listen to you in order for my miracles to be multiplied in the land of egypt
10  moses and aaron performed all these miracles before pharʹaoh but jehovah allowed pharʹaohs heart to become obstinate so that he did not send the israelites away from his land
8  then jehovah said to moses go in to pharʹaoh and say to him this is what jehovah says send my people away so that they may serve me
2  if you keep refusing to send them away i will plague all your territory with frogs
3  and the nile river will swarm with frogs and they will come up and enter into your house into your bedroom on your bed into the houses of your servants and on your people into your ovens and into your kneading troughs
4  on you on your people and on all your servants the frogs will come up
5  jehovah later said to moses say to aaron stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers the nile canals and the marshes and make the frogs come up over the land of egypt
6  so aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs began to come up and to cover the land of egypt
7  however the magicpracticing priests did the same thing by their secret arts and they too made the frogs come up over the land of egypt
8  pharʹaoh then called moses and aaron and said plead with jehovah to remove the frogs from me and my people as i want to send the people away so that they may sacrifice to jehovah
9  then moses said to pharʹaoh i leave to you the honor of telling me when i should plead to have the frogs removed from you your servants your people and your houses
only in the nile river will they be left
10  to this he said tomorrow
so he said it will be according to your word so that you may know that there is no one else like jehovah our god
11  the frogs will depart from you your houses your servants and your people
they will be left only in the nile
12  so moses and aaron went out from pharʹaoh and moses pleaded with jehovah about the frogs that he had brought upon pharʹaoh
13  then jehovah did as moses asked and the frogs began to die in the houses the courtyards and the fields
14  they were piling them up in countless heaps and the land began to stink
15  when pharʹaoh saw that there was relief he hardened his heart and he refused to listen to them just as jehovah had said
16  jehovah now said to moses say to aaron stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the earth and it must become gnats in all the land of egypt
17  and they did this
aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth and the gnats came on man and beast
all the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of egypt
18  the magicpracticing priests tried to do the same and produce gnats by their secret arts but they could not
and the gnats came on man and beast
19  so the magicpracticing priests said to pharʹaoh it is the finger of god but pharʹaohs heart continued to be obstinate and he did not listen to them just as jehovah had said
20  then jehovah said to moses get up early in the morning and station yourself in front of pharʹaoh
look he is coming out to the water and you must say to him this is what jehovah has said send my people away so that they may serve me
21  but if you do not send my people away i will send on you your servants and your people and into your houses the gadfly and the houses of egypt will be full of gadflies and they will even cover the ground they stand on
22  on that day i will certainly set apart the land of goʹshen where my people are dwelling
no gadflies will exist there and by this you will know that i jehovah am here in the land
23  and i will make a distinction between my people and your people
tomorrow this sign will take place
24  and jehovah did so and heavy swarms of gadflies began to invade the house of pharʹaoh and the houses of his servants and all the land of egypt
the land was ruined by the gadflies
25  finally pharʹaoh called moses and aaron and said go sacrifice to your god in the land
26  but moses said it is not proper to do so because what we would sacrifice to jehovah our god would be detestable to the egyptians
if we would make a sacrifice that was detestable to the egyptians right before their eyes would they not stone us
27  we will make a threeday journey into the wilderness and there we will sacrifice to jehovah our god just as he has said to us
28  pharʹaoh now said i will send you away to sacrifice to jehovah your god in the wilderness
only you must not go so far away
plead in my behalf
29  then moses said now i am going away from you and i will plead with jehovah and the gadflies will depart from pharʹaoh his servants and his people tomorrow
but pharʹaoh must stop trifling with us by refusing to send the people away to sacrifice to jehovah
30  moses then went out from pharʹaoh and pleaded with jehovah
31  so jehovah did according to moses word and the gadflies departed from pharʹaoh his servants and his people
not one was left
32  however pharʹaoh again hardened his heart and did not send the people away
30  you are to make an altar as a place for burning incense you will make it of acacia wood
2  it should be square one cubit long one cubit wide and two cubits high
its horns will be one piece with it
3  you are to overlay it with pure gold its top surface its sides all around and its horns and you are to make a gold border around it
4  you will also make two rings of gold for it below its border on two opposite sides and these will hold the poles used to carry it
5  make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold
6  you are to put it before the curtain that is near the ark of the testimony before the cover that is over the testimony where i will present myself to you
7  aaron will burn perfumed incense on it making it smoke on the altar when he maintains the lamps each morning
8  also when aaron lights the lamps at twilight he will burn the incense
it is a regular incense offering before jehovah throughout your generations
9  you must not offer on it unauthorized incense or a burnt offering or a grain offering and you must not pour a drink offering on it
10  aaron must make atonement on its horns once a year
with some of the blood of the sin offering of the atonement he will make atonement for it once a year throughout your generations
it is most holy to jehovah
11  then jehovah said to moses
12  whenever you take a census and count the sons of israel each one must give a ransom for his life to jehovah at the time of the census
this is so that no plague may be brought upon them when they are registered
13  this is what all those who are registered will give a half shekel by the standard shekel of the holy place
twenty geʹrahs equal a shekel
a half shekel is the contribution to jehovah
14  everyone registered who is 20 years old and up will give jehovahs contribution
15  the rich should not give more and the poor should not give less than the half shekel as a contribution to jehovah to make atonement for your lives
16  you are to take the silver money of the atonement from the israelites and give it in behalf of the service of the tent of meeting that it may serve as a remembrance before jehovah for the israelites to make atonement for your lives
17  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
18  make a copper basin and its stand for washing then place it between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water into it
19  aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet there
20  when they go into the tent of meeting or when they approach the altar to minister and to make offerings of fire and smoke to jehovah they will wash with water so that they do not die
21  they must wash their hands and their feet so that they may not die and it must serve as a permanent regulation for them for him and his offspring throughout their generations
22  jehovah continued to speak to moses
23  next take the choicest perfumes 500 units of solidified myrrh and half that amount 250 units of sweet cinnamon 250 units of sweet calamus
24  and 500 units of cassia measured by the standard shekel of the holy place along with a hin of olive oil
25  then make out of it a holy anointing oil it should be skillfully blended together
it is to be a holy anointing oil
26  you are to anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony with it
27  as well as the table and all its utensils the lampstand and its utensils the altar of incense
28  the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and the basin and its stand
29  you must sanctify them that they may become most holy
anyone touching them is to be holy
30  and you will anoint aaron and his sons and sanctify them to serve as priests to me
31  you will speak to the israelites saying this is to continue as a holy anointing oil to me during your generations
32  it is not to be applied to the flesh of mankind and you must not make anything with a composition like it
it is something holy
it is to continue as something holy for you
33  anyone who makes an ointment like it and who puts some of it on an unauthorized person must be cut off from his people
34  then jehovah said to moses take equal portions of these perfumes stacte drops onycha perfumed galbanum and pure frankincense
35  make it into an incense the spice mixture should be skillfully blended salted pure and holy
36  you are to pound some of it into fine powder and put some of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting where i will present myself to you
it should be most holy to you
37  you must not make for your own use the incense that you make with this composition
you are to regard it as something holy to jehovah
38  whoever makes any like it to enjoy its smell must be cut off from his people
16  after they departed from eʹlim the entire assembly of the israelites eventually came to the wilderness of sin which is between eʹlim and siʹnai on the 15th day of the second month after their departure from the land of egypt
2  then the entire assembly of the israelites began to murmur against moses and aaron in the wilderness
3  the israelites kept saying to them if only we had died by jehovahs hand in the land of egypt while we were sitting by the pots of meat while we were eating bread to satisfaction
now you have brought us out into this wilderness to put this whole congregation to death by famine
4  then jehovah said to moses here i am raining down bread for you from the heavens and each of the people should go out to gather his amount day by day so that i may put them to the test to see whether they will walk in my law or not
5  but on the sixth day when they prepare what they have gathered it is to be double the amount that they pick up on each of the other days
6  so moses and aaron said to all the israelites in the evening you will certainly know that it is jehovah who brought you out of the land of egypt
7  in the morning you will see jehovahs glory for he has heard your murmurings against jehovah
who are we that you should murmur against us
8  moses continued when jehovah gives you meat to eat in the evening and in the morning bread to satisfaction you will see that jehovah has heard your murmurings that you are murmuring against him
but who are we your murmurings are not against us but against jehovah
9  then moses said to aaron tell the entire assembly of the israelites come near before jehovah for he has heard your murmurings
10  as soon as aaron had spoken to the entire assembly of the israelites they turned and faced toward the wilderness and look jehovahs glory appeared in the cloud
11  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
12  i have heard the murmurings of the israelites
tell them at twilight you will eat meat and in the morning you will be satisfied with bread and you will certainly know that i am jehovah your god
13  so that evening quail came and covered the camp and in the morning a layer of dew was all around the camp
14  when the layer of dew evaporated there was a fine flaky substance on the surface of the wilderness as fine as frost on the ground
15  when the israelites saw it they began to say to one another what is it for they did not know what it was
moses said to them it is the bread that jehovah has given you for food
16  this is what jehovah has commanded each one should gather it according to how much he can eat
you are to take an omer measure for each individual according to the number of the people that each of you has in his tent
17  the israelites began to do so they gathered it some gathering much and some gathering little
18  when they would measure it by the omer the one who had gathered much had no surplus and the one who had gathered little had no shortage
they each gathered it according to what they could eat
19  then moses said to them nobody should leave any of it until the morning
20  but they did not listen to moses
when some men left some of it until the morning it bred worms and stank and moses became indignant at them
21  they would pick it up morning by morning each one according to what he could eat
when the sun got hot it melted
22  on the sixth day they picked up twice as much bread two omer measures for each person
so all the chieftains of the assembly came and reported it to moses
23  at that he said to them it is what jehovah has said
tomorrow there will be a complete rest a holy sabbath to jehovah
bake what you need to bake and boil what you need to boil then save whatever is left over and keep it until the morning
24  so they saved it until the morning just as moses had commanded and it did not stink nor were there maggots in it
25  then moses said eat it today because today is a sabbath to jehovah
today you will not find it on the ground
26  you will pick it up for six days but on the seventh day the sabbath there will be none
27  however some of the people did go out to pick it up on the seventh day but they found nothing
28  so jehovah said to moses how long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws
29  take notice of the fact that jehovah has given you the sabbath
that is why he is giving you the bread for two days on the sixth day
everyone must stay where he is nobody is to leave his locality on the seventh day
30  so the people observed the sabbath on the seventh day
31  the house of israel named the bread manna
it was white like coriander seed and its taste was like that of flat cakes with honey
32  then moses said this is what jehovah has commanded fill an omer measure of it as something to be kept throughout your generations so that they may see the bread that i gave you to eat in the wilderness when i was bringing you out of the land of egypt
33  so moses said to aaron take a jar and put in it an omer measure of manna and deposit it before jehovah as something to be kept throughout your generations
34  just as jehovah commanded moses aaron placed it before the testimony so that it might be preserved
35  the israelites ate the manna for 40 years until they came to a land that was inhabited
they ate the manna until they came to the frontier of the land of caʹnaan
36  now an omer is a tenth of an eʹphah measure
35  moses later gathered the entire assembly of the israelites together and said to them these are the things that jehovah has commanded to be done
2  work may be done for six days but the seventh day will become something holy to you a sabbath of complete rest to jehovah
anybody doing work on it will be put to death
3  you must not light a fire in any of your dwelling places on the sabbath day
4  moses then said to the entire assembly of the israelites this is what jehovah has commanded
5  take up a contribution for jehovah from among yourselves
let everyone with a willing heart bring a contribution for jehovah gold silver copper
6  blue thread purple wool scarlet material fine linen goat hair
7  ram skins dyed red sealskins acacia wood
8  oil for the lamps balsam for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense
9  onyx stones and other stones for setting in the ephʹod and the breastpiece
10  let all who are skilled among you come and make everything that jehovah has commanded
11  namely the tabernacle with its tent and its covering its clasps and its panel frames its bars its pillars and its socket pedestals
12  the ark and its poles the cover and the curtain for the screen
13  the table and its poles and all its utensils and the showbread
14  the lampstand for light and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for lighting
15  the altar of incense and its poles the anointing oil and the perfumed incense the screen for the tabernacles entrance
16  the altar of burnt offering and its copper grating its poles and all its utensils the basin and its stand
17  the hanging curtains of the courtyard its pillars and its socket pedestals the screen of the entrance to the courtyard
18  the tent pins of the tabernacle and the tent pins of the courtyard and their cords
19  the finely woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons for serving as priests
20  so all the assembly of the israelites went out from before moses
21  then everyone whose heart impelled him and everyone whose spirit incited him came and brought their contribution for jehovah to be used for the tent of meeting for all its service and for the holy garments
22  they kept coming the men along with the women each with a willing heart bringing brooches earrings rings and other jewelry as well as all sorts of articles of gold
they all presented their offerings of gold to jehovah
23  and all who had blue thread purple wool scarlet material fine linen goat hair ram skins dyed red and sealskins brought them
24  all those contributing silver and copper brought jehovahs contribution and all who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it
25  all the skilled women spun with their hands and they brought what they had spun blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine linen
26  and all the skilled women whose hearts impelled them spun the goat hair
27  and the chieftains brought onyx stones and other stones to be set in the ephʹod and the breastpiece
28  and the balsam and the oil for lighting and for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense
29  all the men and women whose hearts incited them brought something for the work that jehovah through moses had commanded to be done the israelites brought it as a voluntary offering to jehovah
30  then moses said to the israelites see jehovah has chosen bezʹalel the son of uʹri the son of hur of the tribe of judah
31  he has filled him with the spirit of god giving him wisdom understanding and knowledge of every sort of craftsmanship
32  for making artistic designs for working with gold silver and copper
33  for cutting and setting stones and for making all kinds of artistic wood products
34  and he has put it into his heart to teach he and ohoʹliab the son of ahisʹamach of the tribe of dan
35  he has filled them with skill to do all the work of a craftsman an embroiderer and a weaver using blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine linen and of a loom worker
these men will do every sort of work and prepare every sort of design
18  now jethʹro the priest of midʹian moses fatherinlaw heard about all that god had done for moses and for his people israel how jehovah had brought israel out of egypt
2  jethʹro moses fatherinlaw had taken in zippoʹrah moses wife when she was sent back to him
3  along with her two sons
one son was named gerʹshom because moses said i have become a foreign resident in a foreign land
4  and the other was named elieʹzer because he said the god of my father is my helper who rescued me from pharʹaohs sword
5  so jethʹro moses fatherinlaw along with moses sons and his wife came to moses into the wilderness where he was camping at the mountain of the true god
6  then he sent word to moses i your fatherinlaw jethʹro am coming to you with your wife and her two sons
7  at once moses went out to meet his fatherinlaw and he bowed down and kissed him
each of them asked about the others welfare and then they went into the tent
8  moses related to his fatherinlaw all that jehovah had done to pharʹaoh and egypt in behalf of israel all the hardships that had befallen them along the way and how jehovah had delivered them
9  jethʹro rejoiced over all the good that jehovah had done for israel by rescuing them from egypt
10  then jethʹro said praised be jehovah who rescued you from egypt and from pharʹaoh and who rescued the people from under egypts control
11  now i know that jehovah is greater than all the other gods because of what he did to those who acted arrogantly against his people
12  then jethʹro moses fatherinlaw brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron and all the elders of israel came to eat a meal with moses fatherinlaw before the true god
13  on the next day moses sat down as usual to serve as judge for the people and the people kept standing before moses from morning until evening
14  when moses fatherinlaw saw all that he was doing for the people he said what is this that you are doing for the people why do you sit here alone with all the people standing before you from morning until evening
15  moses said to his fatherinlaw because the people keep coming to me to inquire of god
16  when a case arises it comes to me and i must judge between one person and the other and i make known the decisions of the true god and his laws
17  moses fatherinlaw said to him what you are doing is not good
18  you will surely wear out both you and this people who are with you because this is too big a load for you and you cannot carry it by yourself
19  now listen to me
i will give you advice and god will be with you
you serve as representative for the people before the true god and you must bring the cases to the true god
20  you should warn them about what the regulations and the laws are and make known to them the way in which they should walk and the work that they should do
21  but you should select from the people capable men fearing god trustworthy men hating dishonest profit and appoint these over them as chiefs over thousands chiefs over hundreds chiefs over fifties and chiefs over tens
22  they should judge the people when cases arise and they will bring every difficult case to you but every minor case they will decide
make it easier for yourself by letting them share the load along with you
23  if you do this and god so commands you you will be able to stand the strain and everyone will go home satisfied
24  moses immediately listened to his fatherinlaw and did all that he had said
25  moses chose capable men out of all israel and appointed them heads over the people as chiefs of thousands chiefs of hundreds chiefs of fifties and chiefs of tens
26  so they judged the people when cases arose
a difficult case they would bring to moses but every minor case they would judge
27  after that moses saw his fatherinlaw off and he went his way to his land
17  the entire assembly of the israelites departed from the wilderness of sin by stages according to the order of jehovah and they camped at rephʹidim
but there was no water for the people to drink
2  so the people began quarreling with moses and saying give us water to drink
but moses said to them why are you quarreling with me why do you keep putting jehovah to the test
3  but the people were very thirsty for water there and they kept murmuring against moses and saying why have you brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our sons and our livestock with thirst
4  finally moses cried out to jehovah what should i do with this people a little longer and they will stone me
5  then jehovah said to moses go ahead of the people and take with you some of the elders of israel and your rod with which you struck the nile river
take it in your hand and walk on
6  look i will be standing before you there on the rock in hoʹreb
you must strike the rock and water will come out of it and the people will drink it
moses did so before the eyes of the elders of israel
7  so he named the place masʹsah and merʹibah because of the quarreling of the israelites and because they put jehovah to the test by saying is jehovah in our midst or not
8  then the amalʹekites came and fought against israel in rephʹidim
9  at this moses said to joshua choose men for us and go out to fight against the amalʹekites
tomorrow i will stand on top of the hill with the rod of the true god in my hand
10  then joshua did just as moses told him and he fought against the amalʹekites
and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill
11  as long as moses kept his hands lifted up the israelites prevailed but as soon as he would let down his hands the amalʹekites prevailed
12  when the hands of moses were heavy they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it
then aaron and hur one on each side supported his hands so that his hands remained steady until the sun set
13  thus joshua defeated amʹalek and his people with the sword
14  jehovah now said to moses write this as a memorial in the book and repeat it to joshua i will completely wipe out the memory of amʹalek from under the heavens
15  then moses built an altar and named it jehoʹvahnisʹsi
16  saying because his hand is against the throne of jah jehovah will have war with amʹalek from generation to generation
9  so jehovah said to moses go in to pharʹaoh and say to him this is what jehovah the god of the hebrews has said send my people away so that they may serve me
2  but if you refuse to send them away and you keep holding them
3  look jehovahs hand will come against your livestock in the field
on the horses the donkeys the camels the herd and the flock there will be a devastating plague
4  and jehovah will certainly make a distinction between the livestock of israel and the livestock of egypt and nothing that belongs to the israelites will die
5  moreover jehovah set an appointed time saying tomorrow jehovah will do this in the land
6  and jehovah did this on the very next day and all sorts of livestock of egypt began to die but not one of israels livestock died
7  when pharʹaoh inquired look not so much as one of israels livestock had died
nevertheless pharʹaohs heart continued to be unresponsive and he did not send the people away
8  jehovah then said to moses and aaron fill both of your hands with soot from a kiln and moses must throw it into the air in front of pharʹaoh
9  and it will become a fine dust on all the land of egypt and it will become festering boils on man and beast in all the land of egypt
10  so they took soot from a kiln and stood before pharʹaoh and moses tossed it into the air and it became festering boils breaking out on man and beast
11  the magicpracticing priests were unable to stand before moses because of the boils for they had developed on the magicpracticing priests and on all the egyptians
12  but jehovah allowed pharʹaohs heart to become obstinate and he did not listen to them just as jehovah had told moses
13  then jehovah said to moses get up early in the morning and station yourself in front of pharʹaoh and say to him this is what jehovah the god of the hebrews has said send my people away so that they may serve me
14  for now i am directing all my blows to strike your heart your servants and your people so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth
15  for by now i could have thrust my hand out to strike you and your people with a devastating plague and you would have been wiped out from the earth
16  but for this very reason i have kept you in existence to show you my power and to have my name declared in all the earth
17  are you still behaving arrogantly against my people by not sending them away
18  here i will cause a very great hail to rain down tomorrow about this time such as has never occurred in egypt from the day it was founded until now
19  therefore send word to bring all your livestock and all that is yours in the field under shelter
every man and beast caught in the field and not brought into the house will die when the hail comes down on them
20  anyone among pharʹaohs servants who feared jehovahs word quickly brought his own servants and his livestock into the houses
21  but whoever did not take jehovahs word to heart left his servants and his livestock in the field
22  jehovah now said to moses stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that hail may come down on all the land of egypt on man and beast and all the vegetation of the field in the land of egypt
23  so moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens and jehovah sent thunder and hail and fire fell down to the earth and jehovah kept making it rain down hail on the land of egypt
24  there was hail and there was fire flashing in the midst of the hail
it was very heavy there had never been any like it in the land since egypt had become a nation
25  the hail struck everything in the field throughout the land of egypt from man to beast and it struck down all the vegetation and shattered all the trees of the field
26  only in the land of goʹshen where the israelites were there was no hail
27  so pharʹaoh sent for moses and aaron and said to them i have sinned this time
jehovah is righteous and i and my people are in the wrong
28  plead with jehovah that there may be an end to gods thunder and hail
then i will be willing to send you away and you will not stay any longer
29  so moses said to him as soon as i go out of the city i will spread out my hands before jehovah
the thunder will stop and the hail will not continue any longer so that you may know that the earth belongs to jehovah
30  but as for you and your servants i know already that even then you will not fear jehovah god
31  now the flax and the barley had been struck down because the barley was in the ear and the flax had flower buds
32  but the wheat and the spelt had not been struck down because they were later crops
33  moses now went out of the city from pharʹaoh and spread out his hands before jehovah and the thunder and the hail stopped and the rain quit pouring down on the earth
34  when pharʹaoh saw that the rain the hail and the thunder had stopped he sinned again and hardened his heart he as well as his servants
35  and pharʹaohs heart continued obstinate and he did not send the israelites away just as jehovah had stated through moses

21  in the tent of meeting outside the curtain that is near the testimony aaron and his sons will arrange to keep the lamps lit from evening until morning before jehovah
it is a lasting statute for all their generations to be carried out by the israelites
7  jehovah then said to moses see i have made you like god to pharʹaoh and aaron your own brother will become your prophet
2  you are to repeat everything that i will command you and aaron your brother will speak to pharʹaoh and he will send the israelites away from his land
3  as for me i will allow pharʹaohs heart to become obstinate and i will multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of egypt
4  but pharʹaoh will not listen to you and i will lay my hand upon egypt and bring my multitudes my people the israelites out of the land of egypt with great judgments
5  and the egyptians will certainly know that i am jehovah when i stretch out my hand against egypt and bring the israelites out from among them
6  moses and aaron did what jehovah had commanded them they did just so
7  moses was 80 years old and aaron was 83 years old when they spoke to pharʹaoh
8  jehovah now said to moses and aaron
9  if pharʹaoh says to you perform a miracle then tell aaron take your rod and throw it down before pharʹaoh
it will become a big snake
10  so moses and aaron went in to pharʹaoh and did exactly as jehovah had commanded
aaron threw his rod down before pharʹaoh and his servants and it became a big snake
11  however pharʹaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers and the magicpracticing priests of egypt also did the same thing with their magic
12  each one threw down his rod and they became big snakes but aarons rod swallowed up their rods
13  still pharʹaohs heart became obstinate and he did not listen to them just as jehovah had said
14  then jehovah said to moses pharʹaohs heart is unresponsive
he has refused to send the people away
15  go to pharʹaoh in the morning
look he is going out to the water and you should station yourself to meet him by the edge of the nile river and take with you in your hand the rod that turned into a serpent
16  and you must say to him jehovah the god of the hebrews has sent me to you and he says send my people away so that they may serve me in the wilderness but you have not obeyed until now
17  this is what jehovah says by this you will know that i am jehovah
here i am striking the water that is in the nile river with the rod that is in my hand and it will turn into blood
18  and the fish that are in the nile will die and the nile will stink and the egyptians will find it impossible to drink water from the nile
19  then jehovah said to moses say to aaron take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of egypt over its rivers over its canals over its marshes and over all its reservoirs that they may become blood
there will be blood in all the land of egypt even in the wooden and stone containers
20  immediately moses and aaron did just as jehovah had commanded
he lifted up the rod and struck the water that was in the nile river before the eyes of pharʹaoh and his servants and all the water that was in the river was turned into blood
21  and the fish that were in the river died and the river began to stink and the egyptians were unable to drink water from the nile and there was blood throughout the land of egypt
22  nevertheless the magicpracticing priests of egypt did the same thing with their secret arts so that pharʹaohs heart continued to be obstinate and he did not listen to them just as jehovah had said
23  then pharʹaoh returned to his house and he did not take this to heart either
24  so all the egyptians were digging all around the nile for water to drink because they could not drink any water of the nile
25  and seven full days passed after jehovah struck the nile
34  then jehovah said to moses carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones and i will write on the tablets the words that appeared on the first tablets which you shattered
2  get ready for the morning as you will go up in the morning to mount siʹnai and station yourself before me there on the top of the mountain
3  but nobody may go up with you and nobody else should be seen anywhere on the mountain
not even the flocks or herds should graze in front of that mountain
4  so moses carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones and got up early in the morning and went up mount siʹnai just as jehovah had commanded him and he took the two tablets of stone in his hand
5  then jehovah came down in the cloud and stationed himself with him there and declared the name of jehovah
6  jehovah was passing before him and declaring jehovah jehovah a god merciful and compassionate slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth
7  showing loyal love to thousands pardoning error and transgression and sin but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons and upon grandsons upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation
8  moses hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself
9  then he said if now i have found favor in your eyes o jehovah then please jehovah go along with us in our midst although we are an obstinate people and forgive our error and our sin and take us as your own possession
10  in turn he said here i am making a covenant before all your people i will do wonderful things that have never been done in all the earth or among all the nations and all the people among whom you live will see the work of jehovah for it is an aweinspiring thing that i am doing with you
11  pay attention to what i am commanding you today
here i am driving out from before you the amʹorites the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites
12  be careful that you do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going or it may prove to be a snare among you
13  but you are to pull down their altars you are to shatter their sacred pillars and their sacred poles you are to cut down
14  you must not bow down to another god for jehovah is known for requiring exclusive devotion
yes he is a god who requires exclusive devotion
15  be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land because when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods someone will invite you and you will eat from his sacrifice
16  then you will surely take some of their daughters for your sons and their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to prostitute themselves to their gods
17  you must not make gods of cast metal
18  you are to observe the festival of unleavened bread
you will eat unleavened bread just as i have commanded you do this for seven days at the appointed time in the month of aʹbib because it was in the month of aʹbib that you came out of egypt
19  every firstborn male is mine including all your livestock whether the first male bull or sheep
20  the firstling of a donkey you are to redeem with a sheep
but if you do not redeem it then you must break its neck
you are to redeem every firstborn of your sons
no one may appear before me emptyhanded
21  six days you are to work but on the seventh day you will rest
even during plowing time and in harvest you will rest
22  and you will celebrate your festival of weeks with the first ripe fruits of the wheat harvest and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year
23  three times a year all your men are to appear before the true lord jehovah the god of israel
24  for i will drive the nations away from before you and i will enlarge your territory and nobody will desire your land while you are going up to see the face of jehovah your god three times a year
25  you must not offer the blood of my sacrifice along with anything leavened
the sacrifice of the festival of the passover should not be kept overnight until the morning
26  the best of the first ripe fruits of your soil you are to bring to the house of jehovah your god
you must not boil a young goat in its mothers milk
27  jehovah went on to say to moses you are to write down these words because in accordance with these words i am making a covenant with you and with israel
28  and he remained there with jehovah 40 days and 40 nights
he ate no bread and drank no water
and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant the ten commandments
29  moses then came down from mount siʹnai and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hand
when he came down from the mountain moses did not know that the skin of his face was emitting rays because he had been speaking with god
30  when aaron and all the israelites saw moses they noticed that the skin of his face emitted rays and they were afraid to go near him
31  but moses called to them so aaron and all the chieftains of the assembly came to him and moses spoke with them
32  after that all the israelites came near to him and he gave them all the commands that jehovah had given him on mount siʹnai
33  when moses would finish speaking with them he would put a veil over his face
34  but when moses would go in before jehovah to speak with him he would take off the veil until he went out
then he went out and revealed to the israelites the commands he had received
35  and the israelites saw that the skin of moses face emitted rays then moses put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with god
37  bezʹalel then made the ark of acacia wood
it was two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high
2  he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside and made a border of gold around it

13  further he cast four rings of gold for it and placed the rings on the four corners where the four legs were attached
14  the rings were near the rim as holders for the poles used for carrying the table

9  you must not oppress a foreign resident
you know how it feels to be a foreigner because you were foreign residents in the land of egypt
10  you are to sow your land with seed and gather its produce for six years
11  but the seventh year you should leave it uncultivated and let it lie fallow and the poor among your people will eat of it and what they leave the wild animals of the field will eat
that is what you should do with your vineyard and your olive grove
12  six days you are to do your work but on the seventh day you are to cease from your labor in order that your bull and your donkey may rest and the son of your slave girl and the foreign resident may refresh themselves
13  you must be careful to do all that i have said to you and you must not mention the names of other gods they should not be heard on your lips

18  you must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened
and the sacrifices of fat offered at my festivals should not stay overnight until the morning
19  you are to bring the best of the first ripe fruits of your ground to the house of jehovah your god
you must not boil a young goat in its mothers milk
20  i am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you on the way and to bring you into the place that i have prepared
21  pay attention to him and obey his voice
do not rebel against him for he will not pardon your transgressions because my name is in him
22  however if you strictly obey his voice and do all that i say i will show hostility to your enemies and oppose those who oppose you
23  for my angel will go ahead of you and will bring you to the amʹorites the hitʹtites the perʹizzites the caʹnaanites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites and i will annihilate them

28  i will send the feeling of dejection ahead of you and it will drive the hiʹvites the caʹnaanites and the hitʹtites out from before you
29  i will not drive them out from before you in one year so that the land does not become desolate and the wild animals of the field multiply against you
30  little by little i will drive them out from before you until you become fruitful and take possession of the land
31  i will set your boundary from the red sea to the sea of the philisʹtines and from the wilderness to the river for i will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand and you will drive them out from before you
32  you must not make a covenant with them or their gods
33  they should not dwell in your land so that they may not cause you to sin against me
if you should serve their gods it would surely become a snare to you
22  if a man steals a bull or a sheep and he slaughters or sells it he is to compensate with five bulls for the bull and four sheep for the sheep
2  if a thief is found in the act of breaking in and he gets struck and dies there is no bloodguilt for him
3  but if it happens after sunrise there is bloodguilt for him

9  in all cases of illegal possession of goods concerning a bull a donkey a sheep a garment or anything lost of which he may say this is mine both parties will present their case before the true god
the one whom god pronounces guilty is to make double compensation to his fellow man
10  if a man gives his fellow man a donkey or a bull or a sheep or any domestic animal to keep and it dies or gets maimed or gets led away while nobody is looking
11  there should be an oath made between them before jehovah that he did not lay his hand on the goods of his fellow man and the owner must accept it
the other man is not to make compensation
12  but if the animal has been stolen from him he is to make compensation to its owner
13  if it was torn by a wild animal he is to bring it as evidence
he is not to make compensation for something torn by a wild animal
14  but if anybody asks to borrow an animal from his fellow man and it gets maimed or it dies while its owner is not with it the man who borrowed it must make compensation
15  if its owner is with it he is not to make compensation
if it was hired the money paid for the hire is the compensation
16  now if a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged and he lies down with her he must pay the brideprice for her to become his wife

18  you must not allow a sorceress to live
19  anyone lying down with an animal must surely be put to death
20  whoever sacrifices to any gods but jehovah alone is to be devoted to destruction
21  you must not mistreat a foreign resident or oppress him for you were foreign residents in the land of egypt

25  if you lend money to anyone poor of my people someone who is dwelling with you you must not become like a moneylender to him
you must not charge him interest
26  if you seize the garment of your fellow man as security for a loan you are to return it to him by sunset
27  for it is his only covering his clothing to cover his body in what will he lie down to sleep when he cries out to me i will certainly hear for i am compassionate
28  you must not curse god nor curse a chieftain among your people
29  you must not hesitate to make offerings from your abundant produce and the overflow of your presses

38  he made the altar of burnt offering out of acacia wood
it was square five cubits long five cubits wide and three cubits high
2  then he made its horns on its four corners
its horns were one piece with it
next he overlaid it with copper
3  after that he made all the utensils of the altar the cans the shovels the bowls the forks and the fire holders
all its utensils he made of copper
4  he also made a grating for the altar a network of copper under its rim down toward its center
5  he cast four rings on the four corners near the grating of copper as holders for the poles
6  after that he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with copper
7  he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it
he made the altar in the form of a hollow chest of planks
8  then he made the basin of copper and its copper stand he used the mirrors of the women who were organized to serve at the entrance of the tent of meeting
9  then he made the courtyard
for the south side of the courtyard facing south he made the hanging curtains of fine twisted linen for 100 cubits
10  there were 20 pillars and 20 socket pedestals of copper and the hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of silver
11  also for the north side there were 100 cubits of hanging curtains

15  and for the other wing on the other side of the entrance of the courtyard there were hanging curtains for 15 cubits with three pillars and three socket pedestals
16  all the hanging curtains around the courtyard were of fine twisted linen
17  the socket pedestals for the pillars were of copper the hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of silver the tops were overlaid with silver and there were silver fasteners for all the pillars of the courtyard
18  the screen of the entrance of the courtyard was woven of blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine twisted linen
it was 20 cubits long and 5 cubits high the same height as the hanging curtains of the courtyard
19  their four pillars and their four socket pedestals were made of copper
their hooks were of silver and their tops and connectors were overlaid with silver
20  all the tent pins for the tabernacle and around the courtyard were of copper
21  the following is the inventory of the tabernacle the tabernacle of the testimony which was inventoried at the command of moses as the responsibility of the levites under the direction of ithʹamar the son of aaron the priest
22  bezʹalel the son of uʹri the son of hur of the tribe of judah did all that jehovah had commanded moses
23  with him was ohoʹliab the son of ahisʹamach of the tribe of dan a craftsman and an embroiderer and a weaver of the blue thread the purple wool the scarlet material and the fine linen
24  all the gold that was used for all the work of the holy place equaled the amount of the gold of the wave offering 29 talents and 730 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place
25  and the silver of the ones registered of the assembly was 100 talents and 1775 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place
26  the half shekel for each individual was half a shekel by the standard shekel of the holy place for every man who was among those registered from 20 years of age and up amounting to 603550
27  the casting of the socket pedestals of the holy place and the socket pedestals of the curtain amounted to 100 talents 100 socket pedestals equaled 100 talents one talent for each socket pedestal
28  from the 1775 shekels he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and joined them together
29  the copper of the offering was 70 talents and 2400 shekels
30  with this he made the socket pedestals of the entrance of the tent of meeting the copper altar and its copper grating all the utensils of the altar
31  the socket pedestals around the courtyard the socket pedestals of the entrance of the courtyard and all the tent pins of the tabernacle and all the tent pins around the courtyard
32  meanwhile the people saw that moses was taking a long time coming down from the mountain
so the people gathered around aaron and said to him get up make for us a god who will go ahead of us because we do not know what has happened to this moses the man who led us up out of the land of egypt
2  at this aaron said to them take the gold earrings from the ears of your wives your sons and your daughters and bring them to me
3  so all the people began taking off the gold earrings that were in their ears and bringing them to aaron
4  then he took the gold from them and he formed it with an engraving tool and made it into a statue of a calf
they began to say this is your god o israel who led you up out of the land of egypt
5  when aaron saw this he built an altar before it
then aaron called out there is a festival to jehovah tomorrow
6  so they got up early on the next day and began offering up burnt offerings and presenting communion sacrifices
after that the people sat down to eat and drink
then they got up to have a good time
7  jehovah now said to moses go descend because your people whom you led up out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves
8  they have quickly deviated from the way i commanded them to go
they have made for themselves a statue of a calf and they keep bowing down to it and sacrificing to it and saying this is your god o israel who led you up out of the land of egypt
9  jehovah went on to say to moses i have seen that this is an obstinate people
10  so now let me be and i will exterminate them in my burning anger and let me make a great nation from you instead
11  then moses appealed to jehovah his god and said why o jehovah should you turn your burning anger against your people after bringing them out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
12  why should the egyptians say he had evil intentions when he led them out
he wanted to kill them in the mountains and exterminate them from the surface of the earth turn from your burning anger and reconsider your decision to bring this calamity on your people
13  remember your servants abraham isaac and israel to whom you swore by yourself and said i will multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens and i will give all this land that i have designated to your offspring so that they may take it as a permanent possession
14  so jehovah began to reconsider the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on his people
15  moses then turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand
the tablets were inscribed on both sides they were written on the front and on the back
16  the tablets were the workmanship of god and the writing was the writing of god engraved on the tablets
17  when joshua began to hear the noise of the people because of their shouting he said to moses there is the sound of battle in the camp
18  but moses said it is not the sound of singing over a victoryand it is not the sound of wailing over a defeati hear the sound of another kind of singing
19  as soon as moses got near the camp and saw the calf and the dances his anger began to blaze and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain
20  he took the calf that they had made and he burned it with fire and crushed it into powder then he scattered it on the water and made the israelites drink it
21  and moses said to aaron what did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon them
22  aaron replied do not be enraged my lord
you well know that the people are inclined to do evil
23  so they said to me make for us a god who will go ahead of us for we do not know what has happened to this moses the man who led us up out of the land of egypt
24  so i said to them whoever has any gold must take it off and give it to me
then i threw it into the fire and out came this calf
25  moses saw that the people were unrestrained for aaron had let them go unrestrained so that they were a disgrace before their opposers
26  then moses took his position in the gate of the camp and said who is on jehovahs side come to me and all the levites gathered around him
27  he now said to them this is what jehovah the god of israel has said each of you must fasten on his sword and pass through all the camp from gate to gate killing his brother his neighbor and his close companion
28  the levites did what moses said
so about 3000 men were killed on that day
29  then moses said set yourselves apart for jehovah today for each of you has gone against his own son and his own brother today he will give you a blessing
30  on the very next day moses said to the people you committed a very great sin and now i will go up to jehovah to see if i can make amends for your sin
31  so moses returned to jehovah and said what a great sin this people has committed they made themselves a god of gold
32  but now if you are willing pardon their sin if not please wipe me out from your book that you have written
33  however jehovah said to moses whoever has sinned against me i will wipe him out of my book
34  go now lead the people to the place about which i have spoken to you
look my angel will go ahead of you and on the day when i make an accounting i will bring punishment on them for their sin
35  then jehovah began plaguing the people because they had made the calf the one that aaron had made
6  so jehovah said to moses now you will see what i will do to pharʹaoh
a mighty hand will force him to send them away and a mighty hand will force him to drive them out of his land
2  then god said to moses i am jehovah
3  and i used to appear to abraham isaac and jacob as god almighty but with regard to my name jehovah i did not make myself known to them
4  i also established my covenant with them to give them the land of caʹnaan the land in which they lived as foreigners
5  now i myself have heard the groaning of the people of israel whom the egyptians are enslaving and i remember my covenant
6  therefore say to the israelites i am jehovah and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and rescue you from their slavery and i will reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments
7  and i will take you in as my people and i will be your god and you will certainly know that i am jehovah your god who is bringing you out from under the burdens of egypt
8  and i will bring you into the land that i swore with an oath to give to abraham isaac and jacob and i will give it to you as something to possess
i am jehovah
9  moses later gave this message to the israelites but they did not listen to moses because of their discouragement and because of the harsh slavery
10  then jehovah spoke to moses saying
11  go in and tell pharʹaoh egypts king that he should send the israelites away out of his land
12  however moses replied to jehovah look the israelites have not listened to me how will pharʹaoh ever listen to me as i speak with difficulty
13  but jehovah again told moses and aaron what commands to give to the israelites and to pharʹaoh egypts king in order to bring the israelites out of the land of egypt
14  these are the heads of the house of their fathers the sons of reuʹben israels firstborn were haʹnoch palʹlu hezʹron and carʹmi
these are the families of reuʹben
15  the sons of simʹeon were jemuʹel jaʹmin oʹhad jaʹchin zoʹhar and shaʹul the son of a caʹnaanite woman
these are the families of simʹeon
16  these are the names of the sons of leʹvi according to their family descents gerʹshon koʹhath and merarʹi
the length of leʹvis life was 137 years
17  the sons of gerʹshon were libʹni and shimʹei according to their families
18  the sons of koʹhath were amʹram izʹhar hebʹron and uzʹziel
the length of koʹhaths life was 133 years
19  the sons of merarʹi were mahʹli and muʹshi
these were the families of the levites according to their family descents
20  now amʹram took jochʹebed his fathers sister as his wife
she bore him aaron and moses
the length of amʹrams life was 137 years
21  the sons of izʹhar were korʹah neʹpheg and zichʹri
22  the sons of uzʹziel were mishʹael elzaʹphan and sithʹri
23  now aaron took eliʹsheba amminʹadabs daughter the sister of nahʹshon as his wife
she bore him naʹdab abiʹhu eleaʹzar and ithʹamar
24  the sons of korʹah were asʹsir elkaʹnah and abiʹasaph
these were the families of the korʹahites
25  eleaʹzar aarons son took one of the daughters of puʹtiel as his wife
she bore him phinʹehas
these are the heads of the paternal houses of the levites according to their families
26  this is the aaron and moses to whom jehovah said bring the people of israel out of the land of egypt company by company
27  it was they who spoke to pharʹaoh egypts king to bring the people of israel out of egypt
it was this moses and aaron
28  on that day when jehovah spoke to moses in the land of egypt
29  jehovah told moses i am jehovah
speak to pharʹaoh king of egypt everything i am speaking to you
30  then moses said before jehovah look i speak with difficulty so how will pharʹaoh ever listen to me
31  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
2  see i have chosen bezʹalel the son of uʹri the son of hur of the tribe of judah
3  i will fill him with the spirit of god giving him wisdom understanding and knowledge of every kind of craftsmanship
4  for making artistic designs for working with gold silver and copper
5  for cutting and setting stones and for making every kind of wood product
6  moreover to assist him i have appointed ohoʹliab the son of ahisʹamach of the tribe of dan and i am putting wisdom into the heart of all those who are skillful so that they may make everything i have commanded you
7  the tent of meeting the ark of the testimony and the cover that is on it all the utensils of the tent
8  the table and its utensils the lampstand of pure gold and all its utensils the altar of incense
9  the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils the basin and its stand
10  the finely woven garments the holy garments for aaron the priest the garments of his sons to serve as priests
11  the anointing oil and the perfumed incense for the sanctuary
they will do everything i have commanded you
12  jehovah said further to moses
13  speak to the israelites and tell them especially you are to keep my sabbaths for it is a sign between me and you during your generations in order that you may know that i jehovah am sanctifying you
14  you must keep the sabbath for it is something holy to you
whoever profanes it must be put to death
if anyone does any work on it then that person must be cut off from among his people
15  six days work may be done but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest
it is something holy to jehovah
anyone doing work on the sabbath day must be put to death
16  the israelites must keep the sabbath they must observe the sabbath during all their generations
it is a lasting covenant
17  it is an enduring sign between me and the people of israel for in six days jehovah made the heavens and the earth and on the seventh day he rested and refreshed himself
18  now as soon as he had finished speaking with him on mount siʹnai he gave moses two tablets of the testimony tablets of stone written on by gods finger
21  these are the judicial decisions that you are to convey to them
2  if you buy a hebrew slave he will serve as a slave for six years but in the seventh year he will be set free without paying anything
3  if he came by himself he will go out by himself
if he is the husband of a wife then his wife must go out with him
4  if his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters the wife and her children will become her masters and he will go out by himself
5  but if the slave should insist and say i love my master my wife and my sons i do not want to be set free
6  his master must bring him before the true god
then he will bring him up against the door or the doorpost and his master will pierce his ear through with an awl and he will be his slave for life
7  if a man sells his daughter as a slave she will not go free the same way that a slave man does
8  if her master is not pleased with her and he does not designate her as a concubine but causes her to be purchased by someone else he will not be entitled to sell her to foreigners for he has betrayed her
9  if he selects her for his son he is to grant her the rights of a daughter
10  if he takes another wife for himself the sustenance the clothing and the marriage due of the first wife are not to be diminished
11  if he will not render these three things to her then she is to go free without paying any money
12  anyone who strikes a man so that he dies must be put to death
13  but if he does it unintentionally and the true god lets it happen i will designate for you a place where he can flee
14  if a man becomes very angry with his fellow man and he deliberately kills him the man must die even if you have to take him from my altar
15  one who strikes his father or his mother must be put to death
16  if anyone kidnaps a man and sells him or is caught holding him he must be put to death
17  anyone who curses his father or his mother must be put to death
18  this is what should happen if men quarrel and one strikes his fellow man with a stone or a fist and he does not die but is confined to his bed
19  if he is able to get up and walk around outdoors with the aid of a staff then the one who struck him must be free from punishment
he will only make compensation for the time the injured man lost from his work until he is completely healed
20  if a man strikes his slave man or his slave girl with a stick and that one dies by his hand that one must be avenged
21  however if he survives for one or two days he is not to be avenged because he is someone bought with his owners money
22  if men should struggle with each other and they hurt a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but no fatality results the offender must pay the damages imposed on him by the husband of the woman and he must pay it through the judges
23  but if a fatality does occur then you must give life for life
24  eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
25  burn for burn wound for wound blow for blow
26  if a man strikes the eye of his slave man or the eye of his slave girl and he destroys it he is to let the slave go free in compensation for his eye
27  and if he knocks out the tooth of his slave man or of his slave girl he is to let the slave go free in compensation for his tooth
28  if a bull gores a man or a woman and that one dies the bull must be stoned to death and its meat is not to be eaten but the owner of the bull is free from punishment
29  but if a bull was in the habit of goring and its owner had been warned but he would not keep it under guard and it killed a man or a woman the bull is to be stoned and its owner is also to be put to death
30  if a ransom is imposed on him he must give as the redemption price for his life all that may be imposed on him
31  whether it gored a son or a daughter it is to be done to the bulls owner according to this judicial decision
32  if the bull gored a slave man or a slave girl he will give the price of 30 shekels to that ones master and the bull will be stoned to death
33  if a man uncovers or digs a pit and does not cover it and a bull or a donkey falls into it
34  the owner of the pit is to make compensation
he is to pay the price to its owner and the dead animal will become his
35  if a mans bull hurts anothers bull and it dies then they must sell the live bull and divide the price paid for it they should also divide the dead animal
36  or if it was known that a bull had been in the habit of goring but its owner would not keep it under guard he must make compensation with bull for bull and the dead one will become his own

13  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
2  sanctify to me every firstborn male among the israelites
the first male to be born of both human and animal belongs to me
3  then moses said to the people remember this day on which you went out of egypt from the house of slavery because with a mighty hand jehovah brought you out of here
so nothing leavened may be eaten
4  you are going out on this day in the month of aʹbib
5  when jehovah has brought you into the land of the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the amʹorites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites which he swore to your forefathers to give you a land flowing with milk and honey then you must keep this observance in this month
6  seven days you are to eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day there will be a festival to jehovah
7  unleavened bread is to be eaten for the seven days and nothing leavened is to be found with you and no sourdough is to be found with you within all your territory
8  and you must tell your son on that day it is because of what jehovah did for me when i came out of egypt
9  and this will serve for you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial on your forehead so that jehovahs law may be in your mouth for with a mighty hand jehovah brought you out of egypt
10  you must keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year
11  when jehovah brings you into the land of the caʹnaanites which he has sworn to you and to your forefathers to give to you
12  you must devote to jehovah every firstborn male as well as every male firstling of the livestock that you acquire
the males belong to jehovah
13  every firstling donkey you are to redeem with a sheep and if you do not redeem it then you must break its neck
and every firstborn male of your sons you are to redeem
14  in case your son should ask you later on what does this mean then you should say to him with a mighty hand jehovah brought us out of egypt from the house of slavery
15  when pharʹaoh stubbornly refused to send us away jehovah killed every firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast
that is why i am sacrificing to jehovah all the firstborn males and i redeem every firstborn of my sons
16  this must serve as a sign on your hand and as a headband on your forehead for with a mighty hand jehovah brought us out of egypt
17  now when pharʹaoh sent the people away god did not lead them by the way of the land of the philisʹtines although it was near
for god said the people may change their minds when they are confronted by war and will return to egypt
18  so god made the people go around by the way of the wilderness of the red sea
but it was in battle formation that the israelites went up out of the land of egypt
19  moses also took josephs bones with him because joseph had made the sons of israel solemnly swear god will not fail to turn his attention to you and you must take my bones up out of here with you
20  they departed from sucʹcoth and encamped at eʹtham at the edge of the wilderness
21  now jehovah was going ahead of them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light so that they could travel by day and by night
22  the pillar of cloud would not move away from before the people during the day nor the pillar of fire at night
14  jehovah now said to moses
2  tell the israelites that they should turn back and encamp before pihahiʹroth between migʹdol and the sea within view of baʹalzeʹphon
you are to encamp facing it by the sea
3  then pharʹaoh will say about the israelites they are wandering in confusion in the land
the wilderness has closed in on them
4  i will allow pharʹaohs heart to become obstinate and he will chase after them and i will glorify myself by means of pharʹaoh and all his army and the egyptians will certainly know that i am jehovah
so that is what they did
5  later it was reported to the king of egypt that the people had run away
immediately pharʹaoh and his servants had a change of heart regarding the people and they said why did we do this and release israel from serving as slaves for us
6  so he made his war chariots ready and he took his people with him
7  he took 600 chosen chariots and all the other chariots of egypt with warriors on every one of them
8  thus jehovah allowed the heart of pharʹaoh king of egypt to become obstinate and he chased after the israelites while the israelites were going out with confidence
9  the egyptians chased after them and all the chariot horses of pharʹaoh and his cavalrymen and his army were catching up with them while they were camping by the sea by pihahiʹroth facing baʹalzeʹphon
10  when pharʹaoh got closer the israelites raised their eyes and saw the egyptians pursuing them
the israelites became terrified and began to cry out to jehovah
11  they said to moses is it because there are no burial places in egypt that you have brought us here to die in the wilderness what have you done to us by leading us out of egypt
12  is this not the very thing we told you in egypt when we said let us alone so that we may serve the egyptians for it is better for us to serve the egyptians than to die in the wilderness
13  then moses said to the people do not be afraid
stand firm and see the salvation of jehovah that he will perform for you today
for the egyptians whom you see today you will never ever see again
14  jehovah himself will fight for you and you will keep silent
15  jehovah now said to moses why do you keep crying out to me tell the israelites that they should break camp
16  as for you lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it so that the israelites may go through the midst of the sea on dry ground
17  as for me i am allowing the hearts of the egyptians to become obstinate so that they will go in after them thus i will glorify myself by means of pharʹaoh and all his army his war chariots and his cavalrymen
18  and the egyptians will certainly know that i am jehovah when i glorify myself by means of pharʹaoh his war chariots and his cavalrymen
19  then the angel of the true god who was going ahead of the camp of israel departed and went to their rear and the pillar of cloud that was in front of them moved to the rear and stood behind them
20  so it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel
on the one side it was a dark cloud
on the other side it was lighting up the night
so the one camp did not come near the other camp all night long
21  moses now stretched out his hand over the sea and jehovah drove the sea back with a strong east wind all night long turning the sea basin into dry ground and the waters divided
22  so the israelites went through the midst of the sea on dry ground while the waters formed a wall on their right hand and on their left
23  the egyptians pursued them and all pharʹaohs horses his war chariots and his cavalrymen began going after them into the midst of the sea
24  during the morning watch jehovah looked at the camp of the egyptians from within the pillar of fire and cloud and he threw the camp of the egyptians into confusion
25  he kept taking wheels off their chariots so that they were driving them with difficulty and the egyptians were saying let us flee from any contact with israel because jehovah is fighting for them against the egyptians
26  then jehovah said to moses stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the egyptians their war chariots and their cavalrymen
27  moses at once stretched out his hand over the sea and as morning approached the sea returned to its normal condition
as the egyptians fled from it jehovah shook the egyptians off into the midst of the sea
28  the returning waters covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen and all of pharʹaohs army who had gone into the sea after them
not so much as one among them was allowed to survive
29  but the israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the seabed and the waters formed a wall on their right hand and on their left
30  thus jehovah saved israel on that day from the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead on the seashore
31  israel also saw the great power that jehovah wielded against the egyptians and the people began to fear jehovah and to put faith in jehovah and in his servant moses
29  this is what you are to do to sanctify them to serve as priests to me take a young bull two unblemished rams
2  unleavened bread unleavened ringshaped loaves mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil
you are to make them with fine wheat flour
3  and put them in a basket and present them in the basket along with the bull and the two rams
4  you will present aaron and his sons at the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water
5  then you are to take the garments and clothe aaron with the robe the sleeveless coat of the ephʹod the ephʹod and the breastpiece and you are to tie the woven belt of the ephʹod securely around his waist
6  you will put the turban on his head and put the holy sign of dedication on the turban
7  and take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him
8  then bring his sons forward and clothe them with the robes
9  and wrap the sashes around them aaron as well as his sons and put on their headgear and the priesthood will become theirs as a permanent statute
this is how you should install aaron and his sons to serve as priests
10  you are now to present the bull before the tent of meeting and aaron and his sons will lay their hands on the bulls head
11  slaughter the bull before jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting
12  take some of the bulls blood on your finger and put it on the horns of the altar and pour out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar
13  then take all the fat that covers the intestines the appendage on the liver and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them and burn them so that they smoke on the altar
14  but the bulls flesh and its skin and its dung you will burn with fire outside the camp
it is a sin offering
15  then take the one ram and aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on the rams head
16  slaughter the ram and take its blood and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar
17  cut the ram into its pieces and wash its intestines and its shanks and arrange the pieces together with its head
18  you must burn the entire ram making it smoke on the altar

19  next you are to take the other ram and aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on the rams head
20  slaughter the ram and take some of its blood and put it on aarons right earlobe and on his sons right earlobe and on the thumb of their right hand and the big toe of their right foot and sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar
21  then take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil and spatter it on aaron and his garments and on his sons and his sons garments so that he and his garments and his sons and their garments may be holy
22  then take from the ram the fat the fat tail the fat that covers the intestines the appendage of the liver the two kidneys and the fat that is on them and the right leg for it is a ram of installation
23  take also a round loaf of bread and a ringshaped loaf of oiled bread and a wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before jehovah
24  you must place them all in the hands of aaron and in the hands of his sons and you are to wave them back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah
25  then you will take them out of their hands and burn them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as a pleasing aroma before jehovah
it is an offering made by fire to jehovah
26  then take the breast of the ram of installation which is offered in behalf of aaron and wave it back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah and it will become your portion
27  you are to sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion that was waved and that was taken from the ram of installation from what was offered for aaron and for his sons
28  it is to become aarons and his sons by a permanent regulation to be carried out by the israelites for it is a sacred portion and it will become a sacred portion to be given by the israelites
it is their sacred portion for jehovah from their communion sacrifices
29  the holy garments that belong to aaron will be used by his sons after him when they are anointed and installed as priests
30  the priest from among his sons who succeeds him and who comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place will wear them for seven days
31  you will take the ram of installation and boil its flesh in a holy place
32  aaron and his sons will eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance of the tent of meeting
33  they are to eat the things with which atonement was made to install them as priests and to sanctify them
but an unauthorized person may not eat them for they are something holy
34  if any of the flesh of the installation sacrifice and of the bread is left over until the morning then you must burn what is left with fire
it must not be eaten for it is something holy
35  you are to do this way to aaron and his sons according to all that i have commanded you
you will take seven days to install them as priests
36  you will offer the bull of the sin offering daily for an atonement and you are to purify the altar from sin by making atonement for it and you must anoint it to sanctify it
37  you will take seven days to make atonement for the altar and you must sanctify it so that it may become a most holy altar
anyone who touches the altar is to be holy
38  this is what you will offer on the altar two oneyearold rams each day continually
39  offer the one young ram in the morning and the other ram at twilight
40  a tenth part of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil and a drink offering of a fourth of a hin of wine will go for the first young ram
41  you will offer the second young ram at twilight along with the same grain and drink offerings as in the morning
you will render it as a pleasing aroma an offering made by fire to jehovah
42  it is to be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before jehovah where i will present myself to you to speak to you there
43  i will present myself there to the israelites and it will be sanctified by my glory
44  i will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar and i will sanctify aaron and his sons so that they may serve as priests to me
45  i will reside among the people of israel and i will be their god
46  and they will certainly know that i am jehovah their god who brought them out of the land of egypt so that i may reside among them
i am jehovah their god
40  then jehovah said to moses
2  on the first day of the first month you are to set up the tabernacle the tent of meeting
3  place the ark of the testimony in it and screen off the ark with the curtain
4  you are to bring the table in and arrange the things that belong on it and bring in the lampstand and light its lamps
5  then put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony and put the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle in place
6  you are to put the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle the tent of meeting
7  and place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it
8  then set up the courtyard around it and put up the screen for the entrance of the courtyard
9  next you are to take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it and sanctify it and all its utensils so that it will become something holy
10  you are to anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and sanctify the altar so that it will become a most holy altar
11  and anoint the basin and its stand and sanctify it
12  then bring aaron and his sons near to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water
13  and you are to clothe aaron with the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him and he will serve as priest to me
14  after that bring his sons near and clothe them with robes
15  you are to anoint them just as you anointed their father so that they will serve as priests to me and their anointing will serve continually for them as a lasting priesthood during their generations
16  moses did according to all that jehovah had commanded him
he did just so
17  in the first month in the second year on the first day of the month the tabernacle was set up
18  when moses set up the tabernacle he put its socket pedestals down set up the panel frames put its bars in and set up its pillars
19  he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and placed the covering of the tent over it just as jehovah had commanded moses
20  after that he took the testimony and put it into the ark and placed the poles on the ark and put the cover on the ark
21  he brought the ark into the tabernacle and put the curtain of the screen in place and screened off the ark of the testimony just as jehovah had commanded moses
22  next he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain
23  and he arranged the row of bread on it before jehovah just as jehovah had commanded moses
24  he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting in front of the table on the south side of the tabernacle
25  he lit the lamps before jehovah just as jehovah had commanded moses
26  he next placed the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the curtain
27  in order to make perfumed incense smoke on it just as jehovah had commanded moses
28  then he put the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle in place
29  he placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle the tent of meeting so that he might offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on it just as jehovah had commanded moses
30  he then placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing
31  moses and aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet at it
32  whenever they went into the tent of meeting or approached the altar they would wash just as jehovah had commanded moses
33  finally he set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar and put up the screen for the entrance of the courtyard
so moses finished the work
34  and the cloud began to cover the tent of meeting and jehovahs glory filled the tabernacle
35  moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting because the cloud remained over it and jehovahs glory filled the tabernacle
36  and when the cloud lifted from the tabernacle the israelites would break camp during all stages of their journey
37  however if the cloud did not lift up then they would not break camp until the day it lifted
38  for jehovahs cloud was over the tabernacle by day and a fire remained over it by night in the sight of all the house of israel during all stages of their journey
39  from the blue thread the purple wool and the scarlet material they made finely woven garments for ministering in the holy place
they made the holy garments that were for aaron just as jehovah had commanded moses
2  he made the ephʹod of gold blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine twisted linen
3  they hammered plates of gold into thin sheets and he cut it into threads to work in with the blue thread the purple wool the scarlet material and the fine linen and it was embroidered
4  they made shoulder pieces for it that were attached and it was joined to them at its two edges
5  and the woven belt which was attached to the ephʹod for tying it securely in position was made of the same material of gold blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine twisted linen just as jehovah had commanded moses
6  then they mounted the onyx stones in gold settings and they engraved them with the names of the sons of israel as they would engrave a seal
7  he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephʹod as memorial stones for the sons of israel just as jehovah had commanded moses
8  then he made the breastpiece with the workmanship of an embroiderer like the workmanship of the ephʹod out of gold blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine twisted linen
9  it was square when doubled
they made the breastpiece which when doubled was as long and as wide as the span of the hand
10  they set four rows of stones in it
the first row was ruby topaz and emerald
11  the second row was turquoise sapphire and jasper
12  the third row was leshʹem stone agate and amethyst
13  and the fourth row was chrysʹolite onyx and jade
they were mounted in settings of gold
14  the stones corresponded to the names of the 12 sons of israel and the names were engraved like a seal each name representing one of the 12 tribes
15  then they made wreathed chains on the breastpiece like cords of pure gold
16  and they made two settings of gold and two rings of gold and attached the two rings to the two corners of the breastpiece
17  after that they put the two cords of gold through the two rings at the corners of the breastpiece
18  then they put the two ends of the two cords through the two settings and attached them to the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephʹod
19  next they made two rings of gold and set them at the two ends on the inside edge of the breastpiece facing the ephʹod
20  then they made two more rings of gold and put them on the front of the ephʹod below the two shoulder pieces close to where it is joined above the woven belt of the ephʹod
21  finally they tied the breastpiece with a blue cord from its rings to the rings of the ephʹod in order to keep the breastpiece in its place on the ephʹod above the woven belt just as jehovah had commanded moses
22  then he made the sleeveless coat of the ephʹod woven by a loom worker all of blue thread
23  the opening of the sleeveless coat was in the middle of it like the opening of a coat of mail
its opening had a border around it so that it would not be torn
24  next they made on the hem of the sleeveless coat pomegranates of blue thread purple wool and scarlet material twisted together
25  and they made bells of pure gold and put the bells in between the pomegranates all around the hem of the sleeveless coat in between the pomegranates
26  they alternated a bell and a pomegranate a bell and a pomegranate all around the hem of the sleeveless coat which was used for ministering just as jehovah had commanded moses
27  and they made the robes of fine linen woven by a loom worker for aaron and his sons
28  and the turban of fine linen the ornamental headgear of fine linen the linen shorts of fine twisted linen
29  and the sash of fine twisted linen blue thread purple wool and scarlet material woven together just as jehovah had commanded moses
30  finally they made the shining plate the holy sign of dedication out of pure gold and inscribed on it an inscription as one would engrave a seal holiness belongs to jehovah
31  they attached to it a cord made from blue thread in order to put it on the turban just as jehovah had commanded moses
32  so all the work for the tabernacle the tent of meeting was completed and the israelites did everything that jehovah had commanded moses
they did just so
33  then they brought the tabernacle to moses the tent and all its utensils its clasps its panel frames its bars and its pillars and its socket pedestals
34  its covering of ram skins dyed red its covering of sealskins the curtain for the screen
35  the ark of the testimony and its poles and the cover
36  the table all its utensils and the showbread
37  the lampstand of pure gold its lamps the row of lamps and all its utensils and the oil for lighting
38  the altar of gold the anointing oil the perfumed incense the screen for the entrance of the tent
39  the altar of copper and its grating of copper its poles all its utensils the basin and its stand
40  the hanging curtains of the courtyard its pillars and its socket pedestals the screen for the entrance of the courtyard its tent cords and its tent pins and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle for the tent of meeting
41  the finely woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons for serving as priests
42  according to all that jehovah had commanded moses that was how the israelites did all the work
43  when moses inspected all their work he saw that they had done it just as jehovah had commanded and moses blessed them
19  in the third month after the israelites went out of the land of egypt on the same day they came to the wilderness of siʹnai
2  they pulled away from rephʹidim and came to the wilderness of siʹnai and camped in the wilderness
israel camped there in front of the mountain
3  then moses went up to the true god and jehovah called to him from the mountain saying this is what you are to say to the house of jacob and to tell the israelites
4  you have seen for yourselves what i did to the egyptians in order to carry you on wings of eagles and bring you to myself
5  now if you will strictly obey my voice and keep my covenant you will certainly become my special property out of all peoples for the whole earth belongs to me
6  you will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation
these are the words that you are to say to the israelites
7  so moses went and summoned the elders of the people and declared to them all these words that jehovah had commanded him
8  after that all the people answered unanimously all that jehovah has spoken we are willing to do
moses immediately took the peoples response to jehovah
9  and jehovah said to moses look i am coming to you in a dark cloud so that the people may hear when i speak with you and so that they may always put faith in you as well
then moses reported the words of the people to jehovah
10  then jehovah said to moses go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and they must wash their clothing
11  and they must be ready for the third day because on the third day jehovah will come down upon mount siʹnai before the eyes of all the people
12  you must set boundaries for the people all around it and tell them beware of going up to the mountain or touching its border
anybody touching the mountain will surely be put to death
13  no hand is to touch him but he will either be stoned or be shot through
whether beast or man he will not live
but at the sound of the rams horn they may come up to the mountain
14  then moses went down from the mountain to the people and he began to sanctify the people and they washed their clothing
15  he said to the people get ready for the third day
abstain from sexual relations
16  on the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning and there was a heavy cloud on the mountain and a very loud sound of a horn and all the people in the camp began to tremble
17  moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the true god and they took their place at the base of the mountain
18  mount siʹnai smoked all over because jehovah came down upon it in fire and its smoke was rising like the smoke of a kiln and the whole mountain was trembling violently
19  as the sound of the horn grew louder and louder moses spoke and the voice of the true god answered him
20  so jehovah came down upon mount siʹnai to the top of the mountain
then jehovah called moses to the top of the mountain and moses went up
21  jehovah now said to moses go down and warn the people not to try to force their way through to look at jehovah or many of them will perish
22  and let the priests who regularly come near to jehovah sanctify themselves so that jehovah may not strike them
23  moses then said to jehovah the people are not able to come up to mount siʹnai because you already warned us saying set boundaries around the mountain and make it sacred
24  however jehovah said to him go descend and come back up you and aaron with you but do not let the priests and the people force their way through to come up to jehovah so that he may not strike them
25  so moses descended to the people and told them
24  then he said to moses go up to jehovah you and aaron naʹdab and abiʹhu and 70 of the elders of israel and bow down from a distance
2  moses should approach jehovah by himself but the others should not approach and the people should not go up with him
3  then moses came and related to the people all the words of jehovah and all the judicial decisions and all the people answered with one voice all the words that jehovah has spoken we are willing to do
4  so moses wrote down all the words of jehovah
then he got up early in the morning and built at the foot of the mountain an altar and 12 pillars corresponding to the 12 tribes of israel
5  after that he sent young israelite men and they offered up burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as communion sacrifices to jehovah
6  then moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar
7  then he took the book of the covenant and read it aloud to the people
and they said all that jehovah has spoken we are willing to do and we will be obedient
8  so moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said this is the blood of the covenant that jehovah has made with you in harmony with all these words
9  moses and aaron naʹdab and abiʹhu and 70 of the elders of israel went up
10  and they saw the god of israel
under his feet was what seemed like a sapphire pavement and it was as pure as the heavens themselves
11  he did not harm the distinguished men of israel and they saw a vision of the true god and ate and drank
12  jehovah now said to moses come up to me on the mountain and stay there
i will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment that i will write for their instruction
13  so moses got up with his attendant joshua and moses went up the mountain of the true god
14  but to the elders he had said wait here for us until we return to you
you have aaron and hur with you
whoever has a legal case may go to them
15  then moses went up the mountain while the cloud was covering it
16  jehovahs glory remained on mount siʹnai and the cloud covered it for six days
on the seventh day he called to moses from the midst of the cloud
17  to the israelites who were watching the appearance of jehovahs glory was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop
18  moses then entered into the cloud and went up the mountain
and moses stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights
5  afterward moses and aaron went in and said to pharʹaoh this is what jehovah the god of israel says send my people away so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness
2  but pharʹaoh said who is jehovah that i should obey his voice to send israel away i do not know jehovah at all and what is more i will not send israel away
3  but they said the god of the hebrews has communicated with us
please we want to make a threeday journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to jehovah our god otherwise he will strike us with disease or with the sword
4  the king of egypt replied to them why is it moses and aaron that you are taking the people away from their work return to your labor
5  and pharʹaoh continued look at how many people of the land there are and you would have them rest from their labor
6  that same day pharʹaoh commanded the taskmasters and their foremen
7  you must no longer give straw to the people to make bricks
let them go and gather straw for themselves
8  but you must still impose on them the same quota of bricks as they made in the past
do not reduce it for them for they are relaxing
that is why they are crying out we want to go we want to sacrifice to our god
9  make them work harder and keep them busy so that they will not pay attention to lies
10  so the taskmasters and their foremen went out and said to the people here is what pharʹaoh has said i am giving you no more straw
11  go and get your own straw for yourselves wherever you can find it but your work will not be reduced at all
12  then the people scattered throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble for straw
13  and the taskmasters kept urging them you must each finish your work every day just as when straw was provided
14  also the foremen of the israelites whom pharʹaohs taskmasters had appointed over them were beaten
they asked them why did you not reach the quota of bricks that you used to make it happened both yesterday and today
15  so the foremen of the israelites went in and complained to pharʹaoh why are you treating your servants this way
16  no straw is given to your servants yet they are saying to us make bricks your servants are beaten but your own people are at fault
17  but he said you are relaxing you are relaxing that is why you are saying we want to go we want to sacrifice to jehovah
18  so now go get back to work no straw will be given to you but you must still produce your quota of bricks
19  then the foremen of the israelites saw that they were in serious trouble because of the order you must not reduce your daily quota of bricks at all
20  after that they met up with moses and aaron who were standing there to meet them as they came out from pharʹaoh
21  at once they said to them may jehovah look upon you and judge since you have made pharʹaoh and his servants despise us and you have put a sword in their hand to kill us
22  then moses turned to jehovah and said jehovah why have you afflicted this people why have you sent me
23  from the time that i went in before pharʹaoh to speak in your name he has dealt worse with this people and you have certainly not rescued your people
36  bezʹalel will work along with ohoʹliab and every skilled man to whom jehovah has given wisdom and understanding so as to know how to do all the work of the holy service just as jehovah has commanded
2  moses then called bezʹalel and ohoʹliab and every skilled man into whose heart jehovah had put wisdom everyone whose heart impelled him to volunteer to do the work
3  then they took from moses all the contribution that the israelites had brought for the work of the holy service
however these continued to bring him voluntary offerings morning after morning
4  then after they started the holy work all the skilled workers were coming one after another
5  and they were telling moses the people are bringing much more than what is required for the work that jehovah has commanded to be done
6  so moses commanded that an announcement be made throughout the camp saying men and women do not bring any more goods for the holy contribution
with that the people were restrained from bringing in anything else
7  the goods were enough for all the work to be done and more than enough
8  so all the skilled workers made the tabernacle of ten tent cloths of fine twisted linen blue thread purple wool and scarlet material he made them with cherubs embroidered on them
9  each tent cloth was 28 cubits long and 4 cubits wide
all the tent cloths were the same size
10  then he joined five of the tent cloths together and the other five tent cloths he joined together
11  after that he made loops of blue thread on the edge of the one tent cloth where it would join
he did the same on the edge of the outermost tent cloth at the corresponding place where it would join
12  he made 50 loops on the one tent cloth and 50 loops on the other edge of the tent cloth at the place where it would join so that the loops would be opposite one another
13  finally he made 50 gold clasps and joined the tent cloths together with the clasps so that the tabernacle became one unit
14  then he made tent cloths of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle
he made 11 tent cloths
15  each tent cloth was 30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide
the 11 tent cloths were the same size
16  then he joined five of the tent cloths together and he joined the other six tent cloths together
17  next he made 50 loops along the edge of the outermost tent cloth where it joined and he made 50 loops along the edge of the other tent cloth that joined with it
18  and he made 50 copper clasps for joining the tent together to become one unit
19  he made a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red and a covering out of sealskins to go over that
20  then he made out of acacia wood the tabernacles panel frames which stood upright
21  each panel frame was ten cubits high and one and a half cubits wide
22  each panel frame had two tenons joined to each other
that is how he made all the panel frames of the tabernacle
23  thus he made the panel frames for the south side of the tabernacle 20 panel frames facing south
24  then he made 40 socket pedestals of silver to go under the 20 panel frames two socket pedestals beneath one panel frame for its two tenons and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame for its two tenons
25  for the other side of the tabernacle the northern side he made 20 panel frames
26  and their 40 socket pedestals of silver two socket pedestals beneath the one panel frame and two socket pedestals beneath each of the other panel frames
27  for the rear section of the tabernacle to the west he made six panel frames
28  he made two panel frames as corner posts of the tabernacle at the two rear corners
29  the posts were doubled from the bottom to the top up to the first ring
that is what he did with the two corner posts
30  so they amounted to eight panel frames along with their 16 socket pedestals of silver two socket pedestals under each panel frame
31  then he made bars of acacia wood five bars for the panel frames of the one side of the tabernacle
32  and five bars for the panel frames of the other side of the tabernacle and five for the panel frames of the tabernacle for the rear section to the west
33  then he made the middle bar to extend along the middle of the panel frames from one end to the other
34  he overlaid the panel frames with gold and he made their rings of gold as holders for the bars and he overlaid the bars with gold
35  then he made a curtain of blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine twisted linen
he made it with cherubs embroidered on it
36  then he made for it four acacia pillars and overlaid them with gold along with hooks of gold and cast four socket pedestals of silver for them
37  next he made a screen for the entrance of the tent out of blue thread purple wool scarlet material and fine twisted linen woven together
38  as well as its five pillars and their hooks
he overlaid their tops and their connectors with gold but their five socket pedestals were of copper
15  at that time moses and the israelites sang this song to jehovah let me sing to jehovah for he has become highly exalted
the horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea
2  my strength and my might is jah since he has become my salvation
this is my god and i will praise him my fathers god and i will exalt him
3  jehovah is a powerful warrior
jehovah is his name
4  pharʹaohs chariots and his army he has cast into the seaand his finest warriors have sunk into the red sea
5  the surging waters covered them down into the depths they sank like a stone
6  your right hand o jehovah is great in poweryour right hand o jehovah can shatter an enemy
7  in your great majesty you can throw down those who rise up against youyou send out your burning anger it eats them up like stubble
8  by a breath from your nostrils waters massed togetherthey stood still holding back the floodsthe surging waters congealed in the heart of the sea
9  the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide spoil until i am satisfied i will draw my sword my hand will subdue them
10  you blew with your breath the sea covered themthey sank like lead in majestic waters
11  who among the gods is like you o jehovah who is like you showing yourself mighty in holiness the one to be feared with songs of praise the one doing wonders
12  you stretched out your right hand and the earth swallowed them up
13  in your loyal love you have led the people whom you have redeemedin your strength you will guide them to your holy place of dwelling
14  peoples must hear they will shudderanguish will seize the inhabitants of philisʹtia
15  at that time the sheikhs of eʹdom will be terrifiedand trembling will take hold of the mighty rulers of moʹab
all the inhabitants of caʹnaan will be disheartened
16  fear and dread will fall upon them
because of the greatness of your arm they will be as motionless as a stoneuntil your people pass by o jehovahuntil the people whom you produced pass by
17  you will bring them and plant them in the mountain of your inheritancethe established place that you have prepared for yourself to inhabit o jehovaha sanctuary o jehovah that your hands have established
18  jehovah will rule as king forever and ever
19  when pharʹaohs horses with his war chariots and his cavalrymen went into the seathen jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon thembut the people of israel walked on dry ground through the midst of the sea
20  then mirʹiam the prophetess aarons sister took a tambourine in her hand and all the women followed her with tambourines and with dances
21  mirʹiam sang in response to the men sing to jehovah for he has become highly exalted
the horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea
22  moses later led israel away from the red sea and they went out to the wilderness of shur and marched on for three days in the wilderness but they did not find water
23  they came to maʹrah but they were not able to drink the water from maʹrah because it was bitter
that is why he named it maʹrah
24  so the people began to murmur against moses saying what are we to drink
25  he cried out to jehovah and jehovah directed him to a tree
when he threw it into the water the water became sweet
there he established for them a regulation and a case for judgment and there he put them to the test
26  he said if you will strictly listen to the voice of jehovah your god and will do what is right in his eyes and will pay attention to his commandments and keep all his regulations i will not bring upon you any of the diseases that i brought upon the egyptians for i jehovah am healing you
27  after that they came to eʹlim where there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees
so they camped there by the water
20  then god spoke all these words
2  i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt out of the house of slavery
3  you must not have any other gods besides me
4  you must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth
5  you must not bow down to them nor be enticed to serve them for i jehovah your god am a god who requires exclusive devotion bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me
6  but showing loyal love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments
7  you must not take up the name of jehovah your god in a worthless way for jehovah will not leave unpunished the one who takes up his name in a worthless way
8  remember the sabbath day to keep it sacred
9  you are to labor and do all your work for six days
10  but the seventh day is a sabbath to jehovah your god
you must not do any work neither you nor your son nor your daughter nor your slave man nor your slave girl nor your domestic animal nor your foreign resident who is inside your settlements
11  for in six days jehovah made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them and he began to rest on the seventh day
that is why jehovah blessed the sabbath day and made it sacred
12  honor your father and your mother so that you may live a long time in the land that jehovah your god is giving you
13  you must not murder
14  you must not commit adultery
15  you must not steal
16  you must not testify falsely when you are a witness against your fellow man
17  you must not desire your fellow mans house
you must not desire your fellow mans wife nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his donkey nor anything that belongs to your fellow man
18  now all the people were witnessing the thunder and lightning the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking and seeing this made them tremble and stand at a distance
19  so they said to moses you speak with us and we will listen but do not let god speak with us for fear that we will die
20  so moses said to the people do not be afraid for the true god has come to put you to the test in order that the fear of him may continue with you so that you may not sin
21  so the people kept standing at a distance but moses went near to the dark cloud where the true god was
22  then jehovah said to moses this is what you are to say to the israelites you have seen for yourselves that i spoke with you from heaven
23  you must not make gods of silver alongside me and you must not make gods of gold for yourselves
24  an altar of earth you are to make for me and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings your communion sacrifices your flock and your herd
in every place where i cause my name to be remembered i will come to you and i will bless you
25  if you make an altar of stones for me you must not build it using stones cut with tools
for if you do use your chisel on it you will profane it
26  and you must not go up by steps to my altar that your private parts may not be exposed upon it
1  now these are the names of israels sons who came into egypt with jacob each man who came with his household
2  reuʹben simʹeon leʹvi and judah
3  isʹsachar zebʹulun and benjamin
4  dan and naphʹtali gad and ashʹer
5  and all those who were born to jacob were 70 people but joseph was already in egypt
6  joseph eventually died and also all his brothers and all that generation
7  and the israelites became fruitful and began to increase greatly and they kept on multiplying and growing mightier at an extraordinary rate so that the land became filled with them
8  in time there arose over egypt a new king one who did not know joseph
9  so he said to his people look the people of israel are more numerous and mightier than we are
10  let us deal shrewdly with them
otherwise they will continue to multiply and if a war breaks out they will join our enemies and fight against us and leave the country
11  so they appointed chiefs of forced labor over them to oppress them with hard labor and they built storage cities for pharʹaoh namely piʹthom and raamʹses
12  but the more they would oppress them the more they would multiply and the more they kept spreading out so they felt sick with fear because of the israelites
13  consequently the egyptians forced the israelites into harsh slavery
14  they made their life bitter with hard labor as they worked with clay mortar and bricks and in every form of slavery in the field
yes they made them toil in harsh conditions in every form of slavery
15  later the king of egypt spoke to the hebrew midwives whose names were shiphʹrah and puʹah
16  and he told them when you help the hebrew women to give birth and you see them on the stool for childbirth you must put the child to death if it is a son but if it is a daughter she must live
17  however the midwives feared the true god and they did not do what the king of egypt told them
instead they would keep the male children alive
18  in time the king of egypt called the midwives and said to them why have you kept the male children alive
19  the midwives said to pharʹaoh the hebrew women are not like the egyptian women
they are lively and have already given birth before the midwife can come in to them
20  so god dealt well with the midwives and the people kept increasing and becoming very mighty
21  and because the midwives had feared the true god he later gave them families
22  finally pharʹaoh commanded all his people you are to throw every newborn son of the hebrews into the nile river but you are to keep every daughter alive
2  about that time a certain man of the house of leʹvi married a daughter of leʹvi
2  and the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son
when she saw how beautiful he was she kept him concealed for three months
3  when she was no longer able to conceal him she took a papyrus basket and coated it with bitumen and pitch and put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the bank of the nile river
4  but his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him
5  when pharʹaohs daughter came down to bathe in the nile her female attendants were walking by the side of the nile
and she caught sight of the basket in the middle of the reeds
she immediately sent her slave girl to get it
6  when she opened it she saw the child and the boy was crying
she felt compassion for him but she said this is one of the children of the hebrews
7  then his sister said to pharʹaohs daughter shall i go and call a nursing woman from the hebrews to nurse the child for you
8  pharʹaohs daughter said to her go at once the girl went and called the childs mother
9  pharʹaohs daughter then said to her take this child with you and nurse him for me and i will pay you
so the woman took the child and nursed him
10  when the child grew older she brought him to pharʹaohs daughter and he became a son to her
she named him moses and said it is because i have drawn him out of the water
11  now in those days after moses had become an adult he went out to his brothers to look at the burdens they were bearing and he caught sight of an egyptian beating a hebrew one of his brothers
12  so he looked this way and that and seeing no one he killed the egyptian and hid him in the sand
13  but he went out on the following day and there were two hebrew men fighting with each other
so he said to the one in the wrong why do you strike your companion
14  at this he said who appointed you as a prince and a judge over us are you planning to kill me just as you killed the egyptian moses now was afraid and said surely the matter has become known
15  then pharʹaoh heard about it and he attempted to kill moses but moses ran away from pharʹaoh and went to dwell in the land of midʹian and he sat down by a well
16  now the priest of midʹian had seven daughters and these came to draw water and to fill the troughs to water their fathers flock
17  but as usual the shepherds came and drove them away
at this moses got up and helped the women and watered their flock
18  when they came home to their father reuʹel he exclaimed how is it that you have come home so quickly today
19  they replied a certain egyptian rescued us from the shepherds and he even drew water for us and watered the flock
20  he said to his daughters but where is he why did you leave the man behind call him so that he may eat with us
21  after that moses consented to stay with the man and he gave his daughter zippoʹrah to moses in marriage
22  later she bore a son and he named him gerʹshom for he said i have become a foreign resident in a foreign land
23  after a long time the king of egypt died but the israelites continued to groan because of the slavery and to cry out in complaint and their cry for help because of the slavery kept going up to the true god
24  in time god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob
25  so god looked on the israelites and god took notice
3  moses became a shepherd of the flock of his fatherinlaw jethʹro the priest of midʹian
while he was leading the flock to the west side of the wilderness he eventually came to the mountain of the true god to hoʹreb
2  then jehovahs angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thornbush
as he kept looking he saw that the thornbush was on fire and yet the thornbush was not consumed
3  so moses said i will go over to inspect this unusual sight to see why the thornbush does not burn up
4  when jehovah saw that he went over to look god called to him out of the thornbush and said moses moses to which he said here i am
5  then he said do not come any nearer
remove your sandals from your feet because the place where you are standing is holy ground
6  he went on to say i am the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
then moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at the true god
7  jehovah added i have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in egypt and i have heard their outcry because of those who force them to work i well know the pains they suffer
8  i will go down to rescue them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and spacious a land flowing with milk and honey the territory of the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the amʹorites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites
9  now look the outcry of the people of israel has reached me and i have seen also the harsh way that the egyptians are oppressing them
10  now come i will send you to pharʹaoh and you will bring my people the israelites out of egypt
11  however moses said to the true god who am i that i should go to pharʹaoh and bring the israelites out of egypt
12  to this he said i will prove to be with you and this is the sign for you that it was i who sent you after you have brought the people out of egypt you people will serve the true god on this mountain
13  but moses said to the true god suppose i go to the israelites and say to them the god of your forefathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what should i say to them
14  so god said to moses i will become what i choose to become
and he added this is what you are to say to the israelites i will become has sent me to you
15  then god said once more to moses this is what you are to say to the israelites jehovah the god of your forefathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has sent me to you
this is my name forever and this is how i am to be remembered from generation to generation
16  now go and gather the elders of israel and say to them jehovah the god of your forefathers has appeared to me the god of abraham isaac and jacob and he said i have certainly taken notice of you and of what is being done to you in egypt
17  so i say i will take you away from affliction at the hands of the egyptians to the land of the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the amʹorites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites to a land flowing with milk and honey
18  they will certainly listen to your voice and you will go you and the elders of israel to the king of egypt and you men should say to him jehovah the god of the hebrews has communicated with us
so please let us make a threeday journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to jehovah our god
19  but i myself well know that the king of egypt will not give you permission to go unless a mighty hand compels him
20  so i will have to stretch out my hand and strike egypt with all my extraordinary acts that i will do in it and after that he will send you out
21  and i will give this people favor in the eyes of the egyptians and when you go you will by no means go emptyhanded
22  each woman must ask her neighbor and the woman lodging in her house for articles of silver and of gold as well as clothing and you will put them on your sons and your daughters and you will plunder the egyptians
33  jehovah said further to moses go on your way from here with the people whom you led up out of the land of egypt
journey to the land about which i swore to abraham isaac and jacob saying to your offspring i will give it
2  i will send an angel ahead of you and drive out the caʹnaanites the amʹorites the hitʹtites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites
3  go up to a land flowing with milk and honey
but i will not go in the midst of you for you are an obstinate people and i might exterminate you on the way
4  when the people heard this harsh word they began to mourn and not one of them put on his ornaments
5  jehovah said to moses say to the israelites you are an obstinate people
in one moment i could go through the midst of you and exterminate you
so now keep your ornaments off while i consider what to do to you
6  so from mount hoʹreb onward the israelites refrained from wearing their ornaments
7  now moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp at some distance from the camp and he called it a tent of meeting
everyone inquiring of jehovah would go out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp
8  as soon as moses went out to the tent all the people would rise and stand at the entrance of their own tents and they would gaze after moses until he entered into the tent
9  as soon as moses would go into the tent the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance of the tent while god spoke with moses
10  when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent each of them rose and bowed down at the entrance of his own tent
11  jehovah spoke to moses facetoface just as one man would speak to another man
when he returned to the camp joshua the son of nun his minister and attendant would not depart from the tent
12  now moses said to jehovah see you are saying to me lead this people up but you have not let me know whom you will send with me
moreover you have said i know you by name and you have also found favor in my eyes
13  please if i have found favor in your eyes make me know your ways so that i may know you and continue to find favor in your eyes
consider too that this nation is your people
14  so he said i myself will go with you and i will give you rest
15  then moses said to him if you yourself are not going along do not lead us up from here
16  how will it be known that i have found favor in your eyes i and your people is it not by your going along with us so that i and your people will be distinguished from every other people on the face of the earth
17  jehovah went on to say to moses i will also do this thing that you request because you have found favor in my eyes and i know you by name
18  then he said please show me your glory
19  but he said i will make all my goodness pass before your face and i will declare before you the name of jehovah and i will favor the one whom i favor and i will show mercy to the one to whom i show mercy
20  but he added you cannot see my face for no man can see me and live
21  jehovah said further here is a place near me
station yourself on the rock
22  when my glory is passing by i will place you in a crevice of the rock and i will shield you with my hand until i have passed by
23  after that i will take my hand away and you will see my back
but my face may not be seen
12  jehovah now said to moses and aaron in the land of egypt
2  this month will be the beginning of the months for you
it will be the first of the months of the year for you
3  speak to the entire assembly of israel saying on the tenth day of this month they should each take for themselves a sheep for their fathers house a sheep to a house
4  but if the household is too small for the sheep they and their nearest neighbor should share it between themselves in their house according to the number of people
when making the calculation determine how much of the sheep each one will eat
5  your sheep should be a sound oneyearold male
you may choose from the young rams or from the goats
6  you must care for it until the 14th day of this month and the whole congregation of the assembly of israel must slaughter it at twilight
7  they must take some of the blood and splash it on the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway of the houses in which they eat it
8  they must eat the meat on this night
they should roast it over the fire and eat it along with unleavened bread and bitter greens
9  do not eat any of it raw or boiled cooked in water but roast it over the fire its head together with its shanks and its inner parts
10  you must not save any of it until morning but any of it left over until morning you should burn with fire
11  and this is how you should eat it with your belt fastened sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand and you should eat it in a hurry
it is jehovahs passover
12  for i will pass through the land of egypt on this night and strike every firstborn in the land of egypt from man to beast and i will execute judgment on all the gods of egypt
i am jehovah
13  the blood will serve as your sign on the houses where you are and i will see the blood and pass over you and the plague will not come on you to destroy you when i strike the land of egypt
14  this day will serve as a memorial for you and you must celebrate it as a festival to jehovah throughout your generations
as a lasting statute you should celebrate it
15  seven days you are to eat unleavened bread
yes on the first day you are to remove the sourdough from your houses because anyone eating what is leavened from the first day down to the seventh that person must be cut off from israel
16  on the first day you will hold a holy convention and on the seventh day another holy convention
no work is to be done on these days
only what every person needs to eat that alone may be prepared for you
17  you must keep the festival of unleavened bread for on this very day i will bring your multitudes out of the land of egypt
and you must keep this day throughout your generations as a lasting statute
18  in the first month on the 14th day of the month in the evening you are to eat unleavened bread until the 21st day of the month in the evening
19  no sourdough is to be found in your houses for seven days because if anyone eats what is leavened whether he is a foreigner or a native of the land that person must be cut off from the assembly of israel
20  you should not eat anything leavened
in all your homes you are to eat unleavened bread
21  moses promptly called all the elders of israel and said to them go and select young animals for each of your families and slaughter the passover sacrifice
22  then you must dip a bunch of hyssop into the blood that is in a basin and strike the upper part of the doorway and the two doorposts with the blood and none of you should go out of the entrance of his house until morning
23  then when jehovah passes through to plague the egyptians and sees the blood on the upper part of the doorway and on the two doorposts jehovah will certainly pass over the entrance and he will not allow the plague of death to enter into your houses
24  you must observe this event as a lasting regulation for you and your sons
25  and when you come into the land that jehovah will give you just as he has stated you must keep this observance
26  and when your sons ask you what does this observance mean to you
27  you must say it is the sacrifice of the passover to jehovah who passed over the houses of the israelites in egypt when he plagued the egyptians but he spared our houses
then the people bowed low and prostrated themselves
28  so the israelites went and did just as jehovah had commanded moses and aaron
they did just so
29  then at midnight jehovah struck down every firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharʹaoh who was sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison and every firstborn of the animals
30  pharʹaoh got up that night along with all his servants and all the other egyptians and there was a great outcry among the egyptians because there was not a house where someone was not dead
31  at once he called moses and aaron by night and said get up get out from among my people both you and the other israelites
go and serve jehovah just as you have said
32  take also your flocks and your herds and go just as you have said
but you must also bless me
33  and the egyptians began to urge the people to depart quickly out of the land because as they said we are all as good as dead
34  so the people carried their flour dough before it was leavened with their kneading troughs wrapped up in their clothing on their shoulder
35  the israelites did what moses had told them and asked the egyptians for articles of silver and of gold as well as clothing
36  jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the egyptians so that they gave them what they asked for and they plundered the egyptians
37  then the israelites departed from ramʹeses for sucʹcoth about 600000 men on foot besides children
38  and a vast mixed company also went with them as well as flocks and herds a great number of livestock
39  they began to bake the dough that they brought from egypt into round loaves of unleavened bread
it was not leavened because they had been driven out of egypt so suddenly that they had not prepared any provisions for themselves
40  the dwelling of the israelites who had dwelled in egypt was 430 years
41  at the end of the 430 years on this very day all the multitudes of jehovah went out of the land of egypt
42  it is a night on which they will celebrate jehovahs bringing them out of the land of egypt
this night is to be observed to jehovah by all the people of israel throughout their generations
43  then jehovah said to moses and aaron this is the statute of the passover no foreigner may eat of it
44  but if someone has a slave man who was purchased with money you should circumcise him
only then may he share in eating it
45  a settler and a hired worker may not eat of it
46  in one house it is to be eaten
you must not take any of the meat outside of the house and you must not break any of its bones
47  all the assembly of israel are to celebrate it
48  if a foreigner resides with you and he wants to celebrate the passover to jehovah every male of his must be circumcised
then he may come near to celebrate it and he will become like a native of the land
but no uncircumcised man may eat of it
49  one law will apply for the native and for the foreigner who is residing among you
50  so all the israelites did just as jehovah had commanded moses and aaron
they did just so
51  on this very day jehovah brought the israelites along with their multitudes out of the land of egypt
