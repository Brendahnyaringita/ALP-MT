4  hear this word you cows of baʹshanwho are on the mountain of samarʹiayou women who are defrauding the lowly and crushing the poorwho say to their husbands bring us something to drink
2  the sovereign lord jehovah has sworn by his holinesslook the days are coming upon you when he will lift you up with butcher hooksand the rest of you with fishhooks
3  you will go out through the breaches in the wall each one straight aheadand you will be cast out to harʹmon declares jehovah
4  come to bethʹel and commit transgressionto gilʹgal and transgress even more bring your sacrifices in the morningand your tithes on the third day
5  burn a thanksgiving sacrifice of leavened breadloudly proclaim your voluntary offerings for that is what you love to do o people of israel declares the sovereign lord jehovah
6  and for my part i made your teeth clean of food in all your citiesand caused a lack of bread in all your housesbut you did not come back to me declares jehovah
7  i also withheld rain from you three months before the harvesti made it rain on one city but not on another city
one plot of land would have rainbut another plot of land where there was no rain would dry up
8  people of two or three cities staggered to one city to drink waterand they would not get satisfiedbut you did not come back to me declares jehovah
9  i struck you with scorching heat and mildew
you multiplied your gardens and vineyardsbut the locust would devour your fig trees and olive treesand you still did not come back to me declares jehovah
10  i sent among you a pestilence like that of egypt
with the sword i killed your young men and captured your horses
i made the stench of your camps rise up into your nostrilsbut you did not come back to me declares jehovah
11  i caused an overthrow among youlike gods overthrow of sodʹom and gomorʹrah
and you were like a log snatched out of the firebut you did not come back to me declares jehovah
12  so that is what i will do to you o israel
because this is what i will do to youget ready to meet your god o israel
13  for look he is the one who formed the mountains and created the windhe tells man what his thoughts arehe turns the dawn into darknessand he treads on earths high placesjehovah the god of armies is his name
8  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah showed me look there was a basket of summer fruit
2  then he said what do you see aʹmos i replied a basket of summer fruit
then jehovah said to me the end has come for my people israel
i will no longer pardon them
3  the songs of the temple will turn into wailing in that day declares the sovereign lord jehovah
there will be many carcasses thrown everywherehush
4  hear this you who trample on the poorand who bring the meek of the land to an end
5  who say when will the new moon festival be over that we may sell our grainand the sabbath that we may offer grain for sale so that we may make the eʹphah measure smallerand the shekel weight greaterto falsify our scales of deception
6  so that we may buy the needy for silverand the poor for a pair of sandalsand sell the worthless part of the grain
7  jehovah has sworn by the pride of jacobnever will i forget all their deeds
8  on this account the land will trembleand every inhabitant in it will mourn
will it not all rise like the nileand surge and sink down like the nile of egypt
9  in that day declares the sovereign lord jehovahi will make the sun go down at high noonand i will darken the land on a bright day
10  i will turn your festivals into mourningand all your songs into dirges
i will put sackcloth on all hips and make every head baldi will make it like the mourning for an only sonand the end of it like a bitter day
11  look the days are coming declares the sovereign lord jehovahwhen i will send a famine into the landnot a famine for bread or a thirst for waterbut for hearing the words of jehovah
12  they will stagger from sea to seaand from the north to the east
they will rove about searching for the word of jehovah but they will not find it
13  in that day beautiful virgins will faintalso young men because of the thirst
14  those who swear by the guilt of samarʹia and who sayas surely as your god lives o dan and as surely as the way of beʹersheʹba lives they will fall and they will not rise up again
9  i saw jehovah stationed above the altar and he said strike the head of the pillar and the thresholds will shake
cut them off at the head and i will kill the last of them with the sword
no one who flees will get away and no one trying to escape will succeed
2  if they dig down into the gravefrom there my hand will take themand if they go up to the heavensfrom there i will bring them down
3  and if they hide themselves on the top of carʹmelfrom there i will search them out and take them
if they conceal themselves from my eyes on the bottom of the seathere i will command the serpent to bite them
4  if they go into captivity before their enemiesfrom there i will command the sword and it will kill themi will fix my eyes on them for bad and not for good
5  for the sovereign lord jehovah of the armies is the one who touches the landso that it melts and all its inhabitants will mournand all of it will rise like the nileand sink down like the nile of egypt
6  the one who builds his stairs in the heavensand establishes his structure over the earththe one who summons the waters of the seato pour them out on the surface of the earthjehovah is his name
7  are you not like the sons of the cushʹites to me o people of israel declares jehovah
did i not bring israel up out of the land of egyptthe philisʹtines out of crete and syria out of kir
8  look the eyes of the sovereign lord jehovah are on the sinful kingdomand he will annihilate it from the surface of the land
but i will not completely annihilate the house of jacob declares jehovah
9  for look i am giving the commandand i will shake the house of israel among all the nationsjust as one shakes a sieveand not a pebble falls to the ground
10  they will die by the sword all the sinners of my peoplethose who are saying the calamity will not come near us or reach us
11  in that day i will raise up the booth of david that is falleni will repair the breachesand i will restore its ruinsi will rebuild it as in the days of long ago
12  so that they may take possession of what is remaining of eʹdomand all the nations on whom my name has been called declares jehovah who is doing this
13  look the days are coming declares jehovahwhen the plowman will overtake the harvesterand the treader of grapes the one carrying seedand the mountains will drip with sweet wineand all the hills will flow with it
14  i will gather back the captives of my people israeland they will rebuild the desolated cities and inhabit themthey will plant vineyards and drink their wineand make gardens and eat their fruit
15  i will plant them on their landand they will never again be uprootedfrom their land that i have given them says jehovah your god
7  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah showed me look he formed a locust swarm when the late crop was beginning to come up
this was the later crop after the kings hay had been cut
2  when the swarm finished eating up the vegetation of the land i said o sovereign lord jehovah please forgive how can jacob survive for he is weak
3  so jehovah reconsidered this
it will not happen jehovah said
4  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah showed me look the sovereign lord jehovah called for a punishment by fire
it consumed the vast deep waters and it consumed a portion of the land
5  then i said o sovereign lord jehovah please hold this back
how can jacob survive for he is weak
6  so jehovah reconsidered this
that too will not happen the sovereign lord jehovah said
7  this is what he showed me look jehovah was standing on a wall made with a plumb line and there was a plumb line in his hand
8  then jehovah said to me what do you see aʹmos so i said a plumb line
jehovah then said here i am putting a plumb line among my people israel
i will no longer pardon them
9  the high places of isaac will be desolated and the sanctuaries of israel will be devastated and i will come against the house of jeroboʹam with a sword
10  amaziʹah the priest of bethʹel sent this message to king jeroboʹam of israel aʹmos is conspiring against you right in the midst of the house of israel
the land cannot put up with all his words
11  for this is what aʹmos says jeroboʹam will die by the sword and israel will surely go into exile from its land
12  amaziʹah then said to aʹmos o visionary go run away to the land of judah earn your bread there and there you may prophesy
13  but you must no longer prophesy at bethʹel for it is the sanctuary of a king and the house of a kingdom
14  then aʹmos answered amaziʹah i was not a prophet nor the son of a prophet but i was a herdsman and i took care of sycamore fig trees
15  but jehovah took me away from following the flock and jehovah said to me go prophesy to my people israel
16  so now hear the word of jehovah you are saying do not prophesy against israel and do not preach against the house of isaac
17  therefore this is what jehovah says your wife will become a prostitute in the city and your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword
your land will be apportioned out with a measuring line and you yourself will die in an unclean land and israel will surely go into exile from its land
6  woe to the selfassured ones in zionto those feeling secure in the mountain of samarʹiathe prominent men of the foremost of nationsthose to whom the house of israel comes
2  cross over to calʹneh and see
go from there to great haʹmathand go down to gath of the philisʹtines
are they better than these kingdomsor is their territory larger than yours
3  are you putting out of your mind the day of calamityand bringing in a reign of violence
4  they lie on beds of ivory and sprawl out on coucheseating the rams of the flock and the fattened calves
5  they improvise songs to the sound of the harpand like david they invent musical instruments
6  they drink wine by the bowlfuland anoint themselves with the choicest oils
but they are unconcerned about the catastrophe of joseph
7  so they will go into exile at the head of the exilesand the revelry of those sprawled out will come to an end
8  the sovereign lord jehovah has sworn by himself declares jehovah the god of armiesi detest the pride of jacobi hate his fortified towersand i will hand over the city and what fills it
9  and if ten men are left in one house they will also die
10  a relative will come to carry them out and burn them one by one
he will bring their bones out from the house then he will say to whoever is in the inner rooms of the house are there any more with you and he will say nobody then he will say keep silent for it is not the time to make any mention of the name of jehovah
11  for it is jehovah giving the commandand he will strike down the great house into rubbleand the small house into debris
12  do horses run on a cragor will one plow there with cattle for you have turned justice into a poisonous plantand the fruit of righteousness into wormwood
13  you rejoice over what is worthlessand you say have we not become powerful in our own strength
14  therefore o house of israel i will bring against you a nation declares jehovah the god of armiesand they will oppress you from leʹbohaʹmath down to the wadi of the arʹabah
5  hear this word that i am taking up against you as a dirge o house of israel
2  the virgin israel has fallenshe cannot get up again
she has been abandoned on her own groundthere is no one to raise her up
3  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says the city that marches out with a thousand will have a hundred leftand the one that goes out with a hundred will have ten left for the house of israel
4  for this is what jehovah says to the house of israel search for me and keep living
5  do not search for bethʹeldo not go to gilʹgal or pass over to beʹersheʹbafor gilʹgal will certainly go into exileand bethʹel will come to nothing
6  search for jehovah and keep livingso that he does not burst out like a fire on the house of josephconsuming bethʹel with no one to extinguish it
7  you turn justice into wormwoodand you cast righteousness to the earth
8  the one who made the kiʹmah constellation and the keʹsil constellationthe one who turns deep shadow into morningthe one who makes day as dark as nightthe one who summons the waters of the seato pour them out on the surface of the earthjehovah is his name
9  he will cause destruction to burst out against the strongbringing destruction on fortified places
10  they hate those who give reproof in the city gateand they detest those who speak truthfully
11  because you demand farm rent from the poorand you take his grain as tributeyou will not keep dwelling in the houses of hewn stone that you have builtnor drink the wine from the choice vineyards that you have planted
12  for i know how many your revolts areand how great your sins areyou harass the righteousyou take bribesand you deny the rights of the poor in the city gate
13  therefore those with insight will keep silent at that timefor it will be a time of calamity
14  search for what is good and not what is badso that you may keep living
then jehovah the god of armies may be with youjust as you say he is
15  hate what is bad and love what is goodlet justice prevail in the city gate
it may be that jehovah the god of armieswill show favor to the remaining ones of joseph
16  therefore this is what jehovah the god of armies jehovah says in all the public squares there will be wailingand in all the streets they will say alas alas they will call on the farmers to mournand the professional mourners to wail
17  in every vineyard there will be wailingfor i will pass through your midst says jehovah
18  woe to those who yearn for the day of jehovah what then will the day of jehovah mean for you it will be darkness and not light
19  it will be like a man who flees from a lion and is confronted by a bearand when he enters his house and leans his hand against the wall a snake bites him
20  will not the day of jehovah be darkness and not lightwill it not have gloom and not brightness
21  i hate i despise your festivalsand i take no pleasure in the aroma of your solemn assemblies
22  even if you offer me whole burnt offerings and gift offeringsi will find no pleasure in themand i will not look with favor on your communion sacrifices of fattened animals
23  spare me the din of your songsand let me not hear the melodies of your stringed instruments
24  let justice flow down like watersand righteousness like an everflowing stream
25  did you bring me sacrifices and gift offeringsfor those 40 years in the wilderness o house of israel
26  now you will have to carry away sakʹkuth your king and kaiʹwanyour images the star of your god whom you made for yourselves
27  and i will send you into exile beyond damascus says he whose name is jehovah the god of armies
1  the words of aʹmos who was among the sheep raisers from tekoʹa which he received in vision concerning israel in the days of king uzziʹah of judah and in the days of jeroboʹam son of joʹash the king of israel two years before the earthquake
2  he said jehovah will roar out of zionand he will raise his voice out of jerusalem
the pastures of the shepherds will mournand the summit of carʹmel will dry up
3  this is what jehovah saysfor three revolts of damascus and for four i will not reverse itbecause they threshed gilʹead with iron threshing sledges
4  so i will send a fire upon the house of hazʹaeland it will consume the fortified towers of benhaʹdad
5  i will break the bars of damascusi will destroy the inhabitants from bikʹathaʹvenand the one ruling from betheʹdenand the people of syria will go as exiles to kir says jehovah
6  this is what jehovah saysfor three revolts of gazʹa and for four i will not reverse itbecause they took a whole group of exiles to hand them over to eʹdom
7  so i will send a fire onto the wall of gazʹaand it will consume her fortified towers
8  i will destroy the inhabitants from ashʹdodand the one ruling from ashʹkeloni will turn my hand against ekʹronand the remaining philisʹtines will perish says the sovereign lord jehovah
9  this is what jehovah saysfor three revolts of tyre and for four i will not reverse itbecause they handed over a whole group of exiles to eʹdomand because they did not remember the covenant of brothers
10  so i will send a fire onto the wall of tyreand it will consume her fortified towers
11  this is what jehovah saysfor three revolts of eʹdom and for four i will not reverse itbecause he pursued his own brother with the swordand because he refused to show mercyin his anger he keeps tearing them apart relentlesslyand he remains furious with them continually
12  so i will send a fire into teʹmanand it will consume the fortified towers of bozʹrah
13  this is what jehovah saysfor three revolts of the amʹmonites and for four i will not reverse itbecause they ripped open the pregnant women of gilʹead to widen out their own territory
14  so i will set fire to the wall of rabʹbahand it will consume her fortified towerswith a war cry in the day of battlewith a tempest in the day of storm wind
15  and their king will go into exile together with his princes says jehovah
2  this is what jehovah saysfor three revolts of moʹab and for four i will not reverse itbecause he burned the bones of the king of eʹdom for lime
2  so i will send a fire into moʹaband it will consume the fortified towers of keʹriothmoʹab will die amid an uproarwith a war cry with the sound of a horn
3  i will remove the ruler from her midstand kill all her princes along with him says jehovah
4  this is what jehovah saysfor three revolts of judah and for four i will not reverse itbecause they rejected the law of jehovahand because they did not keep his regulationsbut the same lies their forefathers followed have led them astray
5  so i will send a fire into judahand it will consume the fortified towers of jerusalem
6  this is what jehovah saysfor three revolts of israel and for four i will not reverse itbecause they sell the righteous for silverand the poor for a pair of sandals
7  they trample the heads of the lowly into the dust of the earthand they block the path of the meek
a man and his father have relations with the same girlprofaning my holy name
8  they stretch out next to every altar on garments they seized as security for a loanand the wine they drink at the house of their gods was obtained from those they fined
9  but it was i who annihilated the amʹorite before themwho was as tall as the cedars and as strong as the oaksi destroyed his fruit above and his roots below
10  i brought you up out of the land of egyptand i made you walk through the wilderness 40 yearsto take possession of the land of the amʹorite
11  i raised up some of your sons as prophetsand some of your young men as nazʹirites
is this not so o people of israel declares jehovah
12  but you kept giving the nazʹirites wine to drinkand you commanded the prophets you must not prophesy
13  so i will crush you in your placejust as a wagon loaded with cut grain crushes what is under it
14  the swift one will have no place to fleethe strong one will not retain his powerand no warrior will escape with his life
15  the bowman will not stand his groundthe swift of foot will not escapeand the horseman will not escape with his life
16  even the most courageous among the warriorswill flee naked in that day declares jehovah
3  hear this word that jehovah has spoken concerning you o people of israel concerning the whole family that i brought up out of the land of egypt
2  you alone i have known out of all the families of the earth
that is why i will call you to account for all your errors
3  will two walk together unless they have agreed to meet
4  will a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey will a young lion growl from its lair when it has caught nothing
5  will a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no snare for it does a trap spring up from the ground when it has caught nothing
6  if a horn is blown in a city do the people not tremble if a calamity occurs in the city is it not jehovah who has acted
7  for the sovereign lord jehovah will not do a thingunless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets
8  the lion has roared who will not be afraid the sovereign lord jehovah has spoken who will not prophesy
9  proclaim it on the fortified towers of ashʹdodand on the fortified towers in the land of egypt
say gather together against the mountains of samarʹiasee the turmoil in her midstand the defrauding within her
10  for they do not know how to do what is right declares jehovahthose who are storing up violence and destruction in their fortified towers
11  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah saysan adversary will surround the landhe will strip you of your strengthand your fortified towers will be plundered
12  this is what jehovah saysjust as the shepherd snatches away two legs or a piece of an ear from the mouth of the lionthat is how the people of israel will be snatched awaythose now sitting in samarʹia on splendid beds and on fine couches
13  hear and warn the house of jacob declares the sovereign lord jehovah the god of armies
14  for in the day i call israel to account for all his revoltsi will also call for an accounting against the altars of bethʹelthe horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the earth
15  i will strike down the winter house along with the summer house
the houses of ivory will perishand the great houses will come to their end declares jehovah
