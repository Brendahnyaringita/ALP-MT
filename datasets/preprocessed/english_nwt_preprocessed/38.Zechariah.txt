10  ask jehovah for rain in the time of the spring rain
it is jehovah who makes the storm cloudswho pours rain for themand gives vegetation in the field to everyone
2  for the teraphim statues have spoken deceptionand the diviners have visioned a lie
they speak about worthless dreamsand in vain they try to comfort
that is why they will wander like sheep
they will suffer for there is no shepherd
3  against the shepherds my anger burnsand against the oppressive leaders i will hold an accountingfor jehovah of armies has turned his attention to his flock to the house of judahand he has made them like his majestic horse in the battle
4  from him comes the keymanfrom him comes the supporting rulerfrom him comes the battle bowfrom him goes forth every overseer all of them together
5  and they will become like warriorstrampling down the mud of the streets in the battle
they will wage war for jehovah is with themand the riders of horses will be put to shame
6  i will make the house of judah superiorand the house of joseph i will save
i will restore themfor i will show them mercyand they will be as though i had never cast them offfor i am jehovah their god and i will answer them
7  those of eʹphraim must become like a mighty warriorand their heart will rejoice as though from wine
their sons will see this and rejoicetheir heart will be joyful in jehovah
8  i will whistle for them and gather them togetherfor i will redeem them and they will become manyand continue to be many
9  though i scatter them like seed among the peoplesthey will remember me in the distant placeswith their sons they will revive and return
10  i will bring them back from the land of egyptand gather them from assyrʹiai will bring them to the land of gilʹead and lebʹanonand there will be no more room for them
11  he must pass through the sea with distressand in the sea he will strike down the wavesall the depths of the nile will dry up
the pride of assyrʹia will be brought downand the scepter of egypt will depart
12  i will make them superior in jehovahand they will walk about in his name declares jehovah
4  the angel who had been speaking with me came back and woke me up as when waking someone from sleep
2  then he said to me what do you see so i said i see and look a lampstand entirely of gold with a bowl on top of it
there are seven lamps on it yes seven and the lamps which are at the top of it have seven pipes
3  and next to it are two olive trees one on the right of the bowl and one on the left
4  then i asked the angel who was speaking with me what do these things mean my lord
5  so the angel who was speaking with me asked do you not know what these things mean i replied no my lord
6  he then said to me this is the word of jehovah to zerubʹbabel not by a military force nor by power but by my spirit says jehovah of armies
7  who are you o great mountain before zerubʹbabel you will become a level land
and he will bring out the top stone amid shouts of how wonderful how wonderful
8  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
9  the hands of zerubʹbabel have laid the foundation of this house and his own hands will finish it
and you will have to know that jehovah of armies has sent me to you
10  for who has despised the day of small beginnings for they will rejoice and see the plumb line in the hand of zerubʹbabel
these seven are the eyes of jehovah which are roving about in all the earth
11  then i asked him what is the meaning of these two olive trees on the right and on the left of the lampstand
12  i asked him a second time what is the meaning of the two bunches of twigs of the olive trees that are pouring out the golden liquid through the two golden tubes
13  so he asked me do you not know what these things mean i replied no my lord
14  he said these are the two anointed ones who are standing alongside the lord of the whole earth
11  open your doors o lebʹanonso that a fire may consume your cedars
2  wail you juniper for the cedar has fallenthe majestic trees have been destroyed wail you oaks of baʹshanfor the dense forest has come down
3  listen the wailing of shepherdsfor their majesty has been devastated
listen the roaring of young lionsfor the dense thickets along the jordan have been destroyed
4  this is what jehovah my god says shepherd the flock meant for the slaughter
5  whose buyers slaughtered them and are not held guilty
and those who sell them say may jehovah be praised for i will become rich
and their shepherds have no compassion for them
6  for i will no longer show compassion on the inhabitants of the land declares jehovah
so i will cause each man to fall into the hand of his neighbor and his king and they will crush the land and i will not rescue them out of their hand
7  and i began to shepherd the flock meant for slaughter in your behalf o afflicted ones of the flock
so i took two staffs and i called one pleasantness and the other union and i began to shepherd the flock
8  and i dismissed three shepherds in one month for i became impatient with them and they detested me as well
9  and i said i will not keep shepherding you
let the one who is dying die and let the one perishing perish
as for those who are left let them devour one anothers flesh
10  so i took my staff pleasantness and cut it up breaking my covenant that i had made with all the peoples
11  so it was broken in that day and the afflicted ones of the flock who were watching me knew that it was the word of jehovah
12  then i said to them if it seems good to you give me my wages but if not withhold them
and they paid my wages 30 pieces of silver
13  then jehovah said to me throw it into the treasurythe magnificent value with which they valued me
so i took the 30 pieces of silver and threw it into the treasury at the house of jehovah
14  then i cut up my second staff the union breaking the brotherhood between judah and israel
15  and jehovah said to me now take the equipment of a useless shepherd
16  for i am letting a shepherd rise up in the land
he will not take care of the sheep that are perishing he will not seek out the young or heal the injured or feed those able to stand
instead he devours the flesh of the fat one and tears off the hooves of the sheep
17  woe to my worthless shepherd who is abandoning the flock a sword will strike his arm and his right eye
his arm will wither completelyand his right eye will go completely blind
8  the word of jehovah of armies again came saying
2  this is what jehovah of armies says i will be zealous for zion with a great zeal and with great wrath i will be zealous for her
3  this is what jehovah says i will return to zion and reside in jerusalem and jerusalem will be called the city of truth and the mountain of jehovah of armies the holy mountain
4  this is what jehovah of armies says old men and women will again sit in the public squares of jerusalem each with his staff in his hand because of his great age
5  and the public squares of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing there
6  this is what jehovah of armies says although it may seem too difficult to the remaining ones of this people in those days should it seem too difficult also to me declares jehovah of armies
7  this is what jehovah of armies says here i am saving my people from the lands of the east and the west
8  and i will bring them in and they will reside in jerusalem and they will become my people and i will become their god in truth and in righteousness
9  this is what jehovah of armies says let your hands be strong you who now hear these words from the mouth of the prophets the same words that were spoken on the day the foundation of the house of jehovah of armies was laid for the temple to be built
10  for before that time there were no wages being paid either for man or for beast and it was not safe to come and go because of the adversary for i turned all men one against another
11  but now i will not deal with the remaining ones of this people as in the former days declares jehovah of armies
12  for the seed of peace will be sown the vine will produce its fruit and the earth its yield and the heavens will give their dew and i will cause the remaining ones of this people to inherit all these things
13  and just as you became an object of cursing among the nations o house of judah and house of israel so i will save you and you will become a blessing
do not be afraid let your hands be strong
14  for this is what jehovah of armies says just as i had determined to bring calamity on you because your forefathers made me indignant says jehovah of armies and i felt no regret
15  so at this time i have determined to do good to jerusalem and to the house of judah
do not be afraid
16  these are the things you should do speak the truth with one another and the judgments in your gates must promote truth and peace
17  do not scheme calamity against one another in your hearts and do not love any false oath for these are all things that i hate declares jehovah
18  the word of jehovah of armies again came to me saying
19  this is what jehovah of armies says the fast of the fourth month the fast of the fifth month the fast of the seventh month and the fast of the tenth month will be occasions for exultation and joy for the house of judahfestivals of rejoicing
so love truth and peace
20  this is what jehovah of armies says it will yet come to pass that peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will come
21  and the inhabitants of one city will go to those of another and say let us earnestly go to beg for the favor of jehovah and to seek jehovah of armies
i am also going
22  and many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek jehovah of armies in jerusalem and to beg for the favor of jehovah
23  this is what jehovah of armies says in those days ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold yes they will take firm hold of the robe of a jew saying we want to go with you for we have heard that god is with you people
9  a pronouncement the word of jehovah is against the land of haʹdrachand damascus is its targetfor jehovahs eye is on mankindand on all the tribes of israel
2  and against haʹmath which borders on herand against tyre and siʹdon for they are so wise
3  tyre built herself a rampart
she piled up silver like dustand gold like the dirt of the streets
4  look jehovah will take away her possessionsand he will strike down her army into the seaand she will be consumed in the fire
5  ashʹkelon will see it and be afraidgazʹa will feel great anguishalso ekʹron because her hope is put to shame
a king will perish from gazʹaand ashʹkelon will not be inhabited
6  an illegitimate son will settle in ashʹdodand i will do away with the pride of the philisʹtine
7  i will remove the bloodstained things from his mouthand the disgusting things from between his teethand he will be left remaining for our godand he will become like a sheikh in judahand ekʹron like the jebʹusite
8  i will encamp as a guard for my houseso that there will be no one passing through and no one returningand no taskmaster will pass through againfor now i have seen it with my eyes
9  rejoice greatly o daughter of zion
shout in triumph o daughter of jerusalem
look your king is coming to you
he is righteous bringing salvationhumble and riding on a donkeyon a colt the foal of a female donkey
10  i will take away the war chariot from eʹphraimand the horse from jerusalem
the battle bow will be taken away
and he will proclaim peace to the nationshis rulership will be from sea to seaand from the river to the ends of the earth
11  as for you o woman by the blood of your covenanti will send your prisoners out of the waterless pit
12  return to the stronghold you prisoners with hope
today i am telling youi will repay to you o woman a double portion
13  for i will bend judah as my bow
the bow i will fill with eʹphraimand i will awaken your sons o zionagainst your sons o greeceand i will make you like a warriors sword
14  jehovah will be seen over themand his arrow will go out like lightning
the sovereign lord jehovah will sound the hornand he will advance with the windstorms of the south
15  jehovah of armies will defend themand they will devour and subdue the slingstones
they will drink and be boisterous as if with wineand they will be filled like the bowllike the corners of the altar
16  jehovah their god will save them in that dayas the flock of his peoplefor they will be like the gemstones of a crown glittering over his soil
17  for how great his goodness isand how great his handsomeness is grain will make the young men thriveand new wine the virgins
7  and in the fourth year of king dariʹus the word of jehovah came to zechariʹah on the fourth day of the ninth month that is the month of chisʹlev
2  the people of bethʹel sent shareʹzer and reʹgemmelʹech and his men to beg for the favor of jehovah
3  saying to the priests of the house of jehovah of armies and to the prophets should i weep in the fifth month and abstain from food as i have done for so many years
4  the word of jehovah of armies again came to me saying
5  say to all the people of the land and to the priests when you fasted and wailed in the fifth month and in the seventh month for 70 years did you really fast for me
6  and when you would eat and drink were you not eating for yourselves and drinking for yourselves
7  should you not obey the words that jehovah proclaimed through the former prophets while jerusalem and her surrounding cities were inhabited and at peace and while the negʹeb and the shepheʹlah were inhabited
8  the word of jehovah again came to zechariʹah saying
9  this is what jehovah of armies says judge with true justice and deal with one another in loyal love and mercy
10  do not defraud the widow or the fatherless child the foreigner or the poor and do not scheme evil against one another in your hearts
11  but they kept refusing to pay attention and they stubbornly turned their backs and they stopped up their ears so as not to hear
12  they made their heart like a diamond and would not obey the law and the words that jehovah of armies sent by his spirit through the former prophets
so there came great indignation from jehovah of armies
13  just as they did not listen when i called so i would not listen when they called says jehovah of armies
14  and i scattered them with a storm wind throughout all the nations that they had not known and the land was left desolate behind them with no one passing through or returning for they turned the desirable land into an object of horror
6  then i looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two mountains and the mountains were of copper
2  the first chariot had red horses and the second chariot black horses
3  the third chariot had white horses and the fourth chariot speckled and dappled horses
4  i asked the angel who was speaking with me what are these my lord
5  the angel answered me these are the four spirits of the heavens that are going out after having taken their station before the lord of the whole earth
6  the one with the black horses is going out to the land of the north the white ones are going out beyond the sea and the speckled ones are going out to the land of the south
7  and the dappled ones were eager to go out to walk about through the earth
then he said go walk about through the earth
and they began walking about through the earth
8  he then called out to me and said see those going out to the land of the north have caused the spirit of jehovah to rest in the land of the north
9  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
10  take from helʹdai tobiʹjah and jedaʹiah what they brought from the people in exile and on that day you must go to the house of josiʹah the son of zephaniʹah along with these who have come from babylon
11  you should take silver and gold and make a crown and put it on the head of joshua son of jehozʹadak the high priest
12  and say to himthis is what jehovah of armies says here is the man whose name is sprout
he will sprout from his own place and he will build the temple of jehovah
13  he is the one who will build the temple of jehovah and he is the one who will assume the majesty
he will sit down on his throne and rule and he will also be a priest on his throne and there will be a peaceable agreement between the two
14  and the crown will serve as a memorial for heʹlem tobiʹjah jedaʹiah and hen the son of zephaniʹah in the temple of jehovah
15  and those who are far away will come and take part in building the temple of jehovah
and you will have to know that jehovah of armies has sent me to you
and it will occurif you do not fail to listen to the voice of jehovah your god
13  in that day a well will be opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for cleansing sin and impurity
2  in that day declares jehovah of armies i will erase the names of the idols from the land and they will no longer be remembered and i will rid the land of the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness
3  and if a man should prophesy again his father and his mother who caused his birth will say to him you will not live because you have spoken lies in the name of jehovah
and his father and his mother who caused his birth will pierce him through because of his prophesying
4  in that day each of the prophets will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies and they will not wear an official garment of hair in order to deceive
5  and he will say i am no prophet
i am a man cultivating the soil because a man bought me when i was young
6  and if someone asks him what are these wounds between your shoulders he will answer wounds i received in the house of my friends
7  o sword awake against my shepherdagainst the man who is my companion declares jehovah of armies
strike the shepherd and let the flock be scatteredand i will turn my hand against those who are insignificant
8  and in all the land declares jehovahtwo parts in it will be cut off and perishand the third part will be left remaining in it
9  and i will bring the third part through the fireand i will refine them as silver is refinedand test them as gold is tested
they will call on my nameand i will answer them
i will say they are my people and they will say jehovah is our god
14  look the day is coming a day belonging to jehovah when the spoil from you will be divided in your midst
2  i will gather all the nations against jerusalem for the war and the city will be captured and the houses plundered and the women raped
and half of the city will go into exile but the remaining ones of the people will not be cut off from the city
3  jehovah will go out and war against those nations as when he fights in the day of a battle
4  in that day his feet will stand on the mount of olives which faces jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives will be split in half from east to west forming a very great valley and half of the mountain will move to the north and half of it to the south
5  you will flee to the valley of my mountains for the valley of the mountains will extend all the way to aʹzel
you will have to flee just as you fled because of the earthquake in the days of king uzziʹah of judah
and jehovah my god will come and all the holy ones will be with him
6  in that day there will be no precious lightthings will be congealed
7  and it will become one day that is known as belonging to jehovah
it will not be day nor will it be night and at evening time there will be light
8  in that day living waters will flow out from jerusalem half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea
it will happen in summer and in winter
9  and jehovah will be king over all the earth
in that day jehovah will be one and his name one
10  the whole land will become like the arʹabah from geʹba to rimʹmon south of jerusalem and she will rise and be inhabited in her place from the gate of benjamin all the way to the site of the first gate all the way to the corner gate and from the tower of hananʹel all the way to the winepresses of the king
11  and people will inhabit her and there will never again be a curse of destruction and jerusalem will be inhabited in security
12  and this is the scourge with which jehovah will scourge all the peoples who wage war against jerusalem their flesh will rot away while they stand on their feet their eyes will rot away in their sockets and their tongues will rot away in their mouths
13  in that day confusion from jehovah will be widespread among them and each one will grab hold of the hand of his companion and his hand will come against the hand of his companion
14  judah will also be involved in the war at jerusalem and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered gold and silver and garments in vast quantity
15  and a scourge like that scourge will also come against the horses the mules the camels the donkeys and all the livestock that are in those camps
16  everyone who is left remaining out of all the nations that come against jerusalem will go up from year to year to bow down to the king jehovah of armies and to celebrate the festival of booths
17  but if anyone among the families of the earth does not go up to jerusalem to bow down to the king jehovah of armies no rain will fall on them
18  and if the family of egypt does not come up and does not come in they will have no rain
instead they will have the scourge with which jehovah scourges the nations that do not come up to celebrate the festival of booths
19  this will be the punishment for the sin of egypt and the sin of all the nations that do not come up to celebrate the festival of booths
20  in that day the words holiness belongs to jehovah will be written on the bells of the horses
and the cooking pots in the house of jehovah will be like the bowls before the altar
21  and every cooking pot in jerusalem and in judah will be holy and will belong to jehovah of armies and all those who are sacrificing will come in and use some of them for boiling
in that day there will no longer be a caʹnaanite in the house of jehovah of armies
5  again i looked up and i saw a flying scroll
2  he asked me what do you see i replied i see a flying scroll which is 20 cubits long and 10 cubits wide
3  then he said to me this is the curse that is going out over the face of all the earth because everyone who steals as written on its one side has gone unpunished and everyone who makes a sworn oath as written on its other side has gone unpunished
4  i have sent it out declares jehovah of armies and it will enter into the house of the thief and into the house of the one who makes a false oath in my name and it will remain inside that house and consume it and its timbers and its stones
5  then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and said to me look up please and see what is going out
6  so i asked what is it he replied this is the eʹphah container that is going out
he continued this is their appearance in all the earth
7  and i saw that the round lid of lead was lifted up and there was a woman sitting inside the container
8  so he said this is wickedness
then he threw her back into the eʹphah container after which he thrust the lead weight over its mouth
9  then i looked up and saw two women coming forward and they were soaring in the wind
they had wings like the wings of a stork
and they lifted up the container between the earth and heaven
10  so i asked the angel who was speaking with me where are they taking the eʹphah container
11  he replied to the land of shiʹnar to build her a house and when it is prepared she will be deposited there in her proper place
1  in the eighth month in the second year of dariʹus the word of jehovah came to the prophet zechariʹah son of berechiʹah son of idʹdo saying
2  jehovah grew greatly indignant at your fathers
3  say to them this is what jehovah of armies says return to me declares jehovah of armies and i will return to you says jehovah of armies
4  do not become like your fathers to whom the former prophets proclaimed this is what jehovah of armies says turn away please from your evil ways and your evil deeds
but they did not listen and they paid no attention to me declares jehovah
5  where are your fathers now and did the prophets live forever
6  however my words and my decrees that i commanded my servants the prophets caught up with your fathers did they not so they returned to me and said jehovah of armies has dealt with us according to our ways and our deeds just as he had determined to do
7  on the 24th day of the 11th month that is the month of sheʹbat in the second year of dariʹus the word of jehovah came to the prophet zechariʹah son of berechiʹah son of idʹdo saying
8  i saw a vision in the night
there was a man riding on a red horse and he stood still among the myrtle trees in the ravine and behind him there were red reddishbrown and white horses
9  so i said who are these my lord the angel who was speaking with me replied i will show you who these are
10  then the man who was standing still among the myrtle trees said these are the ones whom jehovah has sent out to walk about in the earth
11  and they said to the angel of jehovah who was standing among the myrtle trees we have walked about in the earth and look the whole earth is quiet and undisturbed
12  so the angel of jehovah said o jehovah of armies how long will you withhold your mercy from jerusalem and the cities of judah with whom you have been indignant these 70 years
13  jehovah answered the angel who was speaking with me with kind and comforting words
14  then the angel who was speaking with me told me call out this is what jehovah of armies says i am zealous for jerusalem and for zion with a great zeal
15  with great indignation i am indignant with the nations that are at ease because i felt indignant to a small extent but they added to the calamity
16  therefore this is what jehovah says i will return to jerusalem with mercy and my own house will be built in her declares jehovah of armies and a measuring line will be stretched out over jerusalem
17  call out once more and say this is what jehovah of armies says my cities will again overflow with goodness and jehovah will again comfort zion and again choose jerusalem
18  then i looked up and saw four horns
19  so i asked the angel who was speaking with me what are these he replied these are the horns that dispersed judah israel and jerusalem
20  jehovah then showed me four craftsmen
21  i asked what are these coming to do he said these are the horns that dispersed judah to such an extent that no one was able to raise his head
these others will come to terrify them to cast down the horns of the nations that lifted up their horns against the land of judah in order to disperse her
2  and i looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand
2  so i asked where are you going he replied to measure jerusalem to see what is her width and what is her length
3  and look the angel who was speaking with me went out and another angel came to meet him
4  then he said to him run over there and tell that young man jerusalem will be inhabited as open rural country because of all the men and livestock within her
5  and i will become to her declares jehovah a wall of fire all around and i will become the glory in her midst
6  come come flee from the land of the north declares jehovah
for i have scattered you to the four winds of the heavens declares jehovah
7  come zion make your escape you who are dwelling with the daughter of babylon
8  for this is what jehovah of armies says who after being glorified has sent me to the nations that were plundering you whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye
9  for now i will wave my hand against them and they will become plunder for their own slaves
and you will certainly know that jehovah of armies has sent me
10  shout for joy o daughter of zion for i am coming and i will reside in your midst declares jehovah
11  many nations will join themselves to jehovah in that day and they will become my people and i will reside in your midst
and you will have to know that jehovah of armies has sent me to you
12  jehovah will take possession of judah as his portion on the holy ground and he will again choose jerusalem
13  be silent all flesh before jehovah for he is taking action from his holy dwelling
3  and he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of jehovah and satan was standing at his right hand to resist him
2  then the angel of jehovah said to satan may jehovah rebuke you o satan yes may jehovah who has chosen jerusalem rebuke you is not this one a burning log snatched out of the fire
3  now joshua was clothed in filthy garments and standing before the angel
4  the angel said to those standing before him remove his filthy garments
then he said to him see i have caused your error to pass away from you and you will be clothed with fine garments
5  so i said let a clean turban be put on his head
and they put the clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of jehovah was standing nearby
6  the angel of jehovah then declared to joshua
7  this is what jehovah of armies says if you will walk in my ways and carry out your responsibilities before me then you will serve as a judge in my house and take care of my courtyards and i will give you free access among these who are standing here
8  hear please o high priest joshua you and your companions who sit before you for these men serve as a sign look i am bringing in my servant sprout
9  see the stone that i have set before joshua on the one stone are seven eyes and i am engraving an inscription on it declares jehovah of armies and i will take away the guilt of that land in one day
10  in that day declares jehovah of armies each of you will invite your neighbor to come under your vine and under your fig tree
12  a pronouncement the word of jehovah concerning israel declares jehovahthe one who stretched out the heavenswho laid the foundation of the earthand who formed the spirit of man within him
2  here i am making jerusalem a cup that causes all the surrounding peoples to stagger and there will be a siege against judah as well as against jerusalem
3  in that day i will make jerusalem a heavy stone to all the peoples
all those who lift it are sure to be severely injured and all the nations of the earth will be gathered against her
4  in that day declares jehovah i will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness
i will keep my eyes on the house of judah but i will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness
5  and the sheikhs of judah will say in their heart the inhabitants of jerusalem are a strength to me by means of jehovah of armies their god
6  in that day i will make the sheikhs of judah like a fiery pot among wood and like a fiery torch in a row of cut grain and they will consume all the surrounding peoples on the right and on the left and jerusalem will again be inhabited in her place in jerusalem
7  and jehovah will save the tents of judah first so that the beauty of the house of david and the beauty of the inhabitants of jerusalem may not be too great over judah
8  in that day jehovah will be a defense around the inhabitants of jerusalem in that day the one who stumbles among them will be like david and the house of david like god like jehovahs angel who goes before them
9  and in that day i will be certain to annihilate all the nations that come against jerusalem
10  i will pour out on the house of david and on the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of favor and supplication and they will look to the one whom they pierced and they will wail over him as they would wail over an only son and they will grieve bitterly over him as they would grieve over a firstborn son
11  in that day the wailing in jerusalem will be great like the wailing at hadadrimʹmon in the plain of megidʹdo
12  and the land will wail each family by itself the family of davids house by itself and their women by themselves the family of nathans house by itself and their women by themselves
13  the family of leʹvis house by itself and their women by themselves the family of the shimʹeites by itself and their women by themselves
14  and all the families that are left remaining each family by itself and their women by themselves
