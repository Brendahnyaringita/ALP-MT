10  after these things the lord designated 70 others and sent them out by twos ahead of him into every city and place where he himself was to go
2  then he said to them yes the harvest is great but the workers are few
therefore beg the master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest
3  go look i am sending you out as lambs in among wolves
4  do not carry a money bag or a food pouch or sandals and do not greet anyone along the road
5  wherever you enter into a house say first may this house have peace
6  and if a friend of peace is there your peace will rest upon him
but if there is not it will return to you
7  so stay in that house eating and drinking the things they provide for the worker is worthy of his wages
do not keep transferring from house to house
8  also wherever you enter into a city and they receive you eat what is set before you
9  and cure the sick ones in it and tell them the kingdom of god has come near to you
10  but wherever you enter into a city and they do not receive you go out into its main streets and say
11  we wipe off against you even the dust that sticks to our feet from your city
nevertheless know this that the kingdom of god has come near
12  i tell you that it will be more endurable for sodʹom in that day than for that city
13  woe to you choraʹzin woe to you bethsaʹida because if the powerful works that have taken place in you had taken place in tyre and siʹdon they would long ago have repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes
14  consequently it will be more endurable for tyre and siʹdon in the judgment than for you
15  and you caperʹnaum will you perhaps be exalted to heaven down to the grave you will come
16  whoever listens to you listens to me
and whoever disregards you disregards me also
moreover whoever disregards me disregards also him who sent me
17  then the 70 returned with joy saying lord even the demons are made subject to us by the use of your name
18  at that he said to them i see satan already fallen like lightning from heaven
19  look i have given you the authority to trample underfoot serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing at all will harm you
20  nevertheless do not rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you but rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens
21  in that very hour he became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said i publicly praise you father lord of heaven and earth because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children
yes o father because this is the way you approved
22  all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows who the son is except the father and no one knows who the father is except the son and anyone to whom the son is willing to reveal him
23  with that he turned to the disciples and told them privately happy are the eyes that see the things you are seeing
24  for i say to you many prophets and kings desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them
25  now look a man versed in the law stood up to test him and said teacher what do i need to do to inherit everlasting life
26  he said to him what is written in the law how do you read
27  in answer he said you must love jehovah your god with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind and your neighbor as yourself
28  he said to him you answered correctly keep doing this and you will get life
29  but wanting to prove himself righteous the man said to jesus who really is my neighbor
30  in reply jesus said a man was going down from jerusalem to jerʹicho and fell victim to robbers who stripped him beat him and went off leaving him halfdead
31  now by coincidence a priest was going down on that road but when he saw him he passed by on the opposite side
32  likewise a levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the opposite side
33  but a certain samarʹitan traveling the road came upon him and at seeing him he was moved with pity
34  so he approached him and bandaged his wounds pouring oil and wine on them
then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him
35  the next day he took out two denarʹii gave them to the innkeeper and said take care of him and whatever you spend besides this i will repay you when i return
36  who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man who fell victim to the robbers
37  he said the one who acted mercifully toward him
jesus then said to him go and do the same yourself
38  now as they went on their way he entered into a certain village
here a woman named martha received him as a guest in her house
39  she also had a sister called mary who sat down at the feet of the lord and kept listening to what he was saying
40  martha on the other hand was distracted with attending to many duties
so she came to him and said lord does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things tell her to come and help me
41  in answer the lord said to her martha martha you are anxious and disturbed about many things
42  a few things though are needed or just one
for her part mary chose the good portion and it will not be taken away from her
4  then jesus full of holy spirit turned away from the jordan and he was led about by the spirit in the wilderness
2  for 40 days being tempted by the devil
and he ate nothing in those days so when they had ended he felt hungry
3  at this the devil said to him if you are a son of god tell this stone to become a loaf of bread
4  but jesus answered him it is written man must not live on bread alone
5  so he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time
6  then the devil said to him i will give you all this authority and their glory because it has been handed over to me and i give it to whomever i wish
7  if you therefore do an act of worship before me it will all be yours
8  in reply jesus said to him it is written it is jehovah your god you must worship and it is to him alone you must render sacred service
9  he then led him into jerusalem and stationed him on the battlement of the temple and said to him if you are a son of god throw yourself down from here
10  for it is written he will give his angels a command concerning you to preserve you
11  and they will carry you on their hands so that you may not strike your foot against a stone
12  in answer jesus said to him it is said you must not put jehovah your god to the test
13  so the devil having finished all the temptation departed from him until another convenient time
14  now jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galʹilee
and good reports about him spread throughout all the surrounding country
15  also he began to teach in their synagogues and he was held in honor by all
16  he then went to nazʹareth where he had been brought up and according to his custom on the sabbath day he entered the synagogue and stood up to read
17  so the scroll of the prophet isaiah was handed to him and he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written
18  jehovahs spirit is upon me because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor
he sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind to send the crushed ones away free
19  to preach jehovahs acceptable year
20  with that he rolled up the scroll handed it back to the attendant and sat down and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed on him
21  then he began to say to them today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled
22  and they all began to give favorable witness about him and to be amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth and they were saying this is a son of joseph is it not
23  at this he said to them no doubt you will apply this saying to me physician cure yourself
do also here in your home territory the things we have heard were done in caperʹnaum
24  so he said truly i tell you that no prophet is accepted in his home territory
25  for instance i tell you in truth there were many widows in israel in the days of eliʹjah when heaven was shut up for three years and six months and a great famine came on all the land
26  yet eliʹjah was sent to none of those women but only to a widow in zarʹephath in the land of siʹdon
27  also there were many lepers in israel in the time of eliʹsha the prophet yet not one of them was cleansed only naʹaman the syrian
28  now all those hearing these things in the synagogue became filled with anger
29  and they rose up and rushed him outside the city and they led him to the brow of the mountain on which their city had been built in order to throw him down headlong
30  but he went right through their midst and continued on his way
31  he then went down to caperʹnaum a city of galʹilee
and he was teaching them on the sabbath
32  and they were astounded at his way of teaching because he spoke with authority
33  now in the synagogue there was a man with a spirit an unclean demon and he shouted with a loud voice
34  ah what have we to do with you jesus the nazareneʹ did you come to destroy us i know exactly who you are the holy one of god
35  but jesus rebuked it saying be silent and come out of him
so after throwing the man down in their midst the demon came out of him without hurting him
36  at this they were all astonished and began to say to one another what kind of speech is this for with authority and power he orders the unclean spirits and out they come
37  so the news about him kept spreading into every corner of the surrounding country
38  after leaving the synagogue he entered into simons home
now simons motherinlaw was suffering with a high fever and they asked him to help her
39  so he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her
instantly she got up and began ministering to them
40  but when the sun was setting all those who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him
by laying his hands on each one of them he cured them
41  demons also came out of many crying out and saying you are the son of god
but rebuking them he would not permit them to speak for they knew him to be the christ
42  however at daybreak he departed and went to an isolated place
but the crowds began searching for him and came to where he was and they tried to keep him from going away from them
43  but he said to them i must also declare the good news of the kingdom of god to other cities because for this i was sent
44  so he went on preaching in the synagogues of judeʹa
11  now he was in a certain place praying and when he stopped one of his disciples said to him lord teach us how to pray just as john also taught his disciples
2  so he said to them whenever you pray say father let your name be sanctified
let your kingdom come
3  give us each day our bread according to our daily needs
4  and forgive us our sins for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is in debt to us and do not bring us into temptation
5  then he said to them suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him friend lend me three loaves
6  because one of my friends has just come to me on a journey and i have nothing to offer him
7  but that one replies from inside stop bothering me
the door is already locked and my young children are with me in bed
i cannot get up and give you anything
8  i tell you even if he will not get up and give him anything because of being his friend certainly because of his bold persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs
9  so i say to you keep on asking and it will be given you keep on seeking and you will find keep on knocking and it will be opened to you
10  for everyone asking receives and everyone seeking finds and to everyone knocking it will be opened
11  indeed which father among you if his son asks for a fish will hand him a serpent instead of a fish
12  or if he also asks for an egg will hand him a scorpion
13  therefore if you although being wicked know how to give good gifts to your children how much more so will the father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him
14  later he expelled a speechless demon
after the demon came out the speechless man spoke and the crowds were amazed
15  but some of them said he expels the demons by means of beelʹzebub the ruler of the demons
16  and others to test him began demanding a sign out of heaven from him
17  knowing their thinking he said to them every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin and a house divided against itself falls
18  in the same way if satan is also divided against himself how will his kingdom stand for you say i expel the demons by means of beelʹzebub
19  if i expel the demons by means of beelʹzebub by whom do your sons expel them this is why they will be your judges
20  but if it is by means of gods finger that i expel the demons the kingdom of god has really overtaken you
21  when a strong wellarmed man guards his palace his belongings remain secure
22  but when someone stronger than he is comes against him and conquers him that man takes away all his weapons in which he was trusting and he divides up the things he took from him
23  whoever is not on my side is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
24  when an unclean spirit comes out of a man it passes through waterless places in search of a restingplace and after finding none it says i will return to my house from which i moved
25  and on arriving it finds the house swept clean and adorned
26  then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more wicked than itself and after getting inside they dwell there
so the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first
27  now as he was saying these things a woman from the crowd called out to him happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that nursed you
28  but he said no rather happy are those hearing the word of god and keeping it
29  when the crowds were massing together he began to say this generation is a wicked generation it looks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of joʹnah
30  for just as joʹnah became a sign to the ninʹevites so will the son of man be to this generation
31  the queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solʹomon
but look something more than solʹomon is here
32  the men of ninʹeveh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it because they repented at what joʹnah preached
but look something more than joʹnah is here
33  after lighting a lamp a person puts it not in a hidden place nor under a basket but on the lampstand so that those who come in may see the light
34  the lamp of the body is your eye
when your eye is focused your whole body is also bright but when it is envious your body is also dark
35  be alert therefore that the light that is in you is not darkness
36  therefore if your whole body is bright with no part of it dark it will all be as bright as when a lamp gives you light by its rays
37  when he had said this a pharisee asked him to dine with him
so he went in and reclined at the table
38  however the pharisee was surprised at seeing that he did not first wash before the dinner
39  but the lord said to him now you pharisees you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish but inside you are full of greediness and wickedness
40  unreasonable ones the one who made the outside made also the inside did he not
41  but give as gifts of mercy the things that are from within and look everything about you will be clean
42  but woe to you pharisees because you give the tenth of the mint and of the rue and of every other garden herb but you disregard the justice and the love of god these things you were under obligation to do but not to disregard those other things
43  woe to you pharisees because you love the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces
44  woe to you because you are as those graves that are not clearly visible that men walk on and do not know it
45  in reply one of those versed in the law said to him teacher in saying these things you insult us also
46  then he said woe also to you who are versed in the law because you load men down with loads hard to carry but you yourselves do not touch the loads with one of your fingers
47  woe to you because you build the tombs of the prophets but your forefathers killed them
48  certainly you are witnesses of the deeds of your forefathers and yet you approve of them for they killed the prophets but you are building their tombs
49  that is why the wisdom of god also said i will send prophets and apostles to them and they will kill and persecute some of them
50  so that the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world may be charged against this generation
51  from the blood of abel down to the blood of zechariʹah who was killed between the altar and the house
yes i tell you it will be charged against this generation
52  woe to you who are versed in the law because you took away the key of knowledge
you yourselves did not go in and you hinder those going in
53  so when he went out from there the scribes and the pharisees began to put extreme pressure on him and to ply him with many more questions
54  lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say
8  shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of god
and the twelve were with him
2  as were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses mary who was called magʹdalene from whom seven demons had come out
3  joanʹna the wife of chuʹza herods man in charge susanʹna and many other women who were ministering to them from their belongings
4  now when a large crowd had gathered together with those who went to him from city to city he spoke by means of an illustration
5  a sower went out to sow his seed
as he was sowing some of them fell alongside the road and were trampled on and the birds of heaven ate them up
6  some landed on the rock and after sprouting they dried up because they had no moisture
7  others fell among the thorns and the thorns that grew up with them choked them
8  but others fell on the good soil and after sprouting they produced 100 times more fruit
as he said these things he called out let the one who has ears to listen listen
9  but his disciples asked him what this illustration meant
10  he said to you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the kingdom of god but for the rest it is in illustrations so that though looking they may look in vain and though hearing they may not get the sense
11  now the illustration means this the seed is the word of god
12  those alongside the road are the ones who have heard and then the devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved
13  those on the rock are the ones who when they hear the word receive it with joy but these have no root
they believe for a while but in a season of testing they fall away
14  as for that which fell among the thorns these are the ones who have heard but by being carried away by anxieties riches and pleasures of this life they are completely choked and bring nothing to maturity
15  as for that on the fine soil these are the ones who after hearing the word with a fine and good heart retain it and bear fruit with endurance
16  no one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light
17  for there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest nor anything carefully concealed that will never become known and not come out in the open
18  therefore pay attention to how you listen for whoever has will be given more but whoever does not have even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him
19  now his mother and brothers came to him but they were unable to get near him because of the crowd
20  so it was reported to him your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you
21  in reply he said to them my mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of god and do it
22  one day he and his disciples got into a boat and he said to them let us cross to the other side of the lake
so they set sail
23  but as they were sailing along he fell asleep
and a violent windstorm descended on the lake and their boat began to fill up with water and to be in danger
24  so they went and woke him up saying instructor instructor we are about to perish with that he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they subsided and a calm set in
25  then he said to them where is your faith but they were filled with fear and were astounded saying to one another who really is this for he orders even the winds and the water and they obey him
26  and they put in to shore in the region of the gerʹasenes which is on the side opposite galʹilee
27  as jesus got out onto land a demonpossessed man from the city met him
for a considerable time he had not worn clothing and he was staying not in a house but among the tombs
28  at the sight of jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice he said what have i to do with you jesus son of the most high god i beg you do not torment me
29  for jesus had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man
it had seized him on many occasions and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the isolated places
30  jesus asked him what is your name he said legion for many demons had entered into him
31  and they kept pleading with him not to order them to go away into the abyss
32  now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain so they pleaded with him to permit them to enter into the swine and he gave them permission
33  with that the demons came out of the man and went into the swine and the herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and drowned
34  but when the herders saw what had happened they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside
35  then people went out to see what had happened
they came to jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out clothed and in his right mind sitting at the feet of jesus and they grew fearful
36  those who had seen it reported to them how the demonpossessed man had been made well
37  then a great number from the surrounding region of the gerʹasenes asked jesus to go away from them because they were gripped by great fear
then he went aboard the boat to depart
38  however the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging to continue with him but he sent the man away saying
39  go back home and keep on relating what god did for you
so he went away proclaiming throughout the whole city what jesus had done for him
40  when jesus returned the crowd received him kindly for they were all expecting him
41  but look a man named jaʹirus came this man was a presiding officer of the synagogue
and he fell at the feet of jesus and began to plead with him to come to his house
42  because his only daughter who was about 12 years old was dying
as jesus was going the crowds pressed in on him
43  now there was a woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years and she had not been able to get a cure from anyone
44  she approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment and immediately her flow of blood stopped
45  so jesus said who touched me when they were all denying it peter said instructor the crowds are hemming you in and pressing against you
46  but jesus said someone touched me for i know that power went out of me
47  seeing that she had not escaped notice the woman came trembling and fell down before him and declared before all the people why she touched him and how she was healed immediately
48  but he said to her daughter your faith has made you well
go in peace
49  while he was yet speaking a representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came saying your daughter has died do not bother the teacher any longer
50  on hearing this jesus answered him have no fear only have faith and she will be saved
51  when he reached the house he did not let anyone go in with him except peter john james and the girls father and mother
52  but people were all weeping and beating themselves in grief for her
so he said stop weeping for she did not die but is sleeping
53  at this they began to laugh at him scornfully because they knew she had died
54  but he took her by the hand and called to her child get up
55  and her spirit returned and she rose immediately and he ordered that something be given her to eat
56  well her parents were beside themselves but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened
16  then he also said to the disciples a rich man had a steward who was accused of handling his goods wastefully
2  so he called him and said what is this i hear about you hand in the account of your stewardship for you can no longer manage the house
3  then the steward said to himself what am i to do seeing that my master is taking the stewardship away from me i am not strong enough to dig and i am ashamed to beg
4  ah i know what i will do so that when i am removed from the stewardship people will welcome me into their homes
5  and calling to him each one of his masters debtors he said to the first how much do you owe my master
6  he replied a hundred measures of olive oil
he said to him take back your written agreement and sit down and quickly write 50
7  next he said to another one now you how much do you owe he said a hundred large measures of wheat
he said to him take back your written agreement and write 80
8  and his master commended the steward though unrighteous because he acted with practical wisdom for the sons of this system of things are wiser in a practical way toward their own generation than the sons of the light are
9  also i say to you make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches so that when such fail they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places
10  the person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much
11  therefore if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with the unrighteous riches who will entrust you with what is true
12  and if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with what belongs to another who will give you something for yourselves
13  no servant can be a slave to two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will stick to the one and despise the other
you cannot be slaves to god and to riches
14  now the pharisees who were money lovers were listening to all these things and they began to sneer at him
15  so he said to them you are those who declare yourselves righteous before men but god knows your hearts
for what is considered exalted by men is a disgusting thing in gods sight
16  the law and the prophets were until john
from then on the kingdom of god is being declared as good news and every sort of person is pressing forward toward it
17  indeed it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to go unfulfilled
18  everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery
19  there was a rich man who used to dress in purple and linen enjoying himself day after day with magnificence
20  but a beggar named lazʹarus used to be put at his gate covered with ulcers
21  and desiring to be filled with the things dropping from the table of the rich man
yes even the dogs would come and lick his ulcers
22  now in the course of time the beggar died and was carried off by the angels to abrahams side
also the rich man died and was buried
23  and in the grave he lifted up his eyes being in torment and he saw abraham from afar and lazʹarus by his side
24  so he called and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazʹarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in anguish in this blazing fire
25  but abraham said child remember that you had your fill of good things in your lifetime but lazʹarus for his part received bad things
now however he is being comforted here but you are in anguish
26  and besides all these things a great chasm has been fixed between us and you so that those who want to go over from here to you cannot neither may people cross over from there to us
27  then he said that being so i ask you father to send him to the house of my father
28  for i have five brothers in order that he may give them a thorough witness so that they will not also come into this place of torment
29  but abraham said they have moses and the prophets let them listen to these
30  then he said no indeed father abraham but if someone from the dead goes to them they will repent
31  but he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead
18  then he went on to tell them an illustration about the need for them always to pray and not to give up
2  saying in a certain city there was a judge who had no fear of god and no respect for man
3  there was also a widow in that city who kept going to him and saying see that i get justice from my legal opponent
4  well for a while he was unwilling but afterward he said to himself although i do not fear god or respect any man
5  because this widow keeps making me trouble i will see that she gets justice so that she will not keep coming and wearing me out with her demand
6  then the lord said hear what the judge although unrighteous said
7  certainly then will not god cause justice to be done for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night while he is patient toward them
8  i tell you he will cause justice to be done to them speedily
nevertheless when the son of man arrives will he really find this faith on the earth
9  he also told this illustration to some who trusted in their own righteousness and who considered others as nothing
10  two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a tax collector
11  the pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself o god i thank you that i am not like everyone elseextortioners unrighteous adulterersor even like this tax collector
12  i fast twice a week i give the tenth of all things i acquire
13  but the tax collector standing at a distance was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward but kept beating his chest saying o god be gracious to me a sinner
14  i tell you this man went down to his home and was proved more righteous than that pharisee
because everyone who exalts himself will be humiliated but whoever humbles himself will be exalted
15  now people were also bringing him their infants for him to touch them but on seeing this the disciples began to reprimand them
16  however jesus called the infants to him saying let the young children come to me and do not try to stop them for the kingdom of god belongs to such ones
17  truly i say to you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god like a young child will by no means enter into it
18  and one of the rulers questioned him saying good teacher what must i do to inherit everlasting life
19  jesus said to him why do you call me good nobody is good except one god
20  you know the commandments do not commit adultery do not murder do not steal do not bear false witness honor your father and your mother
21  then he said all of these i have kept from youth on
22  after hearing that jesus said to him there is still one thing lacking about you sell all the things you have and distribute the proceeds to the poor and you will have treasure in the heavens and come be my follower
23  when he heard this he became deeply grieved for he was very rich
24  jesus looked at him and said how difficult it will be for those having money to make their way into the kingdom of god
25  it is easier in fact for a camel to get through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
26  those who heard this said who possibly can be saved
27  he said the things impossible with men are possible with god
28  but peter said look we have left what was ours and followed you
29  he said to them truly i say to you there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god
30  who will not get many times more in this period of time and in the coming system of things everlasting life
31  then he took the twelve aside and said to them look we are going up to jerusalem and all the things written by means of the prophets about the son of man will be accomplished
32  for instance he will be handed over to men of the nations and will be mocked and treated insolently and spat on
33  and after scourging him they will kill him but on the third day he will rise
34  however they did not get the meaning of any of these things for these words were hidden from them and they did not understand the things said
35  now as jesus was getting near to jerʹicho a blind man was sitting beside the road begging
36  because he heard a crowd passing by he began to inquire what was going on
37  they reported to him jesus the nazareneʹ is passing by
38  at that he cried out jesus son of david have mercy on me
39  and those who were in front began rebuking him telling him to keep quiet but all the more he kept shouting son of david have mercy on me
40  then jesus stopped and commanded that the man be brought to him
after he came near jesus asked him
41  what do you want me to do for you he said lord let me recover my sight
42  so jesus said to him recover your sight your faith has made you well
43  and instantly he recovered his sight and he began to follow him glorifying god
also at seeing it all the people gave praise to god
17  then he said to his disciples it is unavoidable that causes for stumbling should come
nevertheless woe to the one through whom they come
2  it would be more advantageous for him if a millstone were hung from his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to stumble one of these little ones
3  pay attention to yourselves
if your brother commits a sin rebuke him and if he repents forgive him
4  even if he sins seven times a day against you and he comes back to you seven times saying i repent you must forgive him
5  now the apostles said to the lord give us more faith
6  then the lord said if you had faith the size of a mustard grain you would say to this black mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you
7  which one of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding would say to him when he comes in from the field come here at once and dine at the table
8  rather will he not say to him get something ready for me to have my evening meal and put on an apron and serve me until i finish eating and drinking and afterward you can eat and drink
9  he will not feel gratitude to the slave because he did what was assigned will he
10  likewise when you have done all the things assigned to you say we are goodfornothing slaves
what we have done is what we ought to have done
11  while he was going to jerusalem he was passing between samarʹia and galʹilee
12  and as he was entering a village ten men with leprosy met him but they stood at a distance
13  and they raised their voices and said jesus instructor have mercy on us
14  when he saw them he said to them go and show yourselves to the priests
then as they were going off they were cleansed
15  one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back glorifying god with a loud voice
16  and he fell facedown at jesus feet thanking him
furthermore he was a samarʹitan
17  in reply jesus said all ten were cleansed were they not where then are the other nine
18  did no one else turn back to give glory to god except this man of another nation
19  then he said to him get up and be on your way your faith has made you well
20  on being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god was coming he answered them the kingdom of god is not coming with striking observableness
21  nor will people say see here or there for look the kingdom of god is in your midst
22  then he said to the disciples days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the son of man but you will not see it
23  and people will say to you see there or see here do not go out or chase after them
24  for just as lightning flashes from one part of heaven to another part of heaven so the son of man will be in his day
25  first however he must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by this generation
26  moreover just as it occurred in the days of noah so it will be in the days of the son of man
27  they were eating they were drinking men were marrying women were being given in marriage until that day when noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all
28  likewise just as it occurred in the days of lot they were eating they were drinking they were buying they were selling they were planting they were building
29  but on the day that lot went out of sodʹom it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all
30  it will be the same on that day when the son of man is revealed
31  on that day let the person who is on the housetop but whose belongings are in the house not come down to pick these up and likewise the person out in the field must not return to the things behind
32  remember the wife of lot
33  whoever seeks to keep his life safe will lose it but whoever loses it will preserve it alive
34  i tell you in that night two people will be in one bed the one will be taken along but the other will be abandoned
35  there will be two women grinding at the same mill the one will be taken along but the other will be abandoned
36  
37  so in response they said to him where lord he said to them where the body is there also the eagles will be gathered together
9  then he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases
2  and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of god and to heal
3  and he said to them carry nothing for the trip neither staff nor food pouch nor bread nor money neither have two garments
4  but wherever you enter into a home stay there and leave from there
5  and wherever people do not receive you on going out of that city shake the dust off your feet for a witness against them
6  then starting out they went through the territory from village to village declaring the good news and performing cures everywhere
7  now herod the district ruler heard about everything that was happening and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying that john had been raised up from the dead
8  but others were saying that eliʹjah had appeared and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen
9  herod said john i beheaded
who then is this about whom i am hearing such things so he was trying to see him
10  when the apostles returned they reported to jesus all they had done
with that he took them along and withdrew privately into a city called bethsaʹida
11  but the crowds getting to know it followed him
and he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the kingdom of god and he healed those needing a cure
12  then the day was coming to a close
the twelve now came up and said to him send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and provisions because out here we are in an isolated place
13  but he said to them you give them something to eat
they said we have nothing more than five loaves and two fish unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy food for all these people
14  there were in fact about 5000 men
but he said to his disciples have them sit down in groups of about 50 each
15  and they did so and had them all sit down
16  taking now the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and blessed them
then he broke them up and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd
17  so they all ate and were satisfied and they took up the leftovers 12 baskets of fragments
18  later while he was praying alone the disciples came to him and he questioned them saying who are the crowds saying that i am
19  in reply they said john the baptist but others say eliʹjah and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen
20  then he said to them you though who do you say i am peter answered the christ of god
21  then in a stern talk to them he instructed them not to tell this to anybody
22  but he said the son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised up
23  then he went on to say to all if anyone wants to come after me let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and keep following me
24  for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake is the one who will save it
25  really what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers ruin
26  for whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words the son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and that of the father and of the holy angels
27  but i tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the kingdom of god
28  in fact about eight days after saying these words he took peter john and james along and climbed up the mountain to pray
29  and as he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became glitteringly white
30  and look two men were conversing with him they were moses and eliʹjah
31  these appeared with glory and began talking about his departure which he was about to fulfill at jerusalem
32  now peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men standing with him
33  and as these were departing from him peter said to jesus instructor it is fine for us to be here
so let us erect three tents one for you one for moses and one for eliʹjah
he did not realize what he was saying
34  but as he was saying these things a cloud formed and began to overshadow them
as they entered into the cloud they became afraid
35  then a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my son the one who has been chosen
listen to him
36  as the voice spoke jesus was found alone
but they kept quiet and did not report to anyone in those days any of the things they saw
37  the following day when they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him
38  and look a man called out from the crowd saying teacher i beg you to take a look at my son because he is my only one
39  and look a spirit seizes him and suddenly he cries out and it throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth and only with difficulty does it leave him after bruising him
40  i begged your disciples to expel it but they could not
41  in response jesus said o faithless and twisted generation how long must i continue with you and put up with you bring your son over here
42  but even as he was approaching the demon hurled him to the ground and violently threw him into a convulsion
however jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father
43  and they were all astounded at the majestic power of god
while they were all astonished at all the things he was doing he said to his disciples
44  listen carefully and remember these words for the son of man is going to be betrayed into mens hands
45  but they did not understand what he was saying
in fact it was concealed from them so that they might not grasp it and they were afraid to question him about this saying
46  then a dispute arose among them about which one of them was the greatest
47  jesus knowing the reasoning of their hearts took a young child stood him beside him
48  and said to them whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me also and whoever receives me also receives the one who sent me
for the one who conducts himself as a lesser one among all of you is the one who is great
49  in response john said instructor we saw someone expelling demons by using your name and we tried to prevent him because he is not following with us
50  but jesus said to him do not try to prevent him for whoever is not against you is for you
51  as the days were drawing near for him to be taken up he resolutely set his face to go to jerusalem
52  so he sent messengers ahead of him
and they went and entered a village of samarʹitans to make preparations for him
53  but they did not receive him because he was determined to go to jerusalem
54  when the disciples james and john saw this they said lord do you want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them
55  but he turned and rebuked them
56  so they went to a different village
57  now as they were going along the road someone said to him i will follow you wherever you go
58  but jesus said to him foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay down his head
59  then he said to another be my follower
the man said lord permit me first to go and bury my father
60  but he said to him let the dead bury their dead but you go and declare abroad the kingdom of god
61  and still another said i will follow you lord but first permit me to say goodbye to those in my household
62  jesus said to him no man who has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is wellsuited for the kingdom of god
7  when he had completed what he had to say to the people he entered caperʹnaum
2  now an army officers slave who was dear to him was seriously ill and about to pass away
3  when he heard about jesus he sent some elders of the jews to him to ask him to come and make his slave well
4  they came up to jesus and began to plead with him earnestly saying he is worthy of your granting him this
5  for he loves our nation and he himself built our synagogue
6  so jesus went with them
but when he was not far from the house the army officer had already sent friends to say to him sir do not bother for i am not worthy to have you come under my roof
7  that is why i did not consider myself worthy to come to you
but say the word and let my servant be healed
8  for i too am a man placed under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and he does it
9  when jesus heard these things he was amazed at him and he turned to the crowd following him and said i tell you not even in israel have i found so great a faith
10  and when those who had been sent returned to the house they found the slave in good health
11  soon afterward he traveled to a city called naʹin and his disciples and a large crowd were traveling with him
12  as he got near the gate of the city why look there was a dead man being carried out the only son of his mother
besides she was a widow
a considerable crowd from the city was also with her
13  when the lord caught sight of her he was moved with pity for her and he said to her stop weeping
14  with that he approached and touched the bier and the bearers stood still
then he said young man i say to you get up
15  and the dead man sat up and started to speak and jesus gave him to his mother
16  now fear seized them all and they began to glorify god saying a great prophet has been raised up among us and god has turned his attention to his people
17  and this news concerning him spread out into all judeʹa and all the surrounding country
18  now johns disciples reported to him all these things
19  so john summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the lord to ask are you the coming one or are we to expect a different one
20  when they came to him the men said john the baptist sent us to you to ask are you the coming one or are we to expect another
21  in that hour he cured many people of sicknesses serious diseases and wicked spirits and he granted many blind people the gift of sight
22  in reply he said to them go and report to john what you have seen and heard the blind are now seeing the lame are walking the lepers are being cleansed the deaf are hearing the dead are being raised up and the poor are being told the good news
23  happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me
24  when the messengers of john had gone away jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to see a reed being tossed by the wind
25  what then did you go out to see a man dressed in soft garments why those wearing splendid dress and living in luxury are in royal houses
26  really then what did you go out to see a prophet yes i tell you and far more than a prophet
27  this is the one about whom it is written look i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way ahead of you
28  i tell you among those born of women there is no one greater than john but a lesser person in the kingdom of god is greater than he is
29  when all the people and the tax collectors heard this they declared god to be righteous for they had been baptized with the baptism of john
30  but the pharisees and those versed in the law disregarded the counsel of god to them since they had not been baptized by him
31  with whom therefore should i compare the men of this generation and whom are they like
32  they are like young children sitting in a marketplace and calling out to one another saying we played the flute for you but you did not dance we wailed but you did not weep
33  likewise john the baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine but you say he has a demon
34  the son of man has come eating and drinking but you say look a man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine a friend of tax collectors and sinners
35  all the same wisdom is proved righteous by all its children
36  now one of the pharisees kept asking him to dine with him
so he entered the house of the pharisee and reclined at the table
37  and look a woman who was known in the city to be a sinner learned that he was dining in the house of the pharisee and she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil
38  taking a position behind him at his feet she wept and began to wet his feet with her tears and she wiped them off with the hair of her head
also she tenderly kissed his feet and poured the perfumed oil on them
39  seeing this the pharisee who had invited him said to himself if this man were really a prophet he would know who and what kind of woman it is who is touching him that she is a sinner
40  but in reply jesus said to him simon i have something to say to you
he said teacher say it
41  two men were debtors to a certain lender the one was in debt for 500 denarʹii but the other for 50
42  when they did not have anything to pay him back with he freely forgave them both
therefore which one of them will love him more
43  in answer simon said i suppose it is the one whom he forgave more
he said to him you judged correctly
44  with that he turned to the woman and said to simon do you see this woman i entered your house you gave me no water for my feet
but this woman wet my feet with her tears and wiped them off with her hair
45  you gave me no kiss but this woman from the hour that i came in did not stop tenderly kissing my feet
46  you did not pour oil on my head but this woman poured perfumed oil on my feet
47  because of this i tell you her sins many though they are are forgiven because she loved much
but the one who is forgiven little loves little
48  then he said to her your sins are forgiven
49  those reclining at the table with him started to say among themselves who is this man who even forgives sins
50  but he said to the woman your faith has saved you go in peace
23  so the multitude got up one and all and led him to pilate
2  then they began to accuse him saying we found this man subverting our nation forbidding the paying of taxes to caesar and saying he himself is christ a king
3  now pilate asked him the question are you the king of the jews in answer he said you yourself are saying it
4  then pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds i find no crime in this man
5  but they insisted saying he stirs up the people by teaching throughout all judeʹa starting from galʹilee even to here
6  on hearing that pilate asked whether the man was a galileʹan
7  after ascertaining that he was under the jurisdiction of herod he sent him on to herod who was also in jerusalem in those days
8  when herod saw jesus he rejoiced greatly
for a considerable time he had been wanting to see jesus because he had heard much about him and he was hoping to see some sign performed by him
9  so he began to question him at length but he gave him no answer
10  however the chief priests and the scribes kept standing up and vehemently accusing him
11  then herod together with his soldiers treated him with contempt and he mocked him by clothing him with a splendid garment and then sent him back to pilate
12  herod and pilate became friends with each other on that very day for before that they had been at enmity with each other
13  pilate then called together the chief priests the rulers and the people
14  and said to them you brought this man to me as one inciting the people to revolt
now look i examined him in front of you but found in this man no grounds for the charges you are bringing against him
15  in fact neither did herod for he sent him back to us and look he has done nothing deserving of death
16  i will therefore punish him and release him
17  
18  but the whole crowd shouted out do away with this man and release barabʹbas to us
19  this man had been thrown into prison for sedition that had occurred in the city and for murder
20  again pilate called out to them because he wanted to release jesus
21  then they began to yell saying to the stake with him to the stake with him
22  the third time he said to them why what bad thing did this man do i found in him nothing deserving of death i will therefore punish him and release him
23  at this they became insistent demanding with loud voices that he be executed and their voices prevailed
24  so pilate made the decision that their demand be met
25  he released the man whom they were demanding who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder but he surrendered jesus to their will
26  now as they led him away they seized a certain simon of cyreʹne who was coming from the countryside and they placed the torture stake on him to carry it behind jesus
27  a large number of people were following him including women who kept beating themselves in grief and wailing for him
28  jesus turned to the women and said daughters of jerusalem stop weeping for me
weep instead for yourselves and for your children
29  for look days are coming when people will say happy are the barren women the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse
30  then they will start saying to the mountains fall over us and to the hills cover us over
31  if they do these things when the tree is moist what will occur when it is withered
32  two other men criminals were also being led off to be executed with him
33  and when they got to the place called skull they nailed him to the stake there alongside the criminals one on his right and one on his left
34  but jesus was saying father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing
furthermore they cast lots to distribute his garments
35  and the people stood looking on
but the rulers were sneering and saying others he saved let him save himself if he is the christ of god the chosen one
36  even the soldiers mocked him coming up and offering him sour wine
37  and saying if you are the king of the jews save yourself
38  there was also an inscription over him this is the king of the jews
39  then one of the criminals hanging there began to speak abusively to him saying you are the christ are you not save yourself and us too
40  in response the other rebuked him saying do you not fear god at all now that you have received the same judgment
41  and we rightly so for we are getting back what we deserve for the things we did but this man did nothing wrong
42  then he said jesus remember me when you get into your kingdom
43  and he said to him truly i tell you today you will be with me in paradise
44  well by now it was about the sixth hour and yet a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour
45  because the sunlight failed then the curtain of the sanctuary was torn down the middle
46  and jesus called out with a loud voice and said father into your hands i entrust my spirit
after he said this he expired
47  because of seeing what occurred the army officer began to glorify god saying truly this man was righteous
48  and when all the crowds that were gathered together there for this spectacle saw the things that occurred they returned home beating their chests
49  and all those acquainted with him were standing at a distance
also women who had accompanied him from galʹilee were there and saw these things
50  and look there was a man named joseph a member of the council who was a good and righteous man
51  this man had not voted in support of their scheme and action
he was from arimatheʹa a city of the judeʹans and was waiting for the kingdom of god
52  this man went in before pilate and asked for the body of jesus
53  and he took it down and wrapped it up in fine linen and he laid it in a tomb carved in the rock where no man had yet lain
54  now it was the day of preparation and the sabbath was about to begin
55  but the women who had come with him from galʹilee followed along and took a look at the tomb and saw how his body was laid
56  and they went back to prepare spices and perfumed oils
but of course they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment
22  now the festival of the unleavened bread which is called passover was getting near
2  and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for an effective way to get rid of him because they were afraid of the people
3  then satan entered into judas the one called iscarʹiot who was numbered among the twelve
4  and he went off and talked with the chief priests and temple captains about how to betray him to them
5  they were delighted at this and agreed to give him silver money
6  so he consented and began looking for a good opportunity to betray him to them without a crowd around
7  the day of the unleavened bread now arrived on which the passover sacrifice must be offered
8  so jesus sent peter and john saying go and get the passover ready for us to eat
9  they said to him where do you want us to get it ready
10  he said to them look when you enter into the city a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you
follow him into the house that he enters
11  and say to the landlord of the house the teacher says to you where is the guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples
12  and that man will show you a large furnished upper room
get it ready there
13  so they left and found it just as he had told them and they prepared for the passover
14  so when the hour came he reclined at the table along with the apostles
15  and he said to them i have greatly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer
16  for i tell you i will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god
17  and accepting a cup he gave thanks and said take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves
18  for i tell you from now on i will not drink again from the product of the vine until the kingdom of god comes
19  also he took a loaf gave thanks broke it and gave it to them saying this means my body which is to be given in your behalf
keep doing this in remembrance of me
20  also he did the same with the cup after they had the evening meal saying this cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood which is to be poured out in your behalf
21  but look the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table
22  for indeed the son of man is going his way according to what has been determined all the same woe to that man through whom he is betrayed
23  so they began to discuss among themselves which one of them could really be about to do this
24  however there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered to be the greatest
25  but he said to them the kings of the nations lord it over them and those having authority over them are called benefactors
26  you though are not to be that way
but let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest and the one taking the lead as the one ministering
27  for which one is greater the one dining or the one serving is it not the one dining but i am among you as the one serving
28  however you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials
29  and i make a covenant with you just as my father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom
30  so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones to judge the 12 tribes of israel
31  simon simon look satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat
32  but i have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out and you once you have returned strengthen your brothers
33  then he said to him lord i am ready to go with you both to prison and to death
34  but he said i tell you peter a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times
35  he also said to them when i sent you out without a money bag and a food pouch and sandals you did not lack anything did you they said no
36  then he said to them but now let the one who has a money bag take it likewise a food pouch and let the one who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one
37  for i tell you that what is written must be accomplished in me namely he was counted with lawless ones
for this is being fulfilled concerning me
38  then they said lord look here are two swords
he said to them it is enough
39  on leaving he went as was his custom to the mount of olives and the disciples also followed him
40  on arriving at the place he said to them carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation
41  and he withdrew from them about a stones throw away and he bent his knees and began to pray
42  saying father if you want to remove this cup from me
nevertheless let not my will but yours take place
43  then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him
44  but he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground
45  when he rose from prayer and went to the disciples he found them slumbering exhausted from grief
46  he said to them why are you sleeping get up and keep praying so that you do not enter into temptation
47  while he was still speaking look a crowd and the man called judas one of the twelve was leading them and he approached jesus to kiss him
48  but jesus said to him judas are you betraying the son of man with a kiss
49  when those around him saw what was going to happen they said lord should we strike with the sword
50  one of them even struck the slave of the high priest taking off his right ear
51  but in reply jesus said that is enough
and he touched the ear and healed him
52  jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come there for him did you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber
53  while i was with you in the temple day after day you did not lay your hands on me
but this is your hour and the authority of darkness
54  then they arrested him and led him off and they brought him into the house of the high priest but peter was following at a distance
55  when they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together peter was sitting among them
56  but a servant girl seeing him sitting in the light of the fire looked closely at him and said this man was also with him
57  but he denied it saying i do not know him woman
58  after a short time another person saw him and said you too are one of them
but peter said man i am not
59  and after about an hour had passed another man began insisting strongly certainly this man was also with him for he is in fact a galileʹan
60  but peter said man i do not know what you are saying
and instantly while he was still speaking a rooster crowed
61  at this the lord turned and looked straight at peter and peter recalled the statement of the lord when he had said to him before a rooster crows today you will disown me three times
62  and he went outside and wept bitterly
63  now the men who held jesus in custody began to mock him hitting him
64  and after covering his face they kept asking prophesy who is it that struck you
65  and they said many other blasphemous things against him
66  and when it became day the assembly of elders of the people both chief priests and scribes gathered together and they led him into their sanʹhedrin hall and said
67  if you are the christ tell us
but he said to them even if i told you you would not believe it at all
68  moreover if i questioned you you would not answer
69  however from now on the son of man will be seated at the powerful right hand of god
70  at this they all said are you therefore the son of god he said to them you yourselves are saying that i am
71  they said why do we need further testimony for we ourselves have heard it out of his own mouth
6  now on a sabbath he was passing through grainfields and his disciples were plucking and eating the heads of grain rubbing them with their hands
2  at this some of the pharisees said why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath
3  but in reply jesus said to them have you never read what david did when he and the men with him were hungry
4  how he entered into the house of god and received the loaves of presentation and ate and gave some to the men with him which it is not lawful for anyone to eat but for the priests only
5  then he said to them the son of man is lord of the sabbath
6  on another sabbath he entered the synagogue and began teaching
and a man was there whose right hand was withered
7  the scribes and the pharisees were now watching jesus closely to see whether he would cure on the sabbath in order to find some way to accuse him
8  he however knew their reasoning so he said to the man with the withered hand get up and stand in the center
and he rose and stood there
9  then jesus said to them i ask you men is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm to save a life or to destroy it
10  after looking around at them all he said to the man stretch out your hand
he did so and his hand was restored
11  but they flew into a senseless rage and they began to talk over with one another what they might do to jesus
12  on one of those days he went out to the mountain to pray and he spent the whole night in prayer to god
13  and when it became day he called his disciples to him and chose from among them 12 whom he also named apostles
14  simon whom he also named peter andrew his brother james john philip bartholʹomew
15  matthew thomas james the son of alphaeʹus simon who is called the zealous one
16  judas the son of james and judas iscarʹiot who turned traitor
17  and he came down with them and stood on a level place and there was a large crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all judeʹa and jerusalem and the coastal region of tyre and siʹdon who came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses
18  even those troubled with unclean spirits were cured
19  and all the crowd were seeking to touch him because power was going out of him and healing them all
20  and he looked up at his disciples and began to say happy are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of god
21  happy are you who hunger now for you will be filled
happy are you who weep now for you will laugh
22  happy are you whenever men hate you and when they exclude you and reproach you and denounce your name as wicked for the sake of the son of man
23  rejoice in that day and leap for joy for look your reward is great in heaven for those are the same things their forefathers used to do to the prophets
24  but woe to you who are rich for you are having your consolation in full
25  woe to you who are filled up now for you will go hungry
woe you who are laughing now for you will mourn and weep
26  woe whenever all men speak well of you for this is what their forefathers did to the false prophets
27  but i say to you who are listening continue to love your enemies to do good to those hating you
28  to bless those cursing you to pray for those who are insulting you
29  to him who strikes you on the one cheek offer the other also and from him who takes away your outer garment do not withhold the inner garment either
30  give to everyone asking you and from the one taking your things away do not ask them back
31  also just as you want men to do to you do the same way to them
32  if you love those loving you of what credit is it to you for even the sinners love those loving them
33  and if you do good to those doing good to you of what credit is it to you even the sinners do the same
34  also if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment of what credit is it to you even sinners lend to sinners so that they may get back as much
35  on the contrary continue to love your enemies and to do good and to lend without hoping for anything back and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the most high for he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked
36  continue being merciful just as your father is merciful
37  moreover stop judging and you will by no means be judged and stop condemning and you will by no means be condemned
keep on forgiving and you will be forgiven
38  practice giving and people will give to you
they will pour into your laps a fine measure pressed down shaken together and overflowing
for with the measure that you are measuring out they will measure out to you in return
39  then he also told them an illustration a blind man cannot guide a blind man can he both will fall into a pit will they not
40  a student is not above his teacher but everyone who is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher
41  why then do you look at the straw in your brothers eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye
42  how can you say to your brother brother allow me to remove the straw that is in your eye while you yourself do not see the rafter in your own eye hypocrite first remove the rafter from your own eye and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw that is in your brothers eye
43  for no fine tree produces rotten fruit and no rotten tree produces fine fruit
44  for each tree is known by its own fruit
for example people do not gather figs from thorns nor do they cut grapes off a thornbush
45  a good man brings good out of the good treasure of his heart but a wicked man brings what is wicked out of his wicked treasure for out of the hearts abundance his mouth speaks
46  why then do you call me lord lord but do not do the things i say
47  everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them i will show you whom he is like
48  he is like a man who in building a house dug and went down deep and laid a foundation on the rock
consequently when a flood came the river dashed against that house but was not strong enough to shake it for it was wellbuilt
49  on the other hand whoever hears and does nothing is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation
the river dashed against it and immediately it collapsed and the ruin of that house was great
21  now as he looked up he saw the rich dropping their gifts into the treasury chests
2  then he saw a needy widow drop in two small coins of very little value
3  and he said truly i say to you that this poor widow put in more than they all did
4  for all of these put in gifts out of their surplus but she out of her want put in all the means of living she had
5  later when some were speaking about the temple how it was adorned with fine stones and dedicated things
6  he said as for these things that you now see the days will come when not a stone will be left upon a stone and not be thrown down
7  then they questioned him saying teacher when will these things actually be and what will be the sign when these things are to occur
8  he said look out that you are not misled for many will come on the basis of my name saying i am he and the due time is near
do not go after them
9  furthermore when you hear of wars and disturbances do not be terrified
for these things must take place first but the end will not occur immediately
10  then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
11  there will be great earthquakes and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs
12  but before all these things happen people will lay their hands on you and persecute you handing you over to the synagogues and prisons
you will be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name
13  it will result in your giving a witness
14  therefore resolve in your hearts not to rehearse beforehand how to make your defense
15  for i will give you words and wisdom that all your opposers together will not be able to resist or dispute
16  moreover you will be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death
17  and you will be hated by all people because of my name
18  but not even a hair of your heads will perish
19  by your endurance you will preserve your lives
20  however when you see jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies then know that the desolating of her has drawn near
21  then let those in judeʹa begin fleeing to the mountains let those in the midst of her leave and let those in the countryside not enter into her
22  because these are days for meting out justice in order that all the things written may be fulfilled
23  woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days for there will be great distress on the land and wrath against this people
24  and they will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations and jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled
25  also there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars and on the earth anguish of nations not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation
26  people will become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth for the powers of the heavens will be shaken
27  and then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
28  but as these things start to occur stand up straight and lift up your heads because your deliverance is getting near
29  with that he told them an illustration notice the fig tree and all the other trees
30  when they are budding you see it for yourselves and know that now the summer is near
31  likewise also you when you see these things happening know that the kingdom of god is near
32  truly i say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all things happen
33  heaven and earth will pass away but my words will by no means pass away
34  but pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life and suddenly that day be instantly upon you
35  as a snare
for it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth
36  keep awake then all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that must occur and in standing before the son of man
37  so by day he would be teaching in the temple but by night he would go out and lodge on the mountain called the mount of olives
38  and all the people would come to him early in the morning to hear him in the temple
13  at that time some who were present reported to him about the galileʹans whose blood pilate had mixed with their sacrifices
2  in reply he said to them do you think that those galileʹans were worse sinners than all other galileʹans because they have suffered these things
3  no i tell you but unless you repent you will all likewise be destroyed
4  or those 18 on whom the tower in siloʹam fell killing themdo you think that they had greater guilt than all other men who live in jerusalem
5  no i tell you but unless you repent you will all be destroyed as they were
6  then he went on to tell this illustration a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it but found none
7  then he said to the vinedresser here it is three years that i have come looking for fruit on this fig tree but have found none
cut it down why should it keep the ground useless
8  in reply he said to him master leave it alone for one more year until i dig around it and put on manure
9  if it produces fruit in the future well and good but if not then cut it down
10  now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
11  and look a woman was there who had had a spirit of weakness for 18 years and she was bent double and was unable to straighten up at all
12  when he saw her jesus addressed her and said woman you are released from your weakness
13  and he laid his hands on her and instantly she straightened up and began to glorify god
14  but in response the presiding officer of the synagogue indignant because jesus did the cure on the sabbath said to the crowd there are six days on which work ought to be done so come and be cured on those days and not on the sabbath day
15  however the lord answered him hypocrites does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his bull or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to give it something to drink
16  should not this woman who is a daughter of abraham and whom satan held bound for 18 years be released from this bondage on the sabbath day
17  well when he said these things all his opposers began to feel shame but the entire crowd began to rejoice at all the glorious things he did
18  so he went on to say what is the kingdom of god like and with what can i compare it
19  it is like a mustard grain that a man took and planted in his garden and it grew and became a tree and the birds of heaven nested in its branches
20  and again he said with what can i compare the kingdom of god
21  it is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures of flour until the whole mass was fermented
22  and he traveled from city to city and from village to village teaching and continuing on his journey to jerusalem
23  now a man said to him lord are those being saved few he said to them
24  exert yourselves vigorously to get in through the narrow door because many i tell you will seek to get in but will not be able
25  when the householder gets up and locks the door you will stand outside knocking at the door saying lord open to us
but in answer he will say to you i do not know where you are from
26  then you will start saying we ate and drank in your presence and you taught in our main streets
27  but he will say to you i do not know where you are from
get away from me all you workers of unrighteousness
28  there is where your weeping and the gnashing of your teeth will be when you see abraham isaac jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god but you yourselves thrown outside
29  furthermore people will come from east and west and from north and south and will recline at the table in the kingdom of god
30  and look there are those last who will be first and there are those first who will be last
31  in that very hour some of the pharisees came up and told him get out and go away from here because herod wants to kill you
32  and he said to them go and tell that fox look i am casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow and on the third day i will be finished
33  nevertheless i must go on today tomorrow and the following day because it cannot be that a prophet should be put to death outside of jerusalem
34  jerusalem jerusalem the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent to herhow often i wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her brood of chicks under her wings but you did not want it
35  look your house is abandoned to you
i tell you you will by no means see me until you say blessed is the one who comes in jehovahs name
14  on another occasion he went to eat a meal in the house of one of the leaders of the pharisees on the sabbath and they were closely watching him
2  and look a man who had dropsy was in front of him
3  so in response jesus asked those versed in the law and the pharisees is it lawful to cure on the sabbath or not
4  but they kept silent
with that he took hold of the man healed him and sent him away
5  then he said to them who of you if his son or bull falls into a well will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day
6  and they were not able to reply to this
7  he then told the invited men an illustration when he noticed how they were choosing the most prominent places for themselves
he said to them
8  when you are invited by someone to a marriage feast do not recline in the most prominent place
perhaps someone more distinguished than you may also have been invited
9  then the one who invited you both will come and say to you let this man have your place
then you will proceed with shame to take the lowest place
10  but when you are invited go and recline in the lowest place so that when the man who invited you comes he will say to you friend go on up higher
then you will have honor in front of all your fellow guests
11  for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted
12  next he said also to the man who had invited him when you spread a dinner or an evening meal do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors
otherwise they might also invite you in return and it would become a repayment to you
13  but when you spread a feast invite the poor the crippled the lame the blind
14  and you will be happy because they have nothing with which to repay you
for you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous ones
15  on hearing these things one of the fellow guests said to him happy is the one who dines in the kingdom of god
16  jesus said to him a man was spreading a grand evening meal and he invited many
17  he sent his slave out at the hour of the evening meal to say to the invited ones come because everything is now ready
18  but they all alike began to make excuses
the first said to him i bought a field and need to go out and see it i ask you have me excused
19  and another said i bought five yoke of cattle and am going to examine them i ask you have me excused
20  still another said i just got married and for this reason i cannot come
21  so the slave came and reported these things to his master
then the master of the house became angry and said to his slave go out quickly to the main streets and the alleys of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame
22  in time the slave said master what you ordered has been done and still there is room
23  so the master said to the slave go out to the roads and the lanes and compel them to come in so that my house may be filled
24  for i say to you none of those men who were invited will taste my evening meal
25  now large crowds were traveling with him and he turned and said to them
26  if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yes and even his own life he cannot be my disciple
27  whoever does not carry his torture stake and come after me cannot be my disciple
28  for example who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it
29  otherwise he might lay its foundation but not be able to finish it and all the onlookers would start to ridicule him
30  saying this man started to build but was not able to finish
31  or what king marching out against another king in war does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with 10000 troops to stand up to the one who comes against him with 20000
32  if in fact he cannot do so then while that one is yet far away he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace
33  in the same way you may be sure that not one of you who does not say goodbye to all his belongings can be my disciple
34  salt to be sure is fine
but if the salt loses its strength with what will it be seasoned
35  it is not suitable for soil or for manure
people throw it away
let the one who has ears to listen listen
19  he then entered jerʹicho and was passing through
2  now a man named zacchaeʹus was there he was a chief tax collector and he was rich
3  well he was trying to see who this jesus was but he could not see because of the crowd since he was short
4  so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see him for he was about to pass that way
5  now when jesus got to the place he looked up and said to him zacchaeʹus hurry and get down for today i must stay in your house
6  with that he hurried down and joyfully welcomed him as a guest
7  when they saw this they were all muttering he went as a guest to the house of a man who is a sinner
8  but zacchaeʹus stood up and said to the lord look the half of my belongings lord i am giving to the poor and whatever i extorted from anyone i am restoring four times over
9  at this jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of abraham
10  for the son of man came to seek and to save what was lost
11  while they were listening to these things he told another illustration because he was near jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of god was going to appear instantly
12  so he said a man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return
13  calling ten of his slaves he gave them ten miʹnas and told them do business with these until i come
14  but his citizens hated him and sent out a body of ambassadors after him to say we do not want this man to become king over us
15  when he eventually got back after having secured the kingly power he summoned the slaves to whom he had given the money in order to ascertain what they had gained by their business activity
16  so the first one came forward and said lord your miʹna gained ten miʹnas
17  he said to him well done good slave because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful hold authority over ten cities
18  now the second came saying your miʹna lord made five miʹnas
19  he said to this one as well you too be in charge of five cities
20  but another one came saying lord here is your miʹna that i kept hidden away in a cloth
21  you see i was in fear of you because you are a harsh man you take what you did not deposit and you reap what you did not sow
22  he said to him by your own words i judge you wicked slave
you knew did you that i am a harsh man taking what i did not deposit and reaping what i did not sow
23  so why did you not put my money in a bank then on my coming i would have collected it with interest
24  with that he said to those standing by take the miʹna from him and give it to the one who has the ten miʹnas
25  but they said to him lord he has ten miʹnas
26  i say to you to everyone who has more will be given but from the one who does not have even what he has will be taken away
27  moreover bring these enemies of mine here who did not want me to become king over them and execute them in front of me
28  after he had said these things he went on ahead going up to jerusalem
29  and when he got near to bethʹphage and bethʹany at the mountain called mount of olives he sent two of the disciples
30  saying go into the village that is within sight and after you enter it you will find a colt tied on which no man has ever sat
untie it and bring it here
31  but if anyone asks you why are you untying it you must say the lord needs it
32  so those who were sent went away and found it just as he had said to them
33  but as they were untying the colt its owners said to them why are you untying the colt
34  they said the lord needs it
35  and they led it to jesus and they threw their outer garments on the colt and seated jesus on it
36  as he moved along they were spreading their outer garments on the road
37  as soon as he got near the road down the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise god with a loud voice because of all the powerful works they had seen
38  saying blessed is the one coming as the king in jehovahs name peace in heaven and glory in the heights above
39  however some of the pharisees from the crowd said to him teacher rebuke your disciples
40  but in reply he said i tell you if these remained silent the stones would cry out
41  and when he got nearby he viewed the city and wept over it
42  saying if you even you had discerned on this day the things having to do with peacebut now they have been hidden from your eyes
43  because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed stakes and will encircle you and besiege you from every side
44  they will dash you and your children within you to the ground and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you because you did not discern the time of your being inspected
45  then he entered the temple and started to throw out those who were selling
46  saying to them it is written my house will be a house of prayer but you have made it a cave of robbers
47  he continued teaching daily in the temple
but the chief priests and the scribes and the principal ones of the people were seeking to kill him
48  but they did not find any way to do this for the people one and all kept hanging on to him to hear him
24  but on the first day of the week they came very early to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared
2  but they found the stone rolled away from the tomb
3  and when they entered they did not find the body of the lord jesus
4  while they were perplexed about this look two men in shining garments stood by them
5  the women became frightened and kept their faces turned toward the ground so the men said to them why are you looking for the living one among the dead
6  he is not here but has been raised up
recall how he spoke to you while he was yet in galʹilee
7  saying that the son of man must be handed over to sinful men and be executed on the stake and on the third day rise
8  then they remembered his words
9  and they returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest
10  they were mary magʹdalene joanʹna and mary the mother of james
also the rest of the women with them were telling these things to the apostles
11  however these sayings seemed like nonsense to them and they would not believe the women
12  but peter got up and ran to the tomb and stooping forward he saw only the linen cloths
so he went off wondering to himself what had occurred
13  but look on that very day two of them were traveling to a village named emmaʹus about seven miles from jerusalem
14  and they were conversing with each other about all these things that had happened
15  now as they were conversing and discussing these things jesus himself approached and began walking with them
16  but their eyes were kept from recognizing him
17  he said to them what are these matters that you are debating between yourselves as you walk along and they stood still looking sad
18  in answer the one named cleʹopas said to him are you a stranger dwelling alone in jerusalem and do not know the things that have occurred there during these days
19  he asked them what things they said to him the things concerning jesus the nazareneʹ who proved to be a prophet powerful in deed and word before god and all the people
20  and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death and they nailed him to the stake
21  but we were hoping that this man was the one who was going to deliver israel
yes and besides all these things this is the third day since these things occurred
22  moreover some women from among us also astonished us for they went early to the tomb
23  and when they did not find his body they came saying that they had also seen a supernatural sight of angels who said he is alive
24  then some of those who were with us went off to the tomb and they found it just as the women had said but they did not see him
25  so he said to them o senseless ones and slow of heart to believe all the things the prophets have spoken
26  was it not necessary for the christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory
27  and starting with moses and all the prophets he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the scriptures
28  finally they got close to the village to which they were traveling and he made as if to travel on farther
29  but they urged him to remain saying stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is nearly over
with that he went in to stay with them
30  and as he was dining with them he took the bread blessed it broke it and began handing it to them
31  at that their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him but he disappeared from them
32  and they said to each other were not our hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on the road as he was fully opening up the scriptures to us
33  and they got up in that very hour and returned to jerusalem and they found the eleven and those assembled together with them
34  who said for a fact the lord was raised up and he appeared to simon
35  then they related the events on the road and how he became known to them by the breaking of the bread
36  while they were speaking of these things he himself stood in their midst and said to them may you have peace
37  but because they were terrified and frightened they imagined that they were seeing a spirit
38  so he said to them why are you troubled and why have doubts come up in your hearts
39  see my hands and my feet that it is i myself touch me and see for a spirit does not have flesh and bones just as you see that i have
40  and as he said this he showed them his hands and his feet
41  but while they were still not believing for sheer joy and amazement he said to them do you have something there to eat
42  so they handed him a piece of broiled fish
43  and he took it and ate it before their eyes
44  he then said to them these are my words that i spoke to you while i was yet with you that all the things written about me in the law of moses and in the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled
45  then he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the scriptures
46  and he said to them this is what is written that the christ would suffer and rise from among the dead on the third day
47  and on the basis of his name repentance for forgiveness of sins would be preached in all the nationsstarting out from jerusalem
48  you are to be witnesses of these things
49  and look i am sending upon you what my father promised
you though stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high
50  then he led them out as far as bethʹany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them
51  as he was blessing them he was parted from them and taken up to heaven
52  and they did obeisance to him and returned to jerusalem with great joy
53  and they were continually in the temple praising god
5  on one occasion when the crowd was pressing in on him and listening to the word of god he was standing by the lake of gennesʹaret
2  and he saw two boats docked at the lakeside but the fishermen had got out of them and were washing off their nets
3  going aboard one of the boats which was simons he asked him to pull away a bit from land
then he sat down and he began teaching the crowds from the boat
4  when he stopped speaking he said to simon pull out to where it is deep and let down your nets for a catch
5  but in reply simon said instructor we toiled all night and caught nothing but at your word i will lower the nets
6  well when they did this they caught a great number of fish
in fact their nets began ripping apart
7  so they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and assist them and they came and filled both boats so that these began to sink
8  seeing this simon peter fell down at the knees of jesus saying depart from me lord because i am a sinful man
9  for both he and those with him were overwhelmed with astonishment at the catch of fish they had taken
10  and the same was true of both james and john zebʹedees sons who were partners with simon
but jesus said to simon stop being afraid
from now on you will be catching men alive
11  so they brought the boats back to land and abandoned everything and followed him
12  on another occasion while he was in one of the cities look there was a man full of leprosy when he caught sight of jesus he fell facedown and begged him lord if you just want to you can make me clean
13  so stretching out his hand he touched him saying i want to be made clean
immediately the leprosy vanished from him
14  then he gave the man orders to tell no one but go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing just as moses directed for a witness to them
15  but the news about him just kept spreading and large crowds would gather together to listen and to be cured of their sicknesses
16  however he often went into the desolate areas to pray
17  on one of those days while he was teaching pharisees and teachers of the law who had come out of every village of galʹilee and judeʹa and from jerusalem were sitting there and jehovahs power was with him to do healing
18  and look men were carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher and they were trying to bring him in and place him before jesus
19  so not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd they climbed up to the roof and they lowered him on the stretcher through the tiling right among those in front of jesus
20  when he saw their faith he said man your sins are forgiven
21  then the scribes and the pharisees started to reason saying who is this who speaks blasphemies who can forgive sins except god alone
22  but jesus discerning their reasoning said in answer to them what are you reasoning in your hearts
23  which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or to say get up and walk
24  but in order for you to know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the paralyzed man i say to you get up pick up your stretcher and go to your home
25  at that he stood up before them picked up what he had been lying on and went to his home glorifying god
26  then one and all were seized with amazement and they began to glorify god and they became filled with awe saying we have seen wonderful things today
27  now after this he went out and saw a tax collector named leʹvi sitting at the tax office and he said to him be my follower
28  and leaving everything behind he rose up and began to follow him
29  then leʹvi spread a big reception feast for him in his house and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were dining with them
30  at this the pharisees and their scribes began murmuring to his disciples saying why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners
31  in reply jesus said to them those who are healthy do not need a physician but those who are ill do
32  i have come to call not righteous people but sinners to repentance
33  they said to him johns disciples fast frequently and offer supplications and so do those of the pharisees but yours eat and drink
34  jesus said to them you cannot make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them can you
35  but days will come when the bridegroom will indeed be taken away from them then they will fast in those days
36  he also gave an illustration to them nobody cuts a patch from a new outer garment and sews it on an old garment
if he does then the new patch tears away and the patch from the new garment does not match the old
37  also no one puts new wine into old wineskins
if he does the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled out and the wineskins will be ruined
38  but new wine must be put into new wineskins
39  no one after drinking old wine wants new for he says the old is nice
15  now all the tax collectors and the sinners kept gathering around him to hear him
2  and both the pharisees and the scribes kept muttering this man welcomes sinners and eats with them
3  then he told them this illustration saying
4  what man among you with 100 sheep on losing one of them will not leave the 99 behind in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it
5  and when he has found it he puts it on his shoulders and rejoices
6  and when he gets home he calls his friends and his neighbors together saying to them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep that was lost
7  i tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who have no need of repentance
8  or what woman who has ten drachma coins if she loses one of the drachmas does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it
9  and when she has found it she calls her friends and neighbors together saying rejoice with me for i have found the drachma coin that i had lost
10  in the same way i tell you joy arises among the angels of god over one sinner who repents
11  then he said a man had two sons
12  and the younger one said to his father father give me the share of the property that should come to me
so he divided his belongings between them
13  a few days later the younger son gathered all his things together and traveled to a distant country and there squandered his property by living a debauched life
14  when he had spent everything a severe famine occurred throughout that country and he fell into need
15  he even went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to herd swine
16  and he longed to be filled with the carob pods that the swine were eating but no one would give him anything
17  when he came to his senses he said how many of my fathers hired men have more than enough bread while i am dying here from hunger
18  i will get up and travel to my father and say to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you
19  i am no longer worthy of being called your son
make me as one of your hired men
20  so he got up and went to his father
while he was still a long way off his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity and he ran and embraced him and tenderly kissed him
21  then the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you
i am no longer worthy of being called your son
22  but the father said to his slaves quick bring out a robe the best one and clothe him with it and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet
23  also bring the fattened calf slaughter it and let us eat and celebrate
24  for this son of mine was dead but has come to life again he was lost and has been found
and they started to enjoy themselves
25  now his older son was in the field and as he returned and got near the house he heard music and dancing
26  so he called one of the servants to him and asked what was happening
27  he said to him your brother has come and your father slaughtered the fattened calf because he got him back in good health
28  but he became angry and refused to go in
then his father came out and began to plead with him
29  in reply he said to his father look these many years i have slaved for you and never once did i disobey your orders and yet you never once gave me a young goat to enjoy with my friends
30  but as soon as this son of yours arrived who squandered your belongings with prostitutes you slaughtered the fattened calf for him
31  then he said to him my son you have always been with me and all the things that are mine are yours
32  but we just had to celebrate and rejoice for your brother was dead but has come to life he was lost and has been found
20  on one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple and declaring the good news the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came
2  and said to him tell us by what authority do you do these things or who gave you this authority
3  he replied to them i will also ask you a question and you tell me
4  was the baptism of john from heaven or from men
5  then they drew conclusions among themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say why did you not believe him
6  but if we say from men the people one and all will stone us for they are convinced that john was a prophet
7  so they replied that they did not know its source
8  jesus said to them neither am i telling you by what authority i do these things
9  then he began to tell the people this illustration a man planted a vineyard and leased it to cultivators and he traveled abroad for a considerable time
10  in due season he sent a slave to the cultivators so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard
the cultivators however sent him away emptyhanded after beating him
11  but again he sent another slave
that one also they beat and humiliated and sent away emptyhanded
12  yet again he sent a third this one also they wounded and threw out
13  at this the owner of the vineyard said what should i do i will send my son the beloved
they will likely respect this one
14  when the cultivators caught sight of him they reasoned with one another saying this is the heir
let us kill him so that the inheritance may become ours
15  so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them
16  he will come and kill these cultivators and will give the vineyard to others
on hearing this they said never may that happen
17  but he looked straight at them and said what then does this mean where it is written the stone that the builders rejected this has become the chief cornerstone
18  everyone falling on that stone will be shattered
as for anyone on whom it falls it will crush him
19  the scribes and the chief priests then sought to get their hands on him in that very hour but they feared the people for they realized that he told this illustration with them in mind
20  and after observing him closely they sent men whom they had secretly hired to pretend that they were righteous in order to catch him in his speech so as to turn him over to the government and to the authority of the governor
21  and they questioned him saying teacher we know you speak and teach correctly and show no partiality but you teach the way of god in line with truth
22  is it lawful for us to pay head tax to caesar or not
23  but he detected their cunning and said to them
24  show me a denarʹius
whose image and inscription does it have they said caesars
25  he said to them by all means then pay back caesars things to caesar but gods things to god
26  well they were not able to trap him in his speech before the people but amazed at his answer they became silent
27  however some of the sadducees those who say there is no resurrection came and asked him
28  teacher moses wrote us if a mans brother dies leaving a wife but he was childless his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother
29  now there were seven brothers
the first took a wife but died childless
30  so the second
31  and the third married her
likewise even all seven they died and left no children
32  finally the woman also died
33  consequently in the resurrection whose wife will she become for the seven had her as a wife
34  jesus said to them the children of this system of things marry and are given in marriage
35  but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
36  in fact neither can they die anymore for they are like the angels and they are gods children by being children of the resurrection
37  but that the dead are raised up even moses made known in the account about the thornbush when he calls jehovah the god of abraham and god of isaac and god of jacob
38  he is a god not of the dead but of the living for they are all living to him
39  in response some of the scribes said teacher you spoke well
40  for they no longer had the courage to ask him a single question
41  in turn he asked them how is it they say that the christ is davids son
42  for david himself says in the book of psalms jehovah said to my lord sit at my right hand
43  until i place your enemies as a stool for your feet
44  david therefore calls him lord so how is he his son
45  then while all the people were listening he said to his disciples
46  beware of the scribes who like to walk around in robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and front seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals
47  and who devour the houses of the widows and for show make long prayers
these will receive a more severe judgment
1  seeing that many have undertaken to compile an account of the facts that are given full credence among us
2  just as these were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and attendants of the message
3  i resolved also because i have traced all things from the start with accuracy to write them to you in logical order most excellent theophʹilus
4  so that you may know fully the certainty of the things that you have been taught orally
5  in the days of herod king of judeʹa there was a priest named zechariʹah of the division of abiʹjah
his wife was from the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth
6  they both were righteous before god walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of jehovah
7  but they had no child because elizabeth was barren and they both were well along in years
8  now as he was serving as priest in the assignment of his division before god
9  according to the established practice of the priesthood it became his turn to offer incense when he entered into the sanctuary of jehovah
10  and the entire multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of offering incense
11  jehovahs angel appeared to him standing at the right side of the incense altar
12  but zechariʹah became troubled at the sight and he was overcome with fear
13  however the angel said to him do not be afraid zechariʹah because your supplication has been favorably heard and your wife elizabeth will bear you a son and you are to name him john
14  you will have joy and great gladness and many will rejoice over his birth
15  for he will be great in the sight of jehovah
but he must drink no wine or any alcoholic drink at all and he will be filled with holy spirit even from before birth
16  and he will turn back many of the sons of israel to jehovah their god
17  also he will go ahead of him with eliʹjahs spirit and power to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones in order to get ready for jehovah a prepared people
18  zechariʹah said to the angel how can i be sure of this for i am old and my wife is well along in years
19  in reply the angel said to him i am gaʹbriel who stands near before god and i was sent to speak with you and to declare this good news to you
20  but look you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their appointed time
21  meanwhile the people continued waiting for zechariʹah and they were surprised that he delayed so long in the sanctuary
22  when he came out he was unable to speak to them and they perceived that he had just seen a supernatural sight in the sanctuary
he kept making signs to them but remained speechless
23  when the days of his holy service were completed he went off to his home
24  some days later elizabeth his wife became pregnant and she kept herself secluded for five months saying
25  this is how jehovah has dealt with me in these days
he has turned his attention to me to take away my reproach among men
26  in her sixth month the angel gaʹbriel was sent from god to a city of galʹilee named nazʹareth
27  to a virgin promised in marriage to a man named joseph of davids house and the name of the virgin was mary
28  and coming in the angel said to her greetings you highly favored one jehovah is with you
29  but she was deeply disturbed at his words and tried to understand what kind of greeting this might be
30  so the angel said to her do not be afraid mary for you have found favor with god
31  and look you will become pregnant and give birth to a son and you are to name him jesus
32  this one will be great and will be called son of the most high and jehovah god will give him the throne of david his father
33  and he will rule as king over the house of jacob forever and there will be no end to his kingdom
34  but mary said to the angel how is this to be since i am not having sexual relations with a man
35  in answer the angel said to her holy spirit will come upon you and power of the most high will overshadow you
and for that reason the one who is born will be called holy gods son
36  and look elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month for her the socalled barren woman
37  for no declaration will be impossible for god
38  then mary said look jehovahs slave girl may it happen to me according to your declaration
at that the angel departed from her
39  so mary set out in those days and traveled with haste into the mountainous country to a city of judah
40  and she entered the home of zechariʹah and greeted elizabeth
41  well as elizabeth heard the greeting of mary the infant in her womb leaped and elizabeth was filled with holy spirit
42  and loudly cried out blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruitage of your womb
43  so how is it that this privilege is mine to have the mother of my lord come to me
44  for look as the sound of your greeting reached my ears the infant in my womb leaped for joy
45  happy too is she who believed for there will be a complete fulfillment of those things spoken to her from jehovah
46  and mary said my soul magnifies jehovah
47  and my spirit cannot keep from being overjoyed at god my savior
48  because he has looked upon the low position of his slave girl
for look from now on all generations will declare me happy
49  because the powerful one has done great deeds for me and holy is his name
50  and for generation after generation his mercy is upon those who fear him
51  he has acted mightily with his arm he has scattered those who are haughty in the intention of their hearts
52  he has brought down powerful men from thrones and has exalted lowly ones
53  he has fully satisfied hungry ones with good things and has sent away emptyhanded those who had wealth
54  he has come to the aid of israel his servant remembering his mercy
55  just as he spoke to our forefathers to abraham and to his offspring forever
56  mary stayed with her about three months and then returned to her own home
57  the time now came for elizabeth to give birth and she gave birth to a son
58  and the neighbors and her relatives heard that jehovah had magnified his mercy to her and they rejoiced with her
59  on the eighth day they came to circumcise the young child and they were going to name him after his father zechariʹah
60  but his mother said in reply no but he will be called john
61  at this they said to her not one of your relatives is called by this name
62  then they asked his father by signs what he wanted him to be called
63  so he asked for a tablet and wrote john is his name
at this they were all amazed
64  instantly his mouth was opened and his tongue was set free and he began to speak praising god
65  and fear fell upon all those living in their neighborhood and all these things began to be talked about in the whole mountainous country of judeʹa
66  and all who heard noted it in their hearts saying what will this young child turn out to be for the hand of jehovah was indeed with him
67  then zechariʹah his father was filled with holy spirit and he prophesied saying
68  let jehovah be praised the god of israel because he has turned his attention to his people and has brought them deliverance
69  and he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of david his servant
70  just as he has spoken through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old
71  of a salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those hating us
72  to show mercy in connection with our forefathers and to call to mind his holy covenant
73  the oath that he swore to abraham our forefather
74  to grant us after we have been rescued from the hands of enemies the privilege of fearlessly rendering sacred service to him
75  with loyalty and righteousness before him all our days
76  but as for you young child you will be called a prophet of the most high for you will go ahead of jehovah to prepare his ways
77  to give knowledge of salvation to his people by forgiveness of their sins
78  because of the tender compassion of our god
with this compassion a daybreak will visit us from on high
79  to give light to those sitting in darkness and deaths shadow and to guide our feet in the way of peace
80  and the young child grew up and became strong in spirit and he continued in the desert until the day he showed himself openly to israel
2  now in those days a decree went out from caesar augusʹtus for all the inhabited earth to be registered
2  this first registration took place when quirinʹius was governor of syria
3  and all the people went to be registered each one to his own city
4  of course joseph also went up from galʹilee from the city of nazʹareth into judeʹa to davids city which is called bethʹlehem because of his being a member of the house and family of david
5  he went to get registered with mary who had been given him in marriage as promised and who was soon to give birth
6  while they were there the time came for her to give birth
7  and she gave birth to her son the firstborn and she wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the lodging place
8  there were also in the same region shepherds living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks
9  suddenly jehovahs angel stood before them and jehovahs glory gleamed around them and they became very fearful
10  but the angel said to them do not be afraid for look i am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have
11  for today there was born to you in davids city a savior who is christ the lord
12  and this is a sign for you you will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger
13  suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising god and saying
14  glory in the heights above to god and on earth peace among men of goodwill
15  so when the angels had departed from them into heaven the shepherds began saying to one another let us by all means go over to bethʹlehem and see what has taken place which jehovah has made known to us
16  and they went quickly and found mary as well as joseph and the infant lying in the manger
17  when they saw this they made known the message that they had been told concerning this young child
18  and all who heard were astonished at what the shepherds told them
19  but mary began to preserve all these sayings drawing conclusions in her heart
20  then the shepherds went back glorifying and praising god for all they had heard and seen just as it had been told to them
21  after eight days when it was time to circumcise him he was named jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived
22  also when the time came for purifying them according to the law of moses they brought him up to jerusalem to present him to jehovah
23  just as it is written in jehovahs law every firstborn male must be called holy to jehovah
24  and they offered a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of jehovah a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
25  and look there was a man in jerusalem named simʹeon and this man was righteous and devout waiting for israels consolation and holy spirit was upon him
26  furthermore it had been divinely revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the christ of jehovah
27  under the power of the spirit he now came into the temple and as the parents brought the young child jesus in to do for him according to the customary practice of the law
28  he took the child into his arms and praised god and said
29  now sovereign lord you are letting your slave go in peace according to your declaration
30  because my eyes have seen your means of salvation
31  that you have prepared in the sight of all the peoples
32  a light for removing the veil from the nations and a glory of your people israel
33  and the childs father and mother continued wondering at the things being spoken about him
34  also simʹeon blessed them and said to mary the childs mother look this child is appointed for the falling and the rising again of many in israel and for a sign to be spoken against
35  yes a long sword will be run through you in order that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed
36  now there was a prophetess anna the daughter of phanʹuel of ashʹers tribe
this woman was well along in years and had lived with her husband for seven years after they were married
37  and she was a widow now 84 years old
she was never missing from the temple rendering sacred service night and day with fasting and supplications
38  in that very hour she came near and began giving thanks to god and speaking about the child to all who were waiting for jerusalems deliverance
39  so when they had carried out all the things according to the law of jehovah they went back into galʹilee to their own city nazʹareth
40  and the young child continued growing and getting strong being filled with wisdom and gods favor continued upon him
41  now his parents were accustomed to go from year to year to jerusalem for the festival of the passover
42  and when he was 12 years old they went up according to the custom of the festival
43  when the days of the festival were over and they were returning the boy jesus remained behind in jerusalem and his parents did not notice it
44  assuming that he was in the group traveling together they went a days journey and then began to search for him among the relatives and acquaintances
45  but not finding him they returned to jerusalem and made a diligent search for him
46  well after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions
47  but all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers
48  now when his parents saw him they were astounded and his mother said to him child why did you treat us this way here your father and i have been frantically looking for you
49  but he said to them why were you looking for me did you not know that i must be in the house of my father
50  however they did not understand what he was saying to them
51  then he went down with them and returned to nazʹareth and he continued subject to them
also his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart
52  and jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with god and men
3  in the 15th year of the reign of tibeʹrius caesar when pontius pilate was governor of judeʹa herod was district ruler of galʹilee philip his brother was district ruler of the country of ituraeʹa and trachoniʹtis and lysaʹnias was district ruler of abileʹne
2  in the days of chief priest anʹnas and of caʹiaphas gods declaration came to john the son of zechariʹah in the wilderness
3  so he went into all the country around the jordan preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins
4  just as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet a voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of jehovah make his roads straight
5  every valley must be filled up and every mountain and hill leveled the crooked ways must become straight and the rough ways smooth
6  and all flesh will see the salvation of god
7  so he began to say to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him you offspring of vipers who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath
8  therefore produce fruits that befit repentance
do not start saying to yourselves we have abraham as our father
for i say to you that god is able to raise up children for abraham from these stones
9  indeed the ax is already lying at the root of the trees
every tree then that does not produce fine fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire
10  and the crowds were asking him what then should we do
11  in reply he said to them let the man who has two garments share with the man who has none and let the one who has something to eat do the same
12  even tax collectors came to be baptized and they said to him teacher what should we do
13  he said to them do not demand anything more than the tax rate
14  also those in military service were asking him what should we do and he said to them do not harass anybody or accuse anybody falsely but be satisfied with your provisions
15  now the people were in expectation and all of them were reasoning in their hearts about john may he perhaps be the christ
16  john gave the answer saying to all i for my part baptize you with water but the one stronger than i am is coming the lace of whose sandals i am not worthy to untie
he will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire
17  his winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out
18  he also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people
19  but herod the district ruler because of being reproved by john concerning heroʹdias the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that herod had done
20  added this also to all those deeds he locked john up in prison
21  now when all the people were baptized jesus too was baptized
as he was praying the heaven was opened up
22  and the holy spirit in bodily form like a dove came down upon him and a voice came out of heaven you are my son the beloved i have approved you
23  when jesus began his work he was about 30 years old being the son as the opinion wasof josephson of heʹli
24  son of matʹthatson of leʹvison of melʹchison of janʹnaison of joseph
25  son of mattathiʹasson of aʹmosson of naʹhumson of esʹlison of nagʹgai
26  son of maʹathson of mattathiʹasson of semʹeinson of joʹsechson of joʹda
27  son of joanʹanson of rheʹsason of zerubʹbabelson of shealʹtielson of neʹri
28  son of melʹchison of adʹdison of coʹsamson of elmaʹdamson of er
29  son of jesusson of elieʹzerson of joʹrimson of matʹthatson of leʹvi
30  son of symʹeonson of judasson of josephson of joʹnamson of eliʹakim
31  son of meʹleason of menʹnason of matʹtathason of nathanson of david
32  son of jesʹseson of oʹbedson of boʹazson of salʹmonson of nahʹshon
33  son of amminʹadabson of arʹnison of hezʹronson of peʹrezson of judah
34  son of jacobson of isaacson of abrahamson of teʹrahson of naʹhor
35  son of seʹrugson of reʹuson of peʹlegson of eʹberson of sheʹlah
36  son of caiʹnanson of arpachʹshadson of shemson of noahson of laʹmech
37  son of methuʹselahson of eʹnochson of jaʹredson of mahaʹlaleelson of caiʹnan
38  son of eʹnoshson of sethson of adamson of god
12  in the meantime when a crowd of so many thousands had gathered together that they were stepping on one another he started by saying first to his disciples watch out for the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy
2  but there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed and nothing secret that will not become known
3  therefore whatever you say in the darkness will be heard in the light and what you whisper in private rooms will be preached from the housetops
4  moreover i say to you my friends do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more
5  but i will show you whom to fear fear the one who after killing has authority to throw into gehenʹna
yes i tell you fear this one
6  five sparrows sell for two coins of small value do they not yet not one of them is forgotten by god
7  but even the hairs of your head are all numbered
have no fear you are worth more than many sparrows
8  i say to you everyone who acknowledges me before men the son of man will also acknowledge him before the angels of god
9  but whoever disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of god
10  and everyone who says a word against the son of man it will be forgiven him but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven
11  when they bring you in before public assemblies government officials and authorities do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in defense or what you will say
12  for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you should say
13  then someone in the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me
14  he said to him man who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two
15  then he said to them keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses
16  with that he told them an illustration saying the land of a rich man produced well
17  so he began reasoning within himself what should i do now that i have nowhere to gather my crops
18  then he said i will do this i will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones and there i will gather all my grain and all my goods
19  and i will say to myself you have many good things stored up for many years take it easy eat drink enjoy yourself
20  but god said to him unreasonable one this night they are demanding your life from you
who then is to have the things you stored up
21  so it goes with the man who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward god
22  then he said to his disciples that is why i say to you stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or about your bodies as to what you will wear
23  for the life is worth more than food and the body more than clothing
24  consider the ravens they neither sow seed nor reap they have neither barn nor storehouse yet god feeds them
are you not worth much more than birds
25  who of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his life span
26  if therefore you cannot do such a small thing why be anxious about the remaining things
27  consider how the lilies grow they neither toil nor spin but i tell you that not even solʹomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these
28  now if this is how god clothes the vegetation in the field that today exists and tomorrow is cast into an oven how much more will he clothe you you with little faith
29  so stop seeking what you will eat and what you will drink and stop being in anxious suspense
30  for all these are the things the nations of the world are eagerly pursuing but your father knows you need these things
31  instead keep seeking his kingdom and these things will be added to you
32  have no fear little flock for your father has approved of giving you the kingdom
33  sell your belongings and give gifts of mercy
make money pouches that do not wear out a neverfailing treasure in the heavens where no thief gets near and no moth consumes
34  for where your treasure is there your hearts will be also
35  be dressed and ready and have your lamps burning
36  and you should be like men waiting for their master to return from the marriage so when he comes and knocks they may at once open to him
37  happy are those slaves whom the master on coming finds watching truly i say to you he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come alongside and minister to them
38  and if he comes in the second watch even if in the third and finds them ready happy are they
39  but know this if the householder had known at what hour the thief would come he would not have let his house be broken into
40  you also keep ready because at an hour that you do not think likely the son of man is coming
41  then peter said lord are you telling this illustration just to us or also to everyone
42  and the lord said who really is the faithful steward the discreet one whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time
43  happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so
44  i tell you truthfully he will appoint him over all his belongings
45  but if ever that slave should say in his heart my master delays coming and starts to beat the male and female servants and to eat and drink and get drunk
46  the master of that slave will come on a day that he is not expecting him and at an hour that he does not know and he will punish him with the greatest severity and assign him a part with the unfaithful ones
47  then that slave who understood the will of his master but did not get ready or do what he asked will be beaten with many strokes
48  but the one who did not understand and yet did things deserving of strokes will be beaten with few
indeed everyone to whom much was given much will be demanded of him and the one who was put in charge of much will have more than usual demanded of him
49  i came to start a fire on the earth and what more is there for me to wish if it has already been lit
50  indeed i have a baptism with which to be baptized and how i am distressed until it is finished
51  do you think i came to give peace on the earth no i tell you but rather division
52  for from now on there will be five in one house divided three against two and two against three
53  they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother motherinlaw against daughterinlaw and daughterinlaw against motherinlaw
54  then he also said to the crowds when you see a cloud rising in the west at once you say a storm is coming and it happens
55  and when you see that a south wind is blowing you say there will be a heat wave and it occurs
56  hypocrites you know how to examine the appearance of earth and sky but why do you not know how to examine this particular time
57  why do you not judge also for yourselves what is righteous
58  for example when you are going with your legal opponent to a ruler while on the way get to work to settle the dispute with him so that he may not summon you before the judge and the judge deliver you to the court officer and the court officer throw you into prison
59  i tell you you will certainly not get out of there until you pay over your last small coin
