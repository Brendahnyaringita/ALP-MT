10  as i was watching i saw above the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubs something like a sapphire stone appearing above them and its appearance resembled a throne
2  then he said to the man clothed in linen enter between the wheelwork under the cherubs and fill both your hands with burning coals from between the cherubs and toss them over the city
so he entered as i watched
3  the cherubs were standing to the right of the house when the man entered and the cloud filled the inner courtyard
4  and the glory of jehovah rose up from the cherubs to the threshold of the doorway of the house and the house gradually became filled with the cloud and the courtyard was full of the brightness of the glory of jehovah
5  and the sound of the wings of the cherubs could be heard in the outer courtyard like the sound of god almighty when he speaks
6  then he commanded the man clothed in linen take fire from between the wheelwork from between the cherubs and he entered and stood beside the wheel
7  then one of the cherubs stretched his hand out toward the fire that was between the cherubs
he took some and put it into both hands of the one clothed in linen who now took it and went out
8  the cherubs had what looked like the form of human hands under their wings
9  as i was watching i saw four wheels beside the cherubs one wheel beside each cherub and the wheels appeared to glow like chrysʹolite stone
10  as for their appearance the four of them were alike looking as though a wheel were within a wheel
11  when they moved they could go in any of the four directions without turning because they would go to the place where the head would face without turning
12  their entire bodies their backs their hands their wings and the wheels the wheels of all four of them were full of eyes all around
13  as regards the wheels i heard a voice that called to them wheelwork
14  each one had four faces
the first face was the face of the cherub the second face was the face of a man the third was the face of a lion and the fourth was the face of an eagle
15  and the cherubs would risethey were the same living creatures that i had seen at the river cheʹbar
16  and when the cherubs moved the wheels would move alongside them and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to be high above the earth the wheels would not turn or move from their side
17  when these stood still they would stand still and when these rose they would rise with them for the spirit operating on the living creatures was in them
18  then the glory of jehovah departed from over the threshold of the doorway of the house and stood still over the cherubs
19  the cherubs now lifted up their wings and rose from the earth as i watched
the wheels were also alongside them when they departed
they stopped at the entrance of the eastern gate of the house of jehovah and the glory of the god of israel was above them
20  these were the living creatures that i had seen under the god of israel at the river cheʹbar so i came to know that they were cherubs
21  all four had four faces four wings and what appeared to be human hands under their wings
22  and the appearances of their faces were like the faces i had seen by the river cheʹbar
they would each go straight forward
4  and you son of man take a brick and put it in front of you
engrave on it a cityjerusalem
2  lay siege to it build a siege wall against it raise up a siege rampart against it set up camps against it and surround it with battering rams
3  take an iron griddle and place it as an iron wall between you and the city
then set your face against it and it will be under siege you are to besiege it
this is a sign to the house of israel
4  then you should lie on your left side and lay the guilt of the house of israel on yourself
you will carry their guilt for the number of days that you lie on your side
5  and i will impose on you 390 days corresponding to the years of their guilt and you will carry the guilt of the house of israel
6  and you must complete them
then for a second time you will lie down on your right side and you will carry the guilt of the house of judah for 40 days
a day for a year a day for a year is what i have given you
7  and you will turn your face toward the siege of jerusalem with your arm bared and you must prophesy against it
8  look i will tie you with ropes so that you cannot turn from your one side to your other side until you have completed the days of your siege
9  and you should take wheat barley broad beans lentils millet and spelt and put them in one container and make them into bread for yourself
for the number of the days that you are lying on your side 390 days you will eat it
10  you will weigh out and eat 20 shekels of food per day
you will eat it at set times
11  and you will drink water by measure a sixth of a hin
you will drink it at set times
12  you will eat it as you would a round barley loaf you will bake it before their eyes using dried human excrement as fuel
13  jehovah went on to say this is how the israelites will eat their breaduncleanamong the nations where i will disperse them
14  i then said not that sovereign lord jehovah from my youth until now i have not been defiled by eating meat from an animal found dead or a torn animal and no unclean meat has entered my mouth
15  so he said to me all right i will allow you to use cattle manure instead of human excrement and you will bake your bread over it
16  he then said to me son of man here i am cutting off your food supply in jerusalem and with great anxiety they will eat their bread ration by weight and in horror they will drink their water ration by measure
17  this will happen so that lacking bread and water they may look in shock at one another and waste away because of their error
26  in the 11th year on the first day of the month the word of jehovah came to me saying
2  son of man because tyre has said against jerusalem aha the gateway of the peoples has been broken everything will come my way and i will become rich now that she is devastated
3  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am against you o tyre and i will bring up many nations against you just as the sea brings up its waves
4  they will destroy the walls of tyre and tear down her towers and i will scrape away soil and make her a shining bare rock
5  she will become a drying yard for dragnets in the midst of the sea
for i myself have spoken declares the sovereign lord jehovah and she will become plunder for the nations
6  and her settlements in the countryside will be slaughtered by the sword and people will have to know that i am jehovah
7  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am bringing king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon against tyre from the north he is a king of kings with horses war chariots cavalrymen and an army of many soldiers
8  he will destroy your settlements in the countryside with the sword and he will build a siege wall and throw up a siege rampart against you and raise up a great shield against you
9  he will pound your walls with his battering ram and with his axes he will pull down your towers
10  his horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust and the sound of the cavalry the wheels and the chariots will cause your walls to shake when he enters your gates like men storming a city with broken walls
11  the hooves of his horses will trample down all your streets he will kill your people with the sword and your mighty pillars will crash to the ground
12  they will loot your resources plunder your merchandise tear down your walls and pull down your fine houses then they will throw your stones and your woodwork and your soil into the water
13  i will put an end to the noise of your songs and the sound of your harps will be heard no more
14  and i will make you a shining bare rock and you will become a drying yard for dragnets
you will never be rebuilt for i myself jehovah have spoken declares the sovereign lord jehovah
15  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says to tyre at the sound of your downfall when the dying ones are groaning when a slaughter takes place in your midst will the islands not shudder
16  all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones and remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments and they will be seized with trembling
they will sit on the ground and tremble constantly and stare at you in amazement
17  and they will sing a dirge over you and say to you how you have perished you who were inhabited from the seas the praised cityyou and your inhabitants were mighty on the seaspreading terror to all the inhabitants of the earth
18  the islands will tremble on the day of your downfallthe islands of the sea will be disturbed when you are gone
19  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says when i devastate you like the cities that are not inhabited when i overwhelm you with the surging waters and the mighty waters have covered you
20  i will bring you and those going down into the pit with you to the people of long ago i will cause you to dwell in the lowest place like the places of old that have been devastated together with those going down into the pit so that you may not be inhabited
then i will glorify the land of the living
21  i will bring sudden terror upon you and you will no longer be
they will search for you but you will never again be found declares the sovereign lord jehovah
11  and a spirit lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the house of jehovah the gate that faces east
there at the entrance of the gate i saw 25 men and among them were jaazaniʹah the son of azʹzur and pelatiʹah the son of benaiʹah princes of the people
2  then he said to me son of man these are the men who are scheming evil and giving wicked advice in this city
3  they are saying is it not the time for building houses the city is the cooking pot and we are the flesh
4  so prophesy against them
prophesy son of man
5  then the spirit of jehovah came upon me and he said to me say this is what jehovah says what you have said is correct o house of israel and i know what you are thinking
6  you have caused many to die in this city and you have filled her streets with the dead
7  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says the dead bodies that you have strewn about the city are the flesh and the city is the cooking pot
but you yourselves will be taken out of it
8  a sword you have feared and a sword i will bring against you declares the sovereign lord jehovah
9  i will bring you out of her and give you into the hand of foreigners and execute judgment on you
10  you will fall by the sword
i will judge you at the border of israel and you will have to know that i am jehovah
11  the city will not be a cooking pot for you and you will not be the flesh within it i will judge you at the border of israel
12  and you will have to know that i am jehovah
for you did not walk in my regulations and carry out my judgments but you have acted in harmony with the judgments of the nations around you
13  as soon as i prophesied pelatiʹah the son of benaiʹah died and i fell facedown and cried with a loud voice alas o sovereign lord jehovah are you going to exterminate the remaining ones of israel
14  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
15  son of man your brothers those of your brothers with the right of repurchase along with the entire house of israel have been told by the inhabitants of jerusalem keep far away from jehovah
the land is ours it has been given to us as a possession
16  therefore say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says although i have removed them far away among the nations and i have scattered them among the lands for a little while i will become a sanctuary for them in the lands to which they have gone
17  therefore say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will also collect you from the peoples and gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel
18  and they will return there and remove from it all its disgusting things and detestable practices
19  and i will give them a unified heart and i will put a new spirit in them and i will remove the heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh
20  in order that they may walk in my statutes and observe my judgments and obey them
then they will be my people and i will be their god
21  but as for those whose hearts are set to continue in their disgusting things and their detestable practices i will bring the consequences of their way upon their head declares the sovereign lord jehovah
22  the cherubs now lifted up their wings and the wheels were close to them and the glory of the god of israel was above them
23  then the glory of jehovah ascended from the city and stopped over the mountain to the east of the city
24  a spirit then lifted me upthrough a vision by the spirit of godand brought me to the exiled people in chaldeʹa
then the vision that i had seen left me
25  and i began to tell the exiled people all the things that jehovah had shown me
8  and in the sixth year in the sixth month on the fifth day of the month when i was sitting in my house and the elders of judah were sitting before me the hand of the sovereign lord jehovah took hold of me there
2  as i watched i saw a form similar to the appearance of fire there was fire below what appeared to be his waist and from his waist upward his appearance was bright like the glow of electrum
3  then he stretched out what appeared to be a hand and took me by a tuft of hair of my head and a spirit carried me between the earth and the heavens and brought me to jerusalem by means of the visions from god to the entrance of the inner gate that faces north where the idolatrous symbol of jealousy that incites jealousy stood
4  and look the glory of the god of israel was there like the appearance that i had seen in the valley plain
5  he then said to me son of man please raise your eyes toward the north
so i raised my eyes toward the north and there north of the gate of the altar was this symbol of jealousy in the entryway
6  and he said to me son of man do you see what terrible detestable things the house of israel is doing here things that make me go far away from my sanctuary but you will see detestable things that are even more terrible
7  then he brought me to the entrance of the courtyard and when i looked i saw a hole in the wall
8  he said to me son of man please bore through the wall
so i bored through the wall and i saw an entryway
9  he said to me go in and see the evil detestable things that they are doing here
10  so i went in and looked and i saw all sorts of images of creeping things and loathsome beasts and all the disgusting idols of the house of israel they were carved on the wall all around
11  and 70 of the elders of the house of israel were standing before them with jaazaniʹah the son of shaʹphan standing among them
each one had his censer in his hand and the perfumed cloud of incense was ascending
12  he said to me son of man do you see what the elders of the house of israel are doing in the darkness each one in the inner rooms where his idols are displayed for they are saying jehovah is not seeing us
jehovah has left the land
13  and he went on to say to me you will see detestable things that are even more terrible that they are doing
14  so he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of jehovah and there i saw women sitting and weeping over the god tamʹmuz
15  and he further said to me do you see this o son of man you will see detestable things that are even more terrible than these
16  so he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of jehovah
there at the entrance of the temple of jehovah between the porch and the altar were about 25 men with their backs to the temple of jehovah and their faces to the east they were bowing down to the sun in the east
17  he said to me son of man do you see this is it a trivial thing for the house of judah to do these detestable things to fill the land with violence and keep offending me here they are thrusting out the branch to my nose
18  so i will act in rage
my eye will not feel sorry nor will i feel compassion
even though they cry out loudly in my ears i will not hear them
30  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man prophesy and say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says wail alas the day is coming
3  for the day is near yes a day of jehovah is near
it will be a day of clouds an appointed time of nations
4  a sword will come against egypt and panic will overtake ethioʹpia when the slain fall in egyptits wealth is taken and its foundations are torn down
5  ethioʹpia put lud and all the mixed populationsand chub along with the sons of the land of the covenantby the sword they will all fall
6  this is what jehovah says the supporters of egypt will also falland its arrogant power will be brought down
from migʹdol to syeʹne they will fall by the sword in the land declares the sovereign lord jehovah
7  they will be made the most desolate of lands and its own cities will become the most devastated cities
8  and they will have to know that i am jehovah when i set a fire in egypt and all its allies are crushed
9  in that day i will send messengers in ships to make selfconfident ethioʹpia tremble panic will seize them in the day that is coming upon egypt for it will surely come
10  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will bring an end to egypts hordes by the hand of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon
11  he and his troops the most ruthless of the nations will be brought in to destroy the land
they will draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain
12  i will turn the canals of the nile into dry ground and will sell the land into the hand of wicked men
i will make the land and everything in it desolate by the hand of foreigners
i myself jehovah have spoken
13  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will also destroy the disgusting idols and bring an end to the worthless gods of noph
there will no longer be a prince from the land of egypt and i will put fear in the land of egypt
14  i will desolate pathʹros and set a fire in zoʹan and execute judgment on no
15  i will pour out my rage on sin the stronghold of egypt and destroy the population of no
16  i will set a fire in egypt and sin will be seized with terror and no will be broken through and noph will face attack in broad daylight
17  the young men of on and pibeʹseth will fall by the sword and the cities will go into captivity
18  in tehaphʹnehes the day will grow dark when i break the yoke bars of egypt there
her arrogant power will come to an end clouds will cover her and her towns will go into captivity
19  i will execute judgment on egypt and they will have to know that i am jehovah
20  and in the 11th year in the first month on the seventh day of the month the word of jehovah came to me saying
21  son of man i have broken the arm of pharʹaoh king of egypt it will not be bound up to be healed or wrapped with a bandage to make it strong enough to take up the sword
22  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am against pharʹaoh king of egypt and i will break his arms the strong one and the broken one and i will make the sword fall from his hand
23  then i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands
24  i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword into his hand and i will break the arms of pharʹaoh and he will groan loudly like a dying man before him
25  i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon but the arms of pharʹaoh will fall limp and they will have to know that i am jehovah when i put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and he wields it against the land of egypt
26  and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands and they will have to know that i am jehovah
16  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man make known to jerusalem her detestable practices
3  you must say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says to jerusalem your origin and your birth were in the land of the caʹnaanite
your father was an amʹorite and your mother was a hitʹtite
4  as for your birth on the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut you were not washed in water to make you clean you were not rubbed with salt and you were not wrapped in cloths
5  no one pitied you enough to do any of these things
no one had compassion for you
instead you were thrown into the open field because you were hated on the day you were born
6  when i was passing by i saw you kicking about in your own blood and as you lay there in your blood i said keep living yes i said to you lying there in your blood keep living
7  i made you a very great multitude like plants sprouting in the field and you grew up and developed and wore the finest ornaments
your breasts became firm and your hair grew but you were still naked and exposed
8  when i was passing by and saw you i noticed that you were old enough for expressions of love
so i spread my garment over you and covered your nakedness and made an oath and entered into a covenant with you declares the sovereign lord jehovah and you became mine
9  furthermore i washed you with water and rinsed away your blood and put oil on you
10  i then clothed you with an embroidered garment and gave you fine leather sandals and wrapped you in fine linen and i clothed you with costly garments
11  i adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck
12  i also put a ring in your nose and earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head
13  you kept adorning yourself with gold and silver and your clothing was fine linen costly material and an embroidered garment
fine flour honey and oil were what you ate and you grew to be extremely beautiful and you became fit to be a queen
14  your fame began to spread among the nations because of your beauty for it was perfect because my own splendor i placed upon you declares the sovereign lord jehovah
15  but you began to trust in your beauty and you became a prostitute because of your fame
you lavished your acts of prostitution on everyone passing by and your beauty became his
16  you took some of your garments and made colorful high places where you prostituted yourselfsuch things should not take place nor should they ever happen
17  you also took your beautiful jewelry made from the gold and silver that i had given to you and you made for yourself male images and prostituted yourself with them
18  and you took your embroidered garments and covered them and you offered them my oil and my incense
19  and the bread that i had given to youmade from fine flour oil and honey that i gave you to eatyou also offered to them as a pleasing aroma
that is exactly what happened declares the sovereign lord jehovah
20  you took your sons and your daughters whom you had borne to me and you sacrificed these to idols to be devouredhave your acts of prostitution not gone far enough
21  you slaughtered my sons and you offered them as sacrifices by making them pass through the fire
22  while engaging in all your detestable practices and acts of prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth when you were naked and exposed kicking about in your own blood
23  after all your evil woe woe to you declares the sovereign lord jehovah
24  you built yourself a mound and made a high place for yourself in every public square
25  you built your high places at the most prominent place of every street and you turned your beauty into something detestable by offering yourself to everyone passing by and you multiplied your acts of prostitution
26  you prostituted yourself to the sons of egypt your lustful neighbors and you offended me with your countless acts of prostitution
27  now i will bring my hand against you and diminish your food allowance and give you over to the will of the women who hate you the daughters of the philisʹtines who were appalled because of your obscene conduct
28  because you could not be satisfied you then prostituted yourself to the sons of assyrʹia but after prostituting yourself to them you still did not find satisfaction
29  so you increased your prostitution toward the land of traders and toward the chaldeʹans but even then you did not find satisfaction
30  how sick your heart was declares the sovereign lord jehovah when you did all these things behaving like a brazen prostitute
31  but when you built your mound at the most prominent place of every street and made your high place in every public square you were not like a prostitute because you refused any payment
32  you are an adulterous wife who takes strangers instead of her own husband
33  people give all prostitutes a gift but you are the one who has given gifts to all those lusting after you and you bribe them to come to you from all around to commit prostitution
34  you are the opposite of other women who engage in prostitution
no one commits prostitution your way you pay others and they do not pay you
your way is the opposite
35  therefore o prostitute hear the word of jehovah
36  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because your lust has been poured out and your nakedness has been exposed during your prostitution with your lovers and all your detestable disgusting idols to which you even sacrificed the blood of your sons
37  therefore i am collecting together all the lovers you have given pleasure to all those you loved together with all those you hated
i will collect them together against you from all around and expose your nakedness to them and they will see you completely naked
38  and i will punish you with the judgments that adulteresses and women shedding blood deserve and your blood will be shed in rage and jealousy
39  i will give you into their hand and they will tear down your mounds and your high places will be pulled down and they will strip you of your garments and take your beautiful jewelry and leave you naked and exposed
40  they will bring against you a crowd and they will stone you and will slaughter you with their swords
41  they will burn your houses with fire and execute judgment on you before the eyes of many women and i will bring an end to your prostitution and you will stop giving payment
42  i will satisfy my rage against you and my indignation will turn away from you and i will be calm and no longer feel offended
43  because you did not remember the days of your youth and you have angered me by doing all these things i will now bring the consequences of your ways on your own head declares the sovereign lord jehovah and you will no longer carry on your obscene conduct and all your detestable practices
44  look everyone who uses proverbs will apply this proverb to you like mother like daughter
45  you are the daughter of your mother who despised her husband and her children
and you are the sister of your sisters who despised their husbands and their children
your mother was a hitʹtite and your father was an amʹorite
46  your older sister is samarʹia who is dwelling to the north of you with her daughters and your younger sister who is dwelling to the south of you is sodʹom with her daughters
47  not only did you walk in their ways and follow their detestable practices but in a short while you were even more corrupt in all your conduct than they were
48  as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah sodʹom your sister and her daughters have not done what you and your daughters have done
49  look this was the error of sodʹom your sister she and her daughters were proud and had an abundance of food and carefree tranquillity yet they did not support the afflicted and the poor
50  they remained haughty and carried on detestable practices in my sight so i found it necessary to remove them
51  nor did samarʹia commit even half as many sins as you did
you kept making your detestable practices abound more than they have to the point that your sisters appeared righteous because of all your detestable practices
52  you must now bear your humiliation because you have justified the behavior of your sisters
on account of your sin of acting more detestably than they have they are more righteous than you
so now be ashamed and bear the humiliation of making your sisters appear righteous
53  and i will gather their captives the captives of sodʹom and her daughters and the captives of samarʹia and her daughters i will also gather your captives along with them
54  so that you may bear your humiliation and you will feel humiliated because of what you have done by comforting them
55  your own sisters sodʹom and her daughters will return to their former state and samarʹia and her daughters will return to their former state and you along with your own daughters will return to your former state
56  sodʹom your sister was not worthy of your mention in the day of your pride
57  before your own wickedness was exposed
now the daughters of syria and her neighbors reproach you and the daughters of the philisʹtines those all around you treat you with scorn
58  you will bear the consequences of your obscene conduct and your detestable practices declares jehovah
59  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will now do with you just as you have done for you despised the oath by breaking my covenant
60  but i myself will remember the covenant that i made with you in the days of your youth and i will establish with you a permanent covenant
61  you will remember your behavior and feel humiliated when you welcome your sisters those older than you as well as those younger than you and i will give them to you as daughters but not because of your covenant
62  and i myself will establish my covenant with you and you will have to know that i am jehovah
63  then you will remember and be too ashamed to open your mouth because of your humiliation when i make an atonement for you despite all that you have done declares the sovereign lord jehovah
35  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man turn your face toward the mountainous region of seʹir and prophesy against it
3  say to it this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am against you o mountainous region of seʹir and i will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate wasteland
4  i will turn your cities into ruins and you will become a desolate wasteland and you will have to know that i am jehovah
5  for you showed unrelenting hostility and you gave the israelites over to the sword at the time of their disaster at the time of their final punishment
6  therefore as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah i will prepare you for bloodshed and bloodshed will pursue you
since it was blood that you hated bloodshed will pursue you
7  i will make the mountainous region of seʹir a desolate wasteland and i will cut off from it anyone passing through and anyone returning
8  i will fill its mountains with the slain and those slain by the sword will fall on your hills in your valleys and in all your streams
9  i will make you a perpetual desolation and your cities will not be inhabited and you will have to know that i am jehovah
10  because you said these two nations and these two lands will become mine and we will take possession of both even though jehovah himself was there
11  therefore as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah i will deal with you according to the same anger and jealousy that you displayed in your hatred toward them and i will make myself known among them when i judge you
12  you will then have to know that i myself jehovah have heard all the insolent things you spoke against the mountains of israel when you said they have been laid desolate and have been given to us to devour
13  and you spoke arrogantly against me and you multiplied your words against me
i heard it all
14  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says the whole earth will rejoice when i will make you a desolate wasteland
15  just as you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of israel was laid desolate that is how i will deal with you
you will become a desolate ruin o mountainous region of seʹir yes all of eʹdom and they will have to know that i am jehovah
18  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  what does this proverb that you quote in the land of israel mean fathers have eaten sour grapes but the teeth of the sons are set on edge
3  as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah you will not continue to quote this saying in israel
4  look all the soulsto me they belong
as the soul of the father so also the soul of the sonto me they belong
the soul who sins is the one who will die
5  suppose that a man is righteous and does what is just and right
6  he does not eat idolatrous sacrifices on the mountains he does not look up to the disgusting idols of the house of israel he does not defile his neighbors wife or have relations with a woman who is menstruating
7  he does not mistreat anyone but he returns what a debtor has given him in pledge he does not rob anyone but he gives his own food to the hungry one and covers the naked one with a garment
8  he does not charge interest or engage in usury but he refrains from acting with injustice he executes true justice between one man and another
9  and he keeps walking in my statutes and observing my judicial decisions in order to act in faithfulness
such a man is righteous and will surely keep living declares the sovereign lord jehovah
10  but suppose that he has become father to a son who is a robber or a murderer or who does any of these other things
11  though the father has not done any of these thingshe eats idolatrous sacrifices on the mountains defiles his neighbors wife
12  mistreats the needy and the poor takes things by robbery does not return a pledge looks up to the disgusting idols engages in detestable practices
13  engages in usury and charges interestthen the son will not keep living
because of all these detestable things that he has done he will surely be put to death
his own blood will be upon him
14  but suppose that a father has a son who sees all the sins his father has committed and though he sees them he does not do such things
15  he does not eat idolatrous sacrifices on the mountains he does not look up to the disgusting idols of the house of israel he does not defile his neighbors wife
16  he does not mistreat anyone he does not seize what was pledged he does not take anything in robbery he gives his own food to the hungry one and covers the naked one with a garment
17  he refrains from oppressing the poor he does not engage in usury or charge interest and he carries out my judicial decisions and walks in my statutes
such a man will not die because of the error of his father
he will surely keep living
18  but because his father practiced fraud robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people he will die for his error
19  but you will say why does the son not bear guilt because of his fathers error since the son has done what is just and righteous has kept all my statutes and has observed them he will surely keep living
20  the soul who sins is the one who will die
a son will bear no guilt because of the error of his father and a father will bear no guilt because of the error of his son
the righteousness of the righteous one will be accounted to him alone and the wickedness of the wicked one will be accounted to him alone
21  now if someone wicked turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps my statutes and does what is just and righteous he will surely keep living
he will not die
22  none of the transgressions that he has committed will be held against him
he will keep living for doing what is righteous
23  do i take any pleasure at all in the death of a wicked person declares the sovereign lord jehovah
do i not prefer that he turn away from his ways and keep living
24  but when someone righteous abandons his righteousness and does what is wrong doing all the detestable things the wicked do will he live none of the righteous acts that he did will be remembered
for his unfaithfulness and the sin he has committed he will die
25  but you will say the way of jehovah is unjust
please listen o house of israel is it my way that is unjust is it not your ways that are unjust
26  when someone righteous abandons his righteousness and does what is wrong and dies because of it he will die for his own wrongdoing
27  and when someone wicked turns away from the wickedness that he has committed and begins to do what is just and righteous he will preserve his own life
28  when he realizes and turns away from all the transgressions that he has committed he will surely keep living
he will not die
29  but the house of israel will say the way of jehovah is unjust
is it really my ways that are unjust o house of israel is it not your ways that are unjust
30  therefore i will judge each one of you according to his ways o house of israel declares the sovereign lord jehovah
turn away yes turn completely away from all your transgressions so that they will not be a stumbling block bringing guilt upon you
31  rid yourselves of all the transgressions you have committed and acquire a new heart and a new spirit for why should you die o house of israel
32  i do not take any pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord jehovah
so turn back and live
17  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man tell a riddle and relate a proverb about the house of israel
3  you must say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says the great eagle with great wings long pinions and full colorful plumage came to lebʹanon and took the top of the cedar
4  he plucked off its topmost shoot and brought it to the land of traders and set it down in a city of traders
5  he then took some of the seed of the land and put it in a fertile field
he planted it like a willow by abundant waters
6  so it sprouted and became a low sprawling vine with its foliage facing inward and its roots growing under it
thus it became a vine and produced shoots and sent out branches
7  and there came another great eagle with great wings and large pinions
this vine then stretched its roots eagerly toward him away from the garden beds where it was planted and it sent out its foliage toward him so that he would irrigate it
8  it had already been planted in a good field near abundant waters in order to produce branches to bear fruit and to become a majestic vine
9  say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says will it prosper will someone not tear out its roots and make its fruit rot and cause its sprouts to wither it will become so dry that neither a strong arm nor many people will be needed to pull it up by the roots
10  although it is transplanted will it prosper will it not dry up completely when the east wind blows on it it will dry up in the garden bed where it sprouted
11  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
12  please tell the rebellious house do you not realize what these things mean say look the king of babylon came to jerusalem and took its king and its princes and brought them back with him to babylon
13  furthermore he took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him and put him under an oath
then he took away the prominent men of the land
14  so that the kingdom would be brought low unable to rise up so that only by keeping his covenant might it continue to exist
15  but the king finally rebelled against him by sending his messengers to egypt to obtain horses and a large army from them
will he succeed will the one doing these things escape punishment can he break the covenant and still escape
16  as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah he will die in babylon in the place where the king who made him king lives the one whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke
17  and the great army and numerous troops of pharʹaoh will be of no help in the war when siege ramparts are raised and siege walls are built to destroy many lives
18  he has despised an oath and broken a covenant
even though he gave his promise he has done all these things and he will not escape
19  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says as surely as i am alive i will bring upon his head the consequences of despising my oath and breaking my covenant
20  i will cast my net over him and he will be caught in my hunting net
i will bring him to babylon and enter into judgment with him there because of the unfaithfulness he committed against me
21  all the fugitives of his troops will fall by the sword and those remaining will be scattered in every direction
then you will have to know that i myself jehovah have spoken
22  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will take a shoot from the top of the lofty cedar and plant it from the top of its twigs i will pluck a tender shoot and i myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain
23  on a high mountain of israel i will plant it and its branches will grow and it will produce fruit and become a majestic cedar
and every kind of bird will live beneath it and reside in the shadow of its foliage
24  and all the trees of the field will have to know that i myself jehovah have brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree i have dried up the green tree and made the dry tree blossom
i myself jehovah have spoken and have done it
9  he then called out in my ears with a loud voice saying summon those who will bring punishment on the city each one with his weapon for destruction in his hand
2  i saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate that faces north each with his weapon for smashing in his hand and there was one man among them clothed in linen with a secretarys inkhorn at his waist and they came in and stood beside the copper altar
3  then the glory of the god of israel rose from where it had rested above the cherubs and moved to the threshold of the doorway of the house and he began calling out to the man who was clothed in linen at whose waist was the secretarys inkhorn
4  jehovah said to him go through the city through jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the city
5  and to the others he said in my hearing go through the city after him and strike
do not let your eye feel sorry and do not feel any compassion
6  old man young man virgin little child and women you should kill off completely
but do not go near to any man on whom there is the mark
you should start from my sanctuary
so they started with the elders who were in front of the house
7  then he said to them defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain
go so they went out and struck down people in the city
8  while they were striking them down i alone was left and i fell facedown and cried out alas o sovereign lord jehovah are you going to destroy all the remaining ones of israel while you pour out your rage on jerusalem
9  so he said to me the error of the house of israel and judah is very very great
the land is filled with bloodshed and the city is full of corruption
for they say jehovah has left the land and jehovah is not seeing
10  but as for me my eye will not feel sorry nor will i show compassion
the consequences of their way i will bring down on their own head
11  then i saw the man clothed in linen with the inkhorn at his waist bringing back word saying i have done just as you have commanded me
28  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man tell the leader of tyre this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because your heart has become haughty you keep saying i am a god
i sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the sea
but you are only a man not a godthough in your heart you feel that you are a god
3  look you are wiser than daniel
no secrets have been hidden from you
4  you have made yourself wealthy by your wisdom and your discernmentand you keep storing up gold and silver in your treasuries
5  your skillful trading brought you great wealthand your heart grew haughty because of your wealth
6  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because in your heart you feel that you are a god
7  i am bringing foreigners against you the most ruthless of the nationsand they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdomand defile your glorious splendor
8  they will bring you down to the pitand you will die a violent death in the heart of the open sea
9  will you still say i am a god to the one killing you you will be a mere man not a god in the hand of those defiling you
10  by the hand of foreigners you will die the death of the uncircumcised onesfor i myself have spoken declares the sovereign lord jehovah
11  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
12  son of man sing a dirge concerning the king of tyre and tell him this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says you were the model of perfectionfull of wisdom and perfect in beauty
13  you were in eʹden the garden of god
you were adorned with every precious stoneruby topaz and jasper chrysʹolite onyx and jade sapphire turquoise and emeraldand their settings and mountings were made of gold
they were prepared on the day you were created
14  i assigned you as the anointed covering cherub
you were on the holy mountain of god and you walked about among fiery stones
15  you were faultless in your ways from the day you were createduntil unrighteousness was found in you
16  because of your abundant tradeyou became filled with violence and you began to sin
so i will cast you out as profane from the mountain of god and destroy youo covering cherub away from the stones of fire
17  your heart became haughty because of your beauty
you corrupted your wisdom because of your own glorious splendor
i will throw you down to the earth
i will make you a spectacle before kings
18  because of your great guilt and your dishonest trading you have profaned your sanctuaries
i will cause a fire to break out in your midst and it will consume you
i will reduce you to ashes on the earth before all those looking at you
19  all who knew you among the peoples will stare at you in amazement
your end will be sudden and terribleand you will cease to exist for all time
20  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
21  son of man turn your face toward siʹdon and prophesy against her
22  you should say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am against you o siʹdon and i will be glorified in your midstand people will have to know that i am jehovah when i execute judgment on her and i am sanctified in her
23  i will send pestilence into her and blood will flow in her streets
the slain will fall in her midst when the sword comes against her from all sidesand they will have to know that i am jehovah
24  then the house of israel will no longer be surrounded by injurious briars and painful thorns those who treat them with scorn and people will have to know that i am the sovereign lord jehovah
25  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says when i regather the house of israel from among the peoples where they were scattered i will be sanctified among them in the eyes of the nations
and they will dwell on their land that i gave to my servant jacob
26  they will dwell on it in security and build houses and plant vineyards and they will dwell in security when i execute judgment on all those around them who treat them with scorn and they will have to know that i am jehovah their god
27  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  as for you son of man sing a dirge over tyre
3  and say to tyreyou who dwell at the gateways of the seathe merchant for the peoples of many islandsthis is what the sovereign lord jehovah says o tyre you yourself have said i am perfect in beauty
4  your territories are in the heart of the seaand your builders have perfected your beauty
5  they made all your planks from the juniper trees of seʹnirand they took a cedar from lebʹanon to make a mast for you
6  they made your oars from oaks of baʹshanand your prow was of cypress inlaid with ivory from the islands of kitʹtim
7  colorful linen from egypt served as cloth for your sailand your deck awnings were of blue thread and purple wool from the islands of eliʹshah
8  the inhabitants of siʹdon and of arʹvad were your rowers
your own skilled men o tyre were your sailors
9  the experienced and skilled men of geʹbal caulked your seams
all the ships of the sea and their mariners came to you to trade merchandise
10  men of persia lud and put were in your army your men of war
they hung their shields and helmets in you and they brought you splendor
11  the men of arʹvad in your army were stationed on your walls all aroundand brave men manned your towers

23  haʹran canʹneh eʹden the merchants of sheʹba asʹshur and chilʹmad traded with you
24  in your marketplace they traded beautiful garments cloaks made of blue material and colorful embroidery and multicolored carpets all bound and secured with ropes
25  the ships of tarʹshish were the caravans for your merchandiseso that you were filled and loaded down in the heart of the open sea
26  your rowers have brought you into heavy seasthe east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the open sea
27  your wealth your goods your merchandise your mariners and your sailorsthose caulking your seams those trading your merchandise and all the men of warthe entire multitude within youthey will all sink in the heart of the open sea on the day of your downfall

30  they will raise their voices and cry out bitterly over youas they throw dust on their heads and wallow in ashes
31  they will make themselves bald and put on sackcloththey will weep bitterly over you with intense wailing
32  in their lamentation they will sing a dirge and chant over you who is like tyre now silent in the midst of the sea
33  when your goods came in from the open sea you satisfied many peoples
your abundant wealth and your merchandise enriched earths kings
34  now you have been wrecked in the open sea in the deep watersand all your merchandise and your people have sunk with you
35  all the inhabitants of the islands will stare at you in amazementand their kings will shudder with horrortheir faces will be troubled
36  the merchants among the nations will whistle over what happened to you
your end will be sudden and terribleand you will cease to exist for all time
7  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  as for you son of man this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says to the land of israel an end the end has come upon the four corners of the land
3  the end is now upon you and i will unleash my anger against you and i will judge you according to your ways and call you to account for all your detestable deeds
4  my eye will not feel sorry for you nor will i feel compassion for i will bring upon you the results of your own ways and you will suffer the consequences of your detestable deeds
and you will have to know that i am jehovah
5  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says look a calamity a unique calamity is coming
6  an end is coming the end will come it will rouse itself against you
look it is coming
7  your turn has come you who inhabit the land
the time is coming the day is near
there is confusion and not joyful shouting on the mountains
8  very soon i will pour out my rage on you and i will fully unleash my anger against you and i will judge you according to your ways and call you to account for all your detestable deeds
9  my eye will not feel sorry nor will i feel compassion
i will bring on you the results of your ways and you will suffer the consequences of your own detestable deeds
and you will have to know that i jehovah am striking you
10  look the day look it is coming your turn has come the rod has blossomed and presumptuousness has sprouted
11  violence has grown into a rod of wickedness
neither they nor their wealth nor their crowds nor their prominence will survive
12  the time will come the day will arrive
let the buyer not rejoice and let the seller not mourn for there is wrath against their whole crowd
13  for the seller will not return to what was sold even if his life is spared for the vision is against the entire multitude
no one will return and because of his error no one will preserve his life
14  they have blown the trumpet and everyone is ready but no one is going to the battle because my wrath is against the whole multitude
15  the sword is outside and the pestilence and the famine are inside
whoever is in the field will die by the sword and famine and pestilence will consume those in the city
16  their survivors who manage to escape will go to the mountains and like the doves of the valleys each one will moan over his error
17  all their hands will hang limp and all their knees will drip with water
18  they have put on sackcloth and shuddering has seized them
everyone will be put to shame and every head will be bald
19  they will throw their silver into the streets and their gold will become abhorrent to them
neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the day of jehovahs fury
they will not be satisfied nor will they fill their stomachs for it has become a stumbling block causing their error
20  they took pride in the beauty of their ornaments and they made with them their detestable images their disgusting idols
that is why i will make it an abhorrent thing to them
21  i will give it into the hand of the foreigners for plunder and to the wicked ones of the earth for spoil and they will profane it
22  i will turn my face away from them and they will profane my concealed place and robbers will enter it and profane it
23  make the chain for the land is full of bloodstained judgment and the city is full of violence
24  i will bring in the worst of the nations and they will take possession of their houses and i will put an end to the pride of the strong ones and their sanctuaries will be profaned
25  when their anguish comes they will seek peace but there will be none
26  there will come disaster upon disaster and one report after another and people will seek a vision from a prophet but the law will perish from a priest and advice from the elders
27  the king will go into mourning and the chieftain will be clothed with despair and the hands of the people of the land will tremble in terror
i will treat them according to their ways and i will judge them as they have judged
and they will have to know that i am jehovah
34  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel
prophesy and say to the shepherds this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says woe to the shepherds of israel who have been feeding themselves is it not the flock that the shepherds should feed
3  you eat the fat you clothe yourselves with the wool and you slaughter the fattest animal but you do not feed the flock
4  you have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bandaged the injured or brought back the strays or looked for the lost rather you have ruled them with harshness and tyranny
5  so they were scattered because there was no shepherd they were scattered and became food for every wild beast of the field
6  my sheep were straying on all the mountains and on every high hill my sheep were scattered over all the surface of the earth with no one searching for them or seeking to find them
7  therefore you shepherds hear the word of jehovah
8  as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah because my sheep have become prey food for every wild beast of the field for there was no shepherd and my shepherds did not search for my sheep rather they kept feeding themselves and did not feed my sheep
9  therefore you shepherds hear the word of jehovah
10  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i am against the shepherds and i will demand an accounting of them for my sheep and i will dismiss them from feeding my sheep and the shepherds will no longer feed themselves
i will rescue my sheep from their mouth and they will no longer be food for them
11  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am and i myself will search for my sheep and i will care for them
12  i will care for my sheep like a shepherd who has found his scattered sheep and is feeding them
i will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered in the day of clouds and thick gloom
13  i will bring them out from the peoples and collect them together from the lands and bring them into their land and feed them on the mountains of israel by the streams and by all the dwelling places of the land
14  in a good pasture i will feed them and the land where they graze will be on israels high mountains
they will lie down there in a good grazing land and they will feed on choice pastures on the mountains of israel
15  i myself will feed my sheep and i myself will make them lie down declares the sovereign lord jehovah
16  the lost one i will search for the stray i will bring back the injured i will bandage and the weak i will strengthen but the fat one and the strong one i will annihilate
i will feed that one with judgment
17  as for you my sheep this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i am about to judge between one sheep and another sheep between the rams and the male goats
18  is it not enough for you to feed on the very best pastures must you also trample the rest of your pastures with your feet and after drinking the clearest water must you foul the water by stamping with your feet
19  should my sheep now feed on the pasture trampled by your feet and drink the water befouled by the stamping of your feet
20  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says to them here i am and i myself will judge between a fat sheep and a lean sheep
21  for with your flank and shoulder you kept pushing and with your horns you kept shoving all the sick ones until you had scattered them abroad
22  and i will save my sheep and they will no longer become something to prey upon and i will judge between a sheep and a sheep
23  i will raise up one shepherd over them my servant david and he will feed them
he himself will feed them and become their shepherd
24  and i jehovah will become their god and my servant david a chieftain among them
i myself jehovah have spoken
25  and i will make a covenant of peace with them and i will rid the land of vicious wild beasts so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forests
26  i will make them and the area around my hill a blessing and i will cause the rain to fall at the proper time
blessings will pour down like the rains
27  the trees of the field will yield their fruit and the soil will give its produce and they will dwell securely on the land
and they will have to know that i am jehovah when i break their yoke bars and rescue them from those who enslaved them
28  they will no longer become something for the nations to prey upon and the wild beasts of the earth will not devour them and they will dwell in security with no one to make them afraid
29  i will establish for them a plantation of fame and they will no longer die from famine in the land and they will no longer be humiliated by the nations
30  then they will have to know that i jehovah their god am with them and that they the house of israel are my people declares the sovereign lord jehovah
31  as for you my sheep the sheep that i care for you are but men and i am your god declares the sovereign lord jehovah
46  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says the gate of the inner courtyard that is facing east should remain shut for the six workdays but on the sabbath day and on the day of the new moon it should be opened
2  the chieftain will enter from outside by way of the porch of the gate and he will stand by the doorpost of the gate
the priests will offer his whole burnt offering and his communion sacrifices and he will bow down at the threshold of the gate and then go out
but the gate should not be shut until the evening
3  the people of the land will also bow down before jehovah at the entrance of that gate on the sabbaths and on the new moons
4  the whole burnt offering that the chieftain will present to jehovah on the sabbath day should consist of six sound male lambs and a sound ram
5  the grain offering will be an eʹphah for the ram and whatever he is able to give for the male lambs along with a hin of oil with each eʹphah
6  on the day of the new moon the offering will consist of a sound young bull of the herd six male lambs and a ram they should be sound ones
7  he should offer as a grain offering an eʹphah for the young bull an eʹphah for the ram and whatever he can afford for the male lambs
and he should offer a hin of oil with each eʹphah
8  when the chieftain enters he should enter by way of the porch of the gate and he should go out the same way
9  and when the people of the land come in before jehovah during the festivals those who come in to worship through the north gate should go out through the south gate and those who come in through the south gate should go out through the north gate
no one should go back by way of the gate through which he entered for they should exit through the gate that is opposite them
10  as for the chieftain who is among them he should come in when they come in and he should go out when they go out
11  during the festivals and the festal seasons the grain offering should be an eʹphah for the young bull an eʹphah for the ram and whatever he is able to give for the male lambs along with a hin of oil with each eʹphah
12  if the chieftain provides a whole burnt offering or communion sacrifices as a voluntary offering to jehovah the gate facing east will be opened for him and he will provide his whole burnt offering and his communion sacrifices just as he does on the sabbath day
after he goes out the gate should be shut behind him
13  each day you should provide a sound male lamb in its first year as a whole burnt offering to jehovah
you should do this morning by morning
14  along with it each morning you should provide a sixth of an eʹphah as a grain offering along with a third of a hin of oil for sprinkling on the fine flour as a regular grain offering to jehovah
this is a lasting statute
15  they must provide the male lamb the grain offering and the oil each morning as a regular whole burnt offering
16  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says if the chieftain gives a gift to each one of his sons as an inheritance it will become the property of his sons
it is their possession by inheritance
17  but if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants it will be his until the year of liberty and then it will return to the chieftain
only the inheritance of his sons will be permanently theirs
18  the chieftain should not take any of the inheritance of the people by forcing them off their property
he should give his sons an inheritance from his own property so that no one among my people may be driven from his property
19  then he brought me in by the entryway that was beside the gate leading to the holy dining rooms of the priests which faced north and there i saw a place at the rear toward the west
20  he said to me this is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they will bake the grain offering so that they will not carry anything out to the outer courtyard and transmit holiness to the people
21  he brought me out to the outer courtyard and led me past the four corners of the courtyard and i saw a courtyard by each corner of the outer courtyard
22  at the four corners of the courtyard were small courtyards 40 cubits long and 30 cubits wide
all four of them were the same size
23  there were ledges all around the four of them and beneath the ledges were built places to boil the offerings
24  then he said to me these are the houses where the ministers of the temple boil the sacrifice of the people
37  the hand of jehovah was upon me and by his spirit jehovah took me and set me down in the middle of the valley plain and it was full of bones
2  he had me pass all around them and i saw that there were very many bones lying in the valley plain and they were very dry
3  he asked me son of man can these bones come to life to that i said sovereign lord jehovah you are the one who knows
4  so he said to me prophesy over these bones and say to them you dry bones hear the word of jehovah
5  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says to these bones i will cause breath to enter you and you will come to life
6  i will put sinews and flesh on you and i will cover you with skin and put breath in you and you will come to life and you will have to know that i am jehovah
7  then i prophesied just as i had been commanded
as soon as i prophesied there was a noise a rattling sound and the bones began to come together bone to bone
8  then i saw sinews and flesh come on them and skin covered over them
but there was still no breath in them
9  he then said to me prophesy to the wind
prophesy son of man and say to the wind this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says from the four winds come in o wind and blow upon these people who were killed so that they may come to life
10  so i prophesied just as he commanded me and breath came into them and they began to live and to stand on their feet an extremely large army
11  then he said to me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel
here they are saying our bones are dry and our hope has perished
we are completely cut off
12  so prophesy and say to them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will open your graves and raise you up from your graves my people and bring you to the land of israel
13  and you will have to know that i am jehovah when i open your graves and when i raise you up out of your graves o my people
14  i will put my spirit in you and you will come to life and i will settle you on your land and you will have to know that i myself jehovah have spoken and i have done it declares jehovah
15  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
16  and you son of man take a stick and write on it for judah and for the people of israel who are with him
then take another stick and write on it for joseph the stick of eʹphraim and all the house of israel who are with him
17  then bring them close to each other so that they become just one stick in your hand
18  when your people say to you will you not tell us what these things mean
19  tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will take the stick of joseph which is in the hand of eʹphraim and the tribes of israel who are with him and i will join them to the stick of judah and i will make them one stick and they will become one in my hand
20  the sticks that you write on should be in your hand for them to see
21  then tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will take the israelites from among the nations where they have gone and i will collect them together from every direction and bring them to their land
22  i will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of israel and one king will rule over all of them and they will no longer be two nations nor will they be divided any longer into two kingdoms
23  they will no longer defile themselves with their disgusting idols and their detestable practices and all their transgressions
i will save them from all their unfaithfulness by which they have sinned and i will cleanse them
they will be my people and i myself will be their god
24  my servant david will be their king and they will all have one shepherd
they will walk in my judicial decisions and carefully observe my statutes
25  they will dwell on the land that i gave to my servant to jacob where your forefathers lived and they will dwell on it forever they and their children and their childrens children and david my servant will be their chieftain forever
26  and i will make a covenant of peace with them it will be an eternal covenant with them
i will establish them and make them many and place my sanctuary among them forever
27  my tent will be with them and i will be their god and they will be my people
28  and the nations will have to know that i jehovah am sanctifying israel when my sanctuary is in their midst forever
45  when you allot the land as an inheritance you should offer as a contribution to jehovah a holy portion out of the land
its length should be 25000 cubits and its width 10000 cubits
its entire area will be a holy portion
2  within this will be a square lot for the holy place measuring 500 cubits by 500 cubits and it will have 50 cubits as pastures on each side
3  out of this measurement you should measure the length of 25000 and the width of 10000 and within it will be the sanctuary something most holy
4  it will be a holy portion of the land for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary who approach to minister to jehovah
it will be a place for their houses and a sacred place for the sanctuary
5  for the levites the ministers of the temple there will be a portion 25000 cubits long and 10000 cubits wide and they will have 20 dining rooms as a possession
6  you should give the possession of the city an area that is 25000 cubits long corresponding to the holy contribution and 5000 cubits wide
it will belong to all the house of israel
7  and for the chieftain there will be land on both sides of the holy contribution and of the area allotted to the city
it will be next to the holy contribution and the possession of the city
it will be on the west side and on the east side
its length from the western boundary to the eastern boundary will correspond to one of the tribal portions
8  this land will become his possession in israel
my chieftains will no longer mistreat my people and they will give the land to the house of israel according to their tribes
9  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says you have gone far enough chieftains of israel put an end to your violence and oppression and do what is just and righteous
stop seizing the property of my people declares the sovereign lord jehovah
10  you should use accurate scales an accurate eʹphah measure and an accurate bath measure
11  there should be a fixed measurement for the eʹphah measure and the bath measure
the bath measure should hold a tenth of a hoʹmer and the eʹphah measure should hold a tenth of a hoʹmer
the hoʹmer will be the standard for measuring
12  the shekel is to be 20 geʹrahs
and 20 shekels plus 25 shekels plus 15 shekels will make up one maʹneh for you
13  this is the contribution that you should offer one sixth of an eʹphah from each hoʹmer of wheat and one sixth of an eʹphah from each hoʹmer of barley
14  the allowance of the oil is to be based on the bath measure
the bath is a tenth of a cor and ten baths are a hoʹmer for ten baths equal a hoʹmer
15  and from the flock of the livestock of israel one sheep out of every 200 should be given
these will be for the grain offering the whole burnt offering and the communion sacrifices in order to make atonement for the people declares the sovereign lord jehovah
16  all the people of the land will make this contribution to the chieftain in israel
17  but the chieftain will be responsible for the whole burnt offerings the grain offering and the drink offering during the festivals the new moons the sabbaths and all the designated festivals of the house of israel
he will be the one to provide the sin offering the grain offering the whole burnt offering and the communion sacrifices in order to make atonement in behalf of the house of israel
18  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says in the first month on the first day of the month you should take a sound young bull of the herd and you are to purify the sanctuary from sin
19  the priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorpost of the temple on the four corners of the surrounding ledge of the altar and on the doorpost of the gate of the inner courtyard
20  that is what you will do on the seventh day of the month because of anyone who sins by mistake or through ignorance and you are to make atonement for the temple
21  in the first month on the 14th day of the month you will observe the festival of the passover
for seven days unleavened bread should be eaten
22  on that day the chieftain will provide a young bull as a sin offering in his own behalf and in behalf of all the people of the land
23  for the seven days of the festival he will provide as a whole burnt offering to jehovah seven sound young bulls and seven sound rams each of the seven days as well as a male goat each day as a sin offering
24  he should also provide as a grain offering an eʹphah for each young bull and an eʹphah for each ram as well as a hin of oil for each eʹphah
25  in the seventh month on the 15th day of the month for seven days during the festival he should provide the same sin offering whole burnt offering grain offering and oil
23  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man there were two women who were the daughters of the same mother
3  they became prostitutes in egypt from their youth they engaged in prostitution
their breasts were squeezed there and their virgin bosoms were fondled
4  their names were ohoʹlah the older one and her sister oholʹibah
they became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters
as for their names ohoʹlah is samarʹia and oholʹibah is jerusalem
5  ohoʹlah began to prostitute herself while she belonged to me
she lusted after her passionate lovers her neighbors the assyrʹians
6  they were governors clothed in blue and deputy rulersall desirable young men mounted on their horses
7  she continued to prostitute herself with all the choicest sons of assyrʹia and she defiled herself with the disgusting idols of those she lusted after
8  she did not abandon the prostitution she practiced in egypt for in her youth they had lain down with her and they fondled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her
9  so i gave her into the hand of her passionate lovers the sons of assyrʹia after whom she had lusted
10  they exposed her nakedness and seized her sons and daughters and they killed her with a sword
she became notorious among women and they executed judgment against her
11  when her sister oholʹibah saw it her lust became even more depraved and her prostitution was worse than that of her sister
12  she lusted after her neighbors the sons of assyrʹia the governors and deputy rulers who were clothed in splendor and mounted on horsesall desirable young men
13  when she defiled herself i saw that both of them had followed the same course
14  but she kept adding to her acts of prostitution
she saw men carved on the wall images of chaldeʹans carved in vermilion
15  wearing belts around their waist with flowing turbans on their heads having the appearance of warriors all of them depicting babylonians born in the land of the chaldeʹans
16  she began to lust after them as soon as she saw them and she sent messengers to them in chaldeʹa
17  so the sons of babylon kept coming to her bed of lovemaking and they defiled her with their lust
after she was defiled by them she turned away from them in disgust
18  when she went on brazenly engaging in prostitution and exposing her nakedness i turned away from her in disgust just as i had turned away from her sister in disgust
19  and she kept increasing her acts of prostitution calling to mind the days of her youth when she prostituted herself in the land of egypt
20  she lusted after them like the concubines of men whose male members are like those of a donkey and whose genitals are like those of a horse
21  you yearned for the obscene conduct of your youth in egypt when they fondled your bosom the breasts of your youth
22  therefore oholʹibah this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am stirring up your lovers whom you turned away from in disgust and i will bring them against you from every direction
23  the sons of babylon and all the chaldeʹans the men of peʹkod and shoʹa and koʹa along with all the sons of assyrʹia
all of them are desirable young men governors and deputy rulers warriors and handpicked all mounted on horses
24  they will attack you with rumbling war chariots and wheels and with a great assembly of troops with large shield and buckler and helmet
they will take up positions all around you and i will authorize them to pass judgment and they will judge you as they see fit
25  i will express my indignation against you and they will deal with you in their rage
they will cut off your nose and your ears and those of you who remain will fall by the sword
they will take away your sons and your daughters and those of you who remain will be consumed by fire
26  they will strip off your garments and seize your beautiful jewelry
27  i will put an end to your obscene conduct and your prostitution which started in the land of egypt
you will stop looking at them and you will remember egypt no more
28  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am about to hand you over to those you hate those you turned away from in disgust
29  they will deal with you in hatred and take away all you have toiled for and leave you naked and exposed
the shameful nakedness of your immorality and your obscene conduct and your prostitution will be exposed
30  these things will be done to you because you chased after the nations like a prostitute because you defiled yourself with their disgusting idols
31  you have followed the same course as your sister and i will put her cup into your hand
32  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says you will drink the deep and wide cup of your sisterand you will become an object of laughter and ridicule of which the cup contains much
33  you will be overcome by drunkenness and griefa cup of horror and desolationthe cup of your sister samarʹia
34  you will have to drink it and drain it dry and gnaw on its earthenware fragmentsand then tear out your breasts
for i myself have spoken declares the sovereign lord jehovah
35  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because you have forgotten me and have completely disregarded me you will bear the consequences of your obscene conduct and your acts of prostitution
36  jehovah then said to me son of man will you pronounce judgment on ohoʹlah and oholʹibah and confront them with their disgusting practices
37  they have committed adultery and there is blood on their hands
not only have they committed adultery with their disgusting idols but they have also made their sons whom they bore to me pass through the fire as food for their idols
38  moreover this is what they have done to me they defiled my sanctuary on that day and they profaned my sabbaths
39  after they slaughtered their sons as sacrifices to their disgusting idols they came into my sanctuary to profane it on that very day
that is what they did inside my own house
40  they even sent a messenger for men to come from far away
when they were coming you washed yourself and painted your eyes and adorned yourself with ornaments
41  and you sat down on a magnificent couch with a table set in front of it on which you put my incense and my oil
42  the sound of a carefree crowd of men was heard there among whom were drunkards brought in from the wilderness
they put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads
43  then i said regarding her who was worn out with adultery now she will keep committing her prostitution
44  so they kept going in to her just as one goes to a prostitute
that is how they went in to ohoʹlah and to oholʹibah the women of obscene conduct
45  but righteous men will render to her the appropriate judgment for adultery and bloodshed for adulteresses is what they are and they have blood on their hands
46  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says an army will be brought against them to make them an object of horror and something to plunder
47  the army will hurl stones at them and cut them down with their swords
they will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses with fire
48  i will put an end to the obscene conduct in the land and all the women will learn a lesson and not copy your obscene conduct
49  they will bring on you the consequences of your obscene conduct and of your sins with your disgusting idols and you will have to know that i am the sovereign lord jehovah
42  then he led me to the outer courtyard toward the north
and he brought me to the diningroom block that was next to the open area north of the adjoining building
2  its length at the north entrance was 100 cubits and it was 50 cubits wide
3  it was located between the inner courtyard which was 20 cubits wide and the pavement of the outer courtyard
its galleries faced each other and were three stories high
4  before the dining rooms was an inner walkway 10 cubits wide and 100 cubits long and their entrances were to the north
5  the upper dining rooms of the building were narrower than those in the lower and middle stories because the galleries took up more of their space
6  for they were three stories high but they had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards
that is why more floor space was taken away from them than from the lower and middle stories
7  the outer stone wall near the dining rooms toward the outer courtyard that faced the other dining rooms was 50 cubits long
8  for the length of the dining rooms that were toward the outer courtyard was 50 cubits but for those facing the sanctuary it was 100 cubits
9  the dining rooms had an entryway on the east side leading up to them from the outer courtyard
10  there were also dining rooms inside the stone wall of the courtyard toward the east near the open area and the building
11  there was a walkway before them like that of the northern dining rooms
they were the same length and width and they had the same exits and layouts
their entrances
12  were like the entrances of the dining rooms that were toward the south
there was an entrance at the beginning of the walkway before the adjacent stone wall toward the east where one could enter
13  then he said to me the dining rooms of the north and the dining rooms of the south that are next to the open area are the holy dining rooms where the priests who are approaching jehovah eat the most holy offerings
there they place the most holy offerings the grain offering the sin offering and the guilt offering because the place is holy
14  when the priests enter they should not go out of the holy place to the outer courtyard without first removing the garments in which they minister for these are holy
they will clothe themselves with other garments in order to approach the areas permitted to the people
15  when he finished measuring the inner temple area he led me out by way of the gate that faces east and he measured the entire area
16  he measured the eastern side with the measuring reed
according to the measuring reed it was 500 reed lengths from one side to the other
17  he measured the northern side and according to the measuring reed it was 500 reed lengths
18  he measured the southern side and according to the measuring reed it was 500 reed lengths
19  he went around to the western side
he measured 500 reed lengths with the measuring reed
20  he measured it on the four sides
it had a wall all around it that was 500 reeds long and 500 reeds wide to make a division between what is holy and what is for common use
22  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  as for you son of man are you prepared to pronounce judgment on the bloodguilty city and to make known to her all her detestable things
3  you are to say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says o city that sheds blood within herself whose time is coming who makes disgusting idols to defile herself
4  your bloodshed has made you guilty and your disgusting idols have made you unclean
you have hastened the end of your days and the end of your years has come
that is why i will make you an object of reproach to the nations and an object of mockery to all the lands
5  the lands nearby and those far away from you will mock you you whose name is unclean and who are filled with turmoil
6  look each of the chieftains of israel among you uses his authority to shed blood
7  within you they treat their father and mother with contempt
they defraud the foreign resident and they mistreat the fatherless child and the widow
8  my holy places you despise and my sabbaths you profane
9  within you are slanderers intent on shedding blood
within you they eat sacrifices on the mountains and carry on obscene conduct in your midst
10  within you they dishonor their fathers bed and they violate a woman unclean in her menstruation
11  within you one man acts detestably with his neighbors wife another defiles his own daughterinlaw with obscene conduct and another violates his sister the daughter of his own father
12  within you they take a bribe to shed blood
you lend on interest or for a profit and you extort money from your neighbors
yes you have entirely forgotten me declares the sovereign lord jehovah
13  look i clap my hands in disgust at the dishonest gain you have made and over the acts of bloodshed in your midst
14  will your courage endure and your hands remain strong in the days when i take action against you i myself jehovah have spoken and i will take action
15  i will scatter you among the nations and disperse you among the lands and i will put an end to your uncleanness
16  and you will be dishonored before the nations and you will have to know that i am jehovah
17  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
18  son of man the house of israel has become like worthless dross to me
all of them are copper and tin and iron and lead in a furnace
they have become the dross of silver
19  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because all of you have become like worthless dross i am collecting you together inside jerusalem
20  just as silver and copper and iron and lead and tin are collected inside a furnace in order to blow fire upon them and melt them so i will collect you together in my anger and in my rage and i will blow upon you and make you melt
21  i will bring you together and blow upon you with the fire of my fury and you will be melted inside of her
22  just as silver is melted in a furnace so you will be melted inside her and you will have to know that i myself jehovah have poured out my rage on you
23  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
24  son of man say to her you are a land that will not be cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation
25  her prophets have conspired within her like a roaring lion tearing prey
they are devouring people
they are seizing treasure and precious things
they have made many widows within her
26  her priests have violated my law and they keep profaning my holy places
they make no distinction between what is holy and what is common and they fail to make known what is unclean and what is clean and they refuse to observe my sabbaths and i am profaned among them
27  her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing prey they shed blood and kill people to make dishonest gain
28  but her prophets have plastered over their deeds with whitewash
they see false visions and give lying divination and they say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says when jehovah himself has not spoken
29  the people of the land have defrauded and committed robbery they have mistreated the needy and the poor and they have defrauded the foreign resident and denied him justice
30  i was looking for a man from among them who would repair the stone wall or stand before me in the breach in behalf of the land so that it would not be destroyed but i found no one
31  so i will pour out my indignation on them and exterminate them with the fire of my fury
i will bring the consequences of their way on their own head declares the sovereign lord jehovah
38  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man set your face against gog of the land of maʹgog the head chieftain of meʹshech and tuʹbal and prophesy against him
3  say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am against you o gog head chieftain of meʹshech and tuʹbal
4  i will turn you around and put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with all your army horses and horsemen all of them clothed in splendor a vast assembly with large shields and bucklers all of them wielding swords
5  persia ethioʹpia and put are with them all of them with buckler and helmet
6  goʹmer and all its troops the house of togarʹmah from the remotest parts of the north along with all its troopsmany peoples are with you
7  be ready prepare yourselves you with all your armies that are assembled with you and you will be their commander
8  you will be given attention after many days
in the final part of the years you will invade the land whose people have been restored from the ravages of the sword collected together out of many peoples onto the mountains of israel which had long been lying devastated
the inhabitants of this land were restored from the peoples and all of them dwell in security
9  you will come against them like a storm and you will cover the land like clouds you and all your troops and many peoples with you
10  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says in that day thoughts will come into your heart and you will devise an evil plan
11  you will say i will invade the land of unprotected settlements
i will come against those living in security without disturbance all of them living in settlements unprotected by walls bars or gates
12  it will be to take much spoil and plunder to attack the devastated places that are now inhabited and a people regathered from the nations who are accumulating wealth and property those who are living in the center of the earth
13  sheʹba and deʹdan the merchants of tarʹshish and all its warriors will say to you are you invading to get much spoil and plunder have you assembled your armies to carry off silver and gold to take wealth and property to seize a very great spoil
14  so prophesy son of man and say to gog this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says on that day when my people israel are dwelling in security will you not know it
15  you will come from your place from the remotest parts of the north you and many peoples with you all of them riding on horses a great assembly a vast army
16  like clouds covering the land you will come against my people israel
in the final part of the days i will bring you against my land so that the nations may know me when i sanctify myself through you before their eyes o gog
17  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says are you not the same one i spoke about in the former days through my servants the prophets of israel who prophesied for many years that you would be brought against them
18  on that day the day when gog invades the land of israel declares the sovereign lord jehovah my great rage will flare up
19  in my zeal in the fire of my fury i will speak and in that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of israel
20  because of me the fish of the sea the birds of the sky the wild beasts of the field all the reptiles that creep on the ground and all humans on the surface of the earth will tremble and the mountains will be thrown down and the cliffs will fall and every wall will collapse to the ground
21  i will call for a sword against him on all my mountains declares the sovereign lord jehovah
every mans sword will be against his own brother
22  i will bring my judgment against him with pestilence and bloodshed and i will rain down a torrential downpour and hailstones and fire and sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many peoples with him
23  and i will certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the eyes of many nations and they will have to know that i am jehovah
32  and in the 12th year in the 12th month on the first day of the month the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man sing a dirge concerning pharʹaoh king of egypt and say to himyou were like a strong young lion of the nationsbut you have been silenced
you were like a sea monster thrashing about in your riversmuddying the waters with your feet and fouling the rivers
3  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says by means of an assembly of many nations i will cast my net over youand they will haul you up in my dragnet
4  i will abandon you on the landi will cast you onto the open field
i will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on youand i will satisfy the wild beasts of the whole earth with you
5  i will cast your flesh on the mountainsand fill the valleys with your remains
6  i will drench the land with your gushing blood up to the mountainsand it will fill the streams
7  and when you are extinguished i will cover the heavens and darken their stars
i will cover the sun with cloudsand the moon will not give its light
8  i will darken all the shining luminaries in the heavens because of youand i will cover your land with darkness declares the sovereign lord jehovah
9  i will distress the hearts of many peoples when i lead your captives to other nationsto lands that you have not known
10  i will cause many peoples to be awestruckand their kings will shudder in horror over you when i brandish my sword before them
they will tremble continually each fearing for his lifeon the day of your downfall
11  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says the sword of the king of babylon will come upon you
12  i will cause your hordes to fall by the swords of mighty warriorsthe most ruthless of the nations all of them
they will bring down the pride of egypt and all her hordes will be annihilated
13  i will destroy all her livestock beside her abundant watersand no foot of a human or hoof of the livestock will muddy them again
14  at that time i will clear up their watersand i will make their rivers flow like oil declares the sovereign lord jehovah
15  when i make egypt a desolate wasteland a land stripped of all that filled itwhen i strike down all the inhabitants in itthey will have to know that i am jehovah
16  this is a dirge and people will certainly chant itthe daughters of the nations will chant it
they will chant it over egypt and over all its hordes declares the sovereign lord jehovah
17  then in the 12th year on the 15th day of the month the word of jehovah came to me saying
18  son of man wail over the hordes of egypt and bring her down to the land below her and the daughters of mighty nations with those going down into the pit
19  whom do you surpass in beauty go down and lie with the uncircumcised ones
20  they will fall among those slain by the sword
she has been given to the sword drag her away along with all her hordes
21  from the depths of the grave the mightiest warriors will speak to him and his helpers
they will certainly go down and will lie just like the uncircumcised slain by the sword
22  assyrʹia is there with all her assembly
their graves are all around him all of them fallen by the sword
23  her graves are in the depths of the pit and her assembly is all around her grave all of them struck down by the sword because they caused terror in the land of the living
24  eʹlam is there with all her hordes around her grave all of them fallen by the sword
they have gone down uncircumcised to the land below those who caused terror in the land of the living
now they will bear their shame with those going down into the pit
25  they have made a bed for her among the slain along with all her hordes around her graves
all of them are uncircumcised slain by the sword because they caused terror in the land of the living and they will bear their shame with those going down into the pit
he has been put among the slain
26  there is where meʹshech and tuʹbal and all their hordes are
her graves are all around him
all of them are uncircumcised pierced through by the sword because they caused terror in the land of the living
27  will they not lie with mighty uncircumcised warriors who have fallen who went down to the grave with their weapons of war and they will put their swords under their heads and their sins on their bones because these mighty warriors terrorized the land of the living
28  but as for you you will be crushed among the uncircumcised ones and you will lie with those who were slain by the sword
29  eʹdom is there her kings and all her chieftains who despite their mightiness were laid among those slain by the sword they too will lie with the uncircumcised ones and with those going down into the pit
30  there all the princes of the north are along with all the sidoʹnians who have gone down in disgrace with the slain despite the terror caused by their mightiness
they will lie uncircumcised with those who were slain by the sword and will bear their shame with those going down into the pit
31  pharʹaoh will see all of these and he will be comforted over all that happened to his hordes pharʹaoh and all his army will be slain by the sword declares the sovereign lord jehovah
32  because he caused terror in the land of the living pharʹaoh and all his hordes will be laid to rest with the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword declares the sovereign lord jehovah
6  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man turn your face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them
3  you must say o mountains of israel hear the word of the sovereign lord jehovah this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says to the mountains to the hills to the streams and to the valleys look i will bring a sword against you and i will destroy your high places
4  your altars will be demolished your incense stands will be broken and i will throw your slain ones down before your disgusting idols
5  i will throw the carcasses of the people of israel before their disgusting idols and i will scatter your bones all around your altars
6  in all the places where you dwell the cities will be devastated and the high places will be demolished and will lie devastated
your altars will be demolished and shattered your disgusting idols will perish your incense stands will be cut down and your works will be wiped out
7  and those slain will fall in your midst and you will have to know that i am jehovah
8  but i will leave a remnant for some of you will escape the sword among the nations when you are scattered throughout the lands
9  and those who escape will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive
they will realize that i was brokenhearted over their unfaithful heart that turned away from me and at their eyes that are lusting after their disgusting idols
they will be ashamed of and loathe all the evil and detestable things they have done
10  they will have to know that i am jehovah and that my threats to bring this calamity on them were not empty
11  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says clap your hands and stamp your foot and bemoan all the evil and detestable things done by the house of israel for they will fall by the sword by famine and by pestilence
12  the one far away will die by pestilence the one nearby will fall by the sword and whoever escapes these and is left remaining will die by famine and i will fully unleash my wrath against them
13  and you will have to know that i am jehovah when their slain lie among their disgusting idols all around their altars on every high hill on all the mountaintops under every luxuriant tree and under the branches of big trees where they have made fragrant offerings to appease all their disgusting idols
14  i will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate and all their dwelling places will become more desolate than the wilderness near dibʹlah
and they will have to know that i am jehovah
31  in the 11th year in the third month on the first day of the month the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man say to pharʹaoh king of egypt and to his hordeswhom are you like in your greatness
3  there was an assyrʹian a cedar in lebʹanonwith beautiful branches like a shady thicket lofty in statureits top was among the clouds
4  the waters made it grow big the deep springs of water caused it to grow high
streams were all around where it was plantedtheir channels watered all the trees of the field
5  that is why it grew taller than all the other trees of the field
its boughs multiplied and its branches grew longbecause of the abundant water in its streams
6  all the birds of the sky nested in its boughsall the wild animals of the field gave birth under its branchesand all the populous nations were dwelling in its shade
7  it became majestic in beauty and in the length of its branchesfor its roots went down into abundant waters
8  no other cedars in the garden of god could compare to it
none of the juniper trees had boughs like itand none of the plane trees could match its branches
no other tree in the garden of god could rival its beauty
9  i made it beautiful with abundant foliageand all the other trees of eʹden the garden of the true god envied it
10  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because it became so tall lifting its top among the clouds and its heart became arrogant because of its height
11  i will hand it over to the mighty ruler of the nations
he will surely act against it and i will reject it for its wickedness
12  and foreigners the most ruthless of the nations will cut it down and they will abandon it on the mountains and its foliage will fall in all the valleys and its branches will lie broken in all the streams of the land
all the peoples of the earth will depart from its shade and abandon it
13  all the birds of the sky will live on its fallen trunk and all the wild animals of the field on its branches
14  this is so that no tree near the waters should grow so tall or lift up its top among the clouds and that no wellwatered tree may reach up to them in height
for they will all be given over to death to the land down below along with the sons of mankind who are going down into the pit
15  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says on the day it goes down to the grave i will cause a mourning
therefore i will cover over the deep waters and hold back its streams so that the abundant waters are restrained
i will darken lebʹanon because of it and the trees of the field will all wither away
16  at the sound of its downfall i will cause nations to shudder when i bring it down to the grave along with all those going down into the pit and all the trees of eʹden the choicest and the best of lebʹanon all that are wellwatered will be comforted in the land down below
17  they have gone down to the grave with him to those slain by the sword together with his supporters who lived in his shadow among the nations
18  which of the trees of eʹden was like you in glory and greatness but you will certainly be brought down with the trees of eʹden to the land down below
you will lie down among the uncircumcised ones with those slain by the sword
this will happen to pharʹaoh and all his hordes declares the sovereign lord jehovah
21  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man turn your face toward jerusalem and make a proclamation against the holy places and prophesy against the land of israel
3  say to the land of israel this is what jehovah says here i am against you and i will bring my sword out of its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked
4  because i will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked my sword will be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north
5  all people will have to know that i myself jehovah have drawn my sword from its sheath
it will not go back again
6  and you son of man sigh while you tremble yes sigh bitterly before them
7  and if they say to you why are you sighing you will say because of a report
for it will certainly come and every heart will melt with fear and every hand will hang limp and every spirit will become dejected and every knee will drip with water
look it will certainly comeit will take place declares the sovereign lord jehovah
8  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
9  son of man prophesy and say this is what jehovah says say a sword a sword is sharpened and it is polished
10  it is sharpened to inflict a great slaughter it is polished to flash like lightning
should we not rejoice will it reject the scepter of my own son as it does every tree
11  it is given to be polished and to be wielded with the hand
this sword is sharpened and polished to be put into the hand of an executioner
12  cry out and wail son of man for it has come against my people it is against all the chieftains of israel
these will be victims of the sword along with my people
so strike your thigh in grief
13  for an examination has been made and what will happen if the sword rejects the scepter it will cease to exist declares the sovereign lord jehovah
14  and you son of man prophesy and clap your hands and repeat a sword three times
it is the sword of the slain victims the sword of great slaughter that surrounds them
15  their hearts will melt with fear and many will fall at their city gates i will inflict a slaughter by the sword
yes it flashes like lightning and is polished for a slaughter
16  cut sharply to the right swing to the left go wherever your blade is directed
17  i will also clap my hands and satisfy my rage
i myself jehovah have spoken
18  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
19  as for you son of man mark out two ways for the sword of the king of babylon to come
both of them will originate from the same land and a signpost should be set up where the road branches off to the two cities
20  you should mark out one way for the sword to come against rabʹbah of the amʹmonites and the other way against fortified jerusalem in judah
21  for the king of babylon stops to use divination at the fork in the road where the two roads branch off
he shakes the arrows
he consults his idols he examines the liver
22  the divination in his right hand is pointed toward jerusalem to set up battering rams to give the word for slaughter to sound the battle cry to set battering rams against the gates to throw up a siege rampart to build a siege wall
23  but it will seem like false divination in the eyes of those who had sworn oaths to them
but he remembers their guilt and will capture them
24  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says you have caused your own guilt to be remembered by exposing your transgressions and causing your sins to be seen in all your actions
now that you have been remembered you will be taken by force
25  but your day has come o fatally wounded wicked chieftain of israel the time of your final punishment
26  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says remove the turban and take off the crown
this will not remain the same
raise up the low one and bring low the high one
27  a ruin a ruin a ruin i will make it
and it will not belong to anyone until the one who has the legal right comes and i will give it to him
28  and you son of man prophesy and say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says about the amʹmonites and about their insults
say a sword a sword is drawn for a slaughter it is polished to devour and to flash like lightning
29  despite the false visions and lying divination about you you will be piled up on the slain the wicked men whose day has come the time of their final punishment
30  return it to its sheath
i will judge you in the place that you were created in the land of your origin
31  i will pour out my indignation on you
i will blow upon you with the fire of my fury and i will hand you over to brutal men the craftsmen of destruction
32  you will become fuel for the fire your own blood will be shed in the land and you will be remembered no more for i myself jehovah have spoken
25  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man turn your face toward the amʹmonites and prophesy against them
3  you must say concerning the amʹmonites hear the word of the sovereign lord jehovah
this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because you said aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of israel when it was laid desolate and against the house of judah when they went into exile
4  therefore i am giving you to the people of the east as a possession
they will set up their encampments within you and pitch their tents among you
they will eat your fruitage and they will drink your milk
5  i will make rabʹbah a pasture ground for camels and the land of the amʹmonites a restingplace for the flock and you will have to know that i am jehovah
6  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet and you rejoiced over the land of israel with such utter scorn
7  therefore i will stretch out my hand against you to give you to the nations as something to plunder
i will cut you off from the peoples and destroy you from the lands
i will annihilate you and you will have to know that i am jehovah
8  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because moʹab and seʹir have said look the house of judah is like all the other nations
9  i am exposing moʹabs flank at his frontier cities the beauty of his land bethjeshʹimoth baʹalmeʹon and clear to kiriathaʹim
10  i will give it along with the amʹmonites as a possession to the people of the east so that the amʹmonites will not be remembered among the nations
11  and i will execute judgment in moʹab and they will have to know that i am jehovah
12  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says eʹdom has acted vengefully against the house of judah and has incurred great guilt in taking revenge on them
13  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will also stretch out my hand against eʹdom and cut off from it both man and livestock and i will make it desolate
from teʹman clear to deʹdan they will fall by the sword
14  i will take vengeance on eʹdom by the hand of my people israel
they will bring my anger and my wrath on eʹdom so that they experience my own vengeance declares the sovereign lord jehovah
15  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because of their unrelenting hostility the philisʹtines have maliciously sought to bring vengeance and destruction
16  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am stretching out my hand against the philisʹtines and i will cut off the cherʹethites and will destroy the remaining inhabitants of the seacoast
17  i will execute on them great acts of vengeance with furious punishments and they will have to know that i am jehovah when i bring my vengeance on them
13  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel and say to those who fabricate their own prophecies hear the word of jehovah
3  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says woe to the stupid prophets who follow their own spirit when they have seen nothing
4  o israel your prophets have become like foxes among the ruins
5  you will not go to the broken places in the stone walls to rebuild them for the house of israel so that israel may keep standing in the battle in the day of jehovah
6  they have seen false visions and foretold a lie those who are saying the word of jehovah is when jehovah himself has not sent them and they have waited for their word to come true
7  is it not a false vision that you have seen and a lie that you have foretold when you say the word of jehovah is when i have not said anything
8  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because you have spoken what is false and your visions are a lie i am against you declares the sovereign lord jehovah
9  my hand is against the prophets whose visions are false and who foretell a lie
they will not be among the people with whom i confide nor will they be written in the registry of the house of israel nor will they return to the land of israel and you will have to know that i am the sovereign lord jehovah
10  all of this is because they have led my people astray by saying there is peace when there is no peace
when a flimsy partition wall is built they are plastering it with whitewash
11  tell those plastering with whitewash that it will fall
a torrential downpour will come hailstones will fall and powerful windstorms will break it down
12  and when the wall falls you will be asked where is your coating of plaster
13  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will cause powerful windstorms to burst forth in my wrath and a torrential downpour in my anger and hailstones in destructive fury
14  i will tear down the wall that you plastered with whitewash and bring it down to the earth and its foundation will be exposed
when the city falls you will perish within her and you will have to know that i am jehovah
15  when i fully unleash my wrath upon the wall and upon those who plastered it with whitewash i will say to you the wall is no more and those plastering it are no more
16  the prophets of israel are gone those who prophesy to jerusalem and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace declares the sovereign lord jehovah
17  as for you son of man set your face against the daughters of your people who fabricate their own prophecies and prophesy against them
18  tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says woe to the women who sew together bands for all arms and make veils for heads of every size in order to hunt down peoples lives are you hunting for the lives of my people and trying to preserve your own lives
19  will you profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for scraps of bread putting to death those who should not die and keeping alive those who should not live doing so by your lies to my people who listen to your lies
20  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am against your bands o women which you use to hunt down people as though they were birds and i will rip them from your arms and release those whom you are hunting down like birds
21  i will rip away your veils and rescue my people out of your hand and they will no longer be something for you to catch in the hunt and you will have to know that i am jehovah
22  for you have disheartened the righteous one with your falsehood when i was not causing him distress and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked one so that he does not turn back from his bad way and stay alive
23  therefore you women will no longer see false visions and practice divination and i will rescue my people from your hand and you will have to know that i am jehovah
14  and some of the elders of israel came and sat down before me
2  then the word of jehovah came to me saying
3  son of man these men are determined to follow their disgusting idols and they have set up a stumbling block that causes people to sin
should i let them inquire of me
4  now speak with them and tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says if an israelite is determined to follow his disgusting idols and sets up a stumbling block causing people to sin and he then comes to inquire of a prophet i jehovah will answer him appropriately according to his many disgusting idols
5  for i will cause terror in the hearts of the house of israel because they have all withdrawn from me and have gone after their disgusting idols
6  so tell the house of israel this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says come back and turn away from your disgusting idols and turn your faces away from all your detestable practices
7  for if any israelite or foreign resident living in israel separates himself from me and is determined to follow his disgusting idols and sets up a stumbling block that causes people to sin and then comes to inquire of my prophet i jehovah i will personally answer him
8  i will set my face against that man and make him a warning sign and a proverbial saying and i will cut him off from my people and you will have to know that i am jehovah
9  but if the prophet is fooled and gives a response it is i jehovah who have fooled that prophet
i will then stretch out my hand against him and annihilate him from my people israel
10  they will have to bear their guilt the guilt of the inquirer will be the same as the guilt of the prophet
11  so that the house of israel may stop wandering away from me and stop defiling themselves by all their transgressions
and they will be my people and i will be their god declares the sovereign lord jehovah
12  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
13  son of man if a land sins against me by acting unfaithfully i will stretch out my hand against it and destroy its food supply and i will send famine upon it and cut off man and animal from it
14  even if these three mennoah daniel and jobwere within it they would be able to save only themselves because of their righteousness declares the sovereign lord jehovah
15  or suppose i make vicious wild animals pass through the land and they depopulate it and make it a wasteland without anyone passing through because of the wild animals
16  as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah even if these three men were in it they would save neither their sons nor their daughters they would save only themselves and the land would become desolate
17  or suppose i bring a sword against that land and say let a sword pass through the land and cut off from it both man and animal
18  even if these three men were in it as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah they would save neither their sons nor their daughters they would save only themselves
19  or suppose i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my rage on it with bloodshed to cut off from it man and animal
20  even if noah daniel and job were in it as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah they would save neither their sons nor their daughters they would save only themselves because of their righteousness
21  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says so it will be when i send my four punishmentssword famine vicious wild animal and pestilenceagainst jerusalem to cut off man and animal from it
22  however some left in it will escape and be brought out both sons and daughters
they are coming to you and when you see their ways and their deeds you will certainly be comforted over the calamity that i brought on jerusalem over everything that i did to it
23  they will comfort you when you see their ways and their deeds and you will know that it was not without cause that i did what i had to do to it declares the sovereign lord jehovah
29  in the tenth year in the tenth month on the 12th day of the month the word of jehovah came to me saying
2  son of man turn your face toward pharʹaoh king of egypt and prophesy against him and against all egypt
3  speak these words this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am against you pharʹaoh king of egyptthe great sea monster lying among the streams of his nilewho has said my nile river belongs to me
i made it for myself
4  but i will put hooks in your jaws and cause the fish of your nile to cling to your scales
i will bring you up out of your nile along with all the fish of the nile that cling to your scales
5  i will abandon you in the desert you and all the fish of your nile
you will fall on the open field and you will not be gathered up nor be collected together
i will give you as food to the wild beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky
6  then all the inhabitants of egypt will have to know that i am jehovahfor they were no more support to the house of israel than a piece of straw
7  when they grasped your hand you were crushedand you caused them to tear their shoulder
when they supported themselves on you you were brokenand you caused their legs to wobble
8  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am bringing a sword upon you and i will cut off from you both man and beast
9  the land of egypt will become a desolate and devastated place and they will have to know that i am jehovah for you have said the nile river belongs to me i am the one who made it
10  so i am against you and against your nile and i will make the land of egypt devastated and dry a desolate wasteland from migʹdol to syeʹne to the boundary of ethioʹpia
11  neither man nor livestock will pass through it on foot and it will not be inhabited for 40 years
12  i will make the land of egypt the most desolate of lands and its cities will be the most desolate of cities for 40 years and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands
13  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says after 40 years i will gather back the egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered
14  i will bring the egyptian captives back to the land of pathʹros to the land of their origin and there they will become an insignificant kingdom
15  egypt will become lower than the other kingdoms and will no longer dominate the other nations and i will make them so small that they will not be able to subdue other nations
16  it will never again be a source of confidence for the house of israel but it will only remind them of their error in turning to the egyptians for help
and they will have to know that i am the sovereign lord jehovah
17  now in the 27th year in the first month on the first day of the month the word of jehovah came to me saying
18  son of man king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon made his army labor greatly against tyre
every head became bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare
but he and his army received no wages for the labor he expended on tyre
19  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am giving the land of egypt to king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and he will carry off its wealth and take much spoil and plunder from it and it will become wages for his army
20  as compensation for his labor against her i will give him the land of egypt because they acted for me declares the sovereign lord jehovah
21  in that day i will cause a horn to sprout for the house of israel and i will give you an opportunity to speak among them and they will have to know that i am jehovah
40  in the 25th year of our exile at the beginning of the year on the tenth day of the month in the 14th year after the city had fallen on that very day the hand of jehovah was upon me and he took me to the city
2  by means of visions from god he brought me to the land of israel and set me down on a very high mountain on which there was a structure like a city to the south
3  when he brought me there i saw a man whose appearance was like that of copper
he had a flax cord and a measuring reed in his hand and he was standing in the gateway
4  the man said to me son of man look closely listen carefully and pay attention to everything i show you for that is why you were brought here
tell the house of israel everything that you see
5  i saw a wall surrounding the outside of the temple

3  i will knock your bow out of your left hand and make your arrows fall from your right hand
4  on the mountains of israel you will fall you and all your troops and the peoples who will be with you
i will give you as food to all kinds of birds of prey and the wild beasts of the field
5  you will fall on the open field for i myself have spoken declares the sovereign lord jehovah
6  and i will send fire against maʹgog and against those who are inhabiting the islands in security and they will have to know that i am jehovah
7  i will make my holy name known among my people israel and i will not allow my holy name to be profaned any longer and the nations will have to know that i am jehovah the holy one in israel
8  yes this is coming and it will be done declares the sovereign lord jehovah
this is the day i have spoken about
9  the inhabitants of the cities of israel will go out and make fires with the weaponsthe bucklers and shields the bows and arrows the war clubs and lances
and they will use them to light fires for seven years
10  they will not need to take wood from the field or gather firewood from the forests because they will use the weapons to light fires
they will take spoil from those who despoiled them and plunder from those who had been plundering them declares the sovereign lord jehovah
11  on that day i will give gog a burial place there in israel in the valley of those who travel east of the sea and it will block the path of those passing through
that is where they will bury gog and all his hordes and they will call it the valley of hamongog
12  the house of israel will spend seven months burying them in order to cleanse the land
13  all the people of the land will work at burying them and this will bring them fame in the day that i glorify myself declares the sovereign lord jehovah
14  men will be assigned to pass through the land constantly and bury the bodies left remaining on the surface of the earth in order to cleanse it
they will continue the search for seven months
15  when those who pass through the land see a human bone they will set up a marker beside it
then those assigned to do the burying will bury it in the valley of hamongog
16  and there will also be a city there named hamoʹnah
and they will cleanse the land
17  as for you son of man this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says say to every sort of bird and to all the wild beasts of the field gather yourselves together and come
gather all around my sacrifice that i am preparing for you a great sacrifice on the mountains of israel
you will eat flesh and drink blood
18  you will eat the flesh of mighty ones and drink the blood of the chieftains of the earththe rams lambs goats and bullsall the fattened animals of baʹshan
19  you will gorge yourselves on fat and drink blood until you are drunk from the sacrifice that i prepare for you
20  at my table you will be filled up with horses and charioteers mighty ones and all sorts of warriors declares the sovereign lord jehovah
21  i will display my glory among the nations and all the nations will see the judgment that i have executed and the power that i have demonstrated among them
22  from that day on the house of israel will have to know that i am jehovah their god
23  and the nations will have to know that the house of israel went into exile because of their own error because they were unfaithful to me
so i hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies and they all fell by the sword
24  i dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions and i hid my face from them
25  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will restore the captives of jacob and have mercy on the whole house of israel and i will zealously defend my holy name
26  after they have been humiliated for all their unfaithfulness toward me they will dwell securely on their land with no one to make them afraid
27  when i bring them back from the peoples and collect them together from the lands of their enemies i will also sanctify myself among them before the eyes of many nations
28  they will have to know that i am jehovah their god when i send them into exile among the nations and then gather them back to their land not leaving any of them behind
29  i will not hide my face from them any longer for i will pour out my spirit on the house of israel declares the sovereign lord jehovah
19  you must sing a dirge concerning the chieftains of israel
2  and saywhat was your mother a lioness among lions
she lay down among strong young lions and reared her cubs
3  she raised one of her cubs and he became a strong young lion
he learned how to tear prey aparthe even devoured humans
4  nations heard about him and caught him in their pitand they brought him to the land of egypt with hooks
5  she waited and eventually saw that there was no hope for his return
so she took another of her cubs and sent him out as a strong young lion
6  he also walked about among the lions and became a strong young lion
he learned how to tear prey apart and he even devoured humans
7  he prowled among their fortified towers and devastated their citiesso that the desolate land was filled with the sound of his roaring
8  nations from the surrounding districts came against him to cast their net over himand he was caught in their pit
9  with hooks they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of babylon
there they confined him so that his voice would no more be heard on the mountains of israel
10  your mother was like a vine in your blood planted by waters
it bore fruit and was full of branches because of the abundant water
11  it developed strong branches fit for the scepters of rulers
it grew and towered over the other treesand it became visible because of its height and because of the abundance of its foliage
12  but in fury she was uprooted and thrown to the earthand an east wind dried up her fruit
her strong branches were torn off and became dry and fire consumed them
13  now she is planted in the wildernessin a waterless thirsty land
14  the fire spread from her branches and consumed her shoots and her fruitand there was no strong branch left no scepter for ruling
that is a dirge and it will serve as a dirge
24  the word of jehovah again came to me in the ninth year in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month saying
2  son of man record this date this very day
the king of babylon has begun his attack against jerusalem on this very day
3  and relate a proverb concerning the rebellious house and say concerning them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says put the cooking pot on put it on the fire and pour water into it
4  put pieces of meat into it every good piecethe thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choicest bones
5  take the choicest sheep of the flock and stack the logs all around under the pot
boil the pieces and cook the bones inside it
6  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says woe to the city of bloodshed the rusty cooking pot whose rust has not been removed empty it piece by piece do not cast lots for them
7  for its blood is within it she poured it out on the bare rock
she did not pour it out on the earth to cover it over with dust
8  to stir up rage for executing vengeancei have put her blood on the shining bare rockso that it may not be covered over
9  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says woe to the city of bloodshed i will pile the wood high
10  heap on the logs and kindle the fireboil the flesh thoroughly pour out the broth and let the bones be charred
11  set the empty pot on the coals to make it hotso that its copper will become red hot
its uncleanness will melt away within it and its rust will be consumed
12  it is frustrating and exhaustingfor the heavy rust will not come off
throw it into the fire with its rust
13  your uncleanness was due to your obscene conduct
i tried to cleanse you but you would not become clean from your uncleanness
you will not become clean until my rage against you subsides
14  i myself jehovah have spoken
it will come to pass
i will act without holding back without sorrow without regret
they will judge you according to your ways and your dealings declares the sovereign lord jehovah
15  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
16  son of man in a single blow i am about to take away your dear one from you
you should not mourn nor should you weep or shed tears
17  groan in silence and do not observe mourning rites for the dead
bind on your turban and put on your sandals
you should not cover over the mustache and do not eat the bread brought to you by others
18  and i spoke to the people in the morning and my wife died in the evening
so i did in the morning just as i had been commanded
19  the people were saying to me will you not tell us what these things you are doing have to do with us
20  i replied to them the word of jehovah has come to me saying
21  tell the house of israel this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i am about to profane my sanctuary the source of your great pride the thing dear to you and the desire of your heart
your own sons and daughters whom you left behind will fall by the sword
22  then you will have to do just as i have done
you will not cover over your mustache and you will not eat the bread brought to you by others
23  your turbans will be on your heads and your sandals on your feet
you will not mourn or weep
instead you will rot away in your errors and you will groan to one another
24  ezekiel has become a sign for you
just as he has done you will do
when it happens you will have to know that i am the sovereign lord jehovah
25  and as for you son of man on the day that i take away from them their fortressthe beautiful object of their joy the thing dear to them their hearts desirealong with their sons and daughters
26  it will be reported to you by one who has escaped
27  in that day you will open your mouth and speak to the one who escaped and you will no longer be mute
you will become a sign to them and they will have to know that i am jehovah
43  then he led me to the gate that is facing east
2  there i saw the glory of the god of israel coming from the east and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters and the earth was illuminated by his glory
3  what i saw was like the vision i had seen when i came to bring the city to ruin and it appeared to be like what i had seen near the river cheʹbar and i fell with my face to the ground
4  then the glory of jehovah entered the temple through the gate facing the east
5  a spirit then raised me up and brought me into the inner courtyard and i saw that the temple had become full of the glory of jehovah
6  then i heard someone speaking to me out of the temple and the man came and stood beside me
7  he said to me son of man this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet where i will dwell among the people of israel forever
the house of israel will no longer defile my holy name they and their kings by their spiritual prostitution and by the carcasses of their kings at their death
8  by putting their threshold next to my threshold and their doorpost beside my doorpost with only a wall between me and them they defiled my holy name by the detestable things they did so i exterminated them in my anger
9  now let them put their spiritual prostitution and the carcasses of their kings far away from me and i will dwell among them forever
10  as for you son of man describe the temple to the house of israel so that they will feel ashamed because of their errors and they should study its plan
11  if they feel ashamed of all they have done you should make known to them the ground plan of the temple its arrangement its exits and its entrances
show them all its ground plans and its statutes its ground plans and its laws and write them down before their eyes so that they may observe all its ground plan and carry out its statutes
12  this is the law of the temple
the entire territory all around the top of the mountain is most holy
look this is the law of the temple
13  these are the measurements of the altar in cubits to each cubit a handbreadth was added
its base is a cubit and it is a cubit wide
it has a border all around the edge that is one span in width
this is the base of the altar
14  from the base on the floor to the lower surrounding ledge is two cubits and its width is one cubit
from the small surrounding ledge to the big surrounding ledge is four cubits and its width is a cubit
15  the altar hearth is four cubits high and projecting up from the altar hearth are the four horns
16  the altar hearth is square 12 cubits long and 12 cubits wide
17  the four sides of the surrounding ledge are 14 cubits long and 14 cubits wide and the surrounding border is half a cubit and its base is a cubit on all sides
and its steps are facing east
18  he then said to me son of man this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says these are the directions to follow when the altar is made so that whole burnt offerings may be offered and blood may be sprinkled on it
19  you are to give a young bull of the herd as a sin offering to the levitical priests of the offspring of zaʹdok who approach me to minister to me declares the sovereign lord jehovah
20  you should take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar on the four corners of the surrounding ledge and on the border all around in order to purify it from sin and to make atonement for it
21  then take the young bull the sin offering in order to burn it in the appointed place of the temple outside the sanctuary
22  on the second day you will offer a sound male goat as a sin offering and they will purify the altar from sin just as they purified it from sin with the young bull
23  when you finish purifying it from sin you will offer a sound young bull of the herd and a sound ram from the flock
24  you are to present them to jehovah and the priests must throw salt on them and offer them up as a whole burnt offering to jehovah
25  for seven days you will offer a male goat as a daily sin offering as well as a young bull of the herd and a ram of the flock you will offer unblemished animals
26  for seven days they are to make atonement for the altar and they must cleanse it and install it
27  when the days are completed on the eighth day and thereafter the priests will offer your whole burnt offerings and communion sacrifices on the altar and i will find pleasure in you declares the sovereign lord jehovah
44  he brought me back by way of the outer gate of the sanctuary facing east and it was shut
2  then jehovah said to me this gate will remain shut
it is not to be opened and no human will enter by it for jehovah the god of israel has entered through it so it must remain shut
3  however the chieftain will sit in it to eat bread before jehovah for he is a chieftain
he will come in through the porch of the gate and he will go out through it
4  then he brought me through the north gate to the front of the temple
when i looked i saw that the glory of jehovah had filled the temple of jehovah
so i fell with my face to the ground
5  then jehovah said to me son of man pay attention watch and listen carefully to everything i tell you about the statutes and the laws of the temple of jehovah
pay close attention to the entryway of the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary
6  you must say to the rebellious house of israel this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says that is enough of your detestable practices o house of israel
7  when you bring foreigners who are uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary they profane my temple
you present my bread fat and blood while my covenant is being broken because of all your detestable practices
8  you have not taken care of my holy things
instead you assign others to take care of the duties in my sanctuary
9  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says no foreigner living in israel who is uncircumcised in heart and in flesh may enter my sanctuary
10  but the levites who strayed far from me when israel strayed from me to follow their disgusting idols will bear the consequences of their error
11  and they will become ministers in my sanctuary to oversee the gates of the temple and to minister at the temple
they will slaughter the whole burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people and they will stand before the people to minister to them
12  because they ministered to them before their disgusting idols and became a stumbling block causing the house of israel to sin that is why i have raised my hand against them in an oath declares the sovereign lord jehovah and they will bear the consequences of their error
13  they will not approach me to serve as my priests or approach any of my holy or most holy things and they will bear their shame because of the detestable things that they did
14  but i will make them caretakers of the responsibilities of the temple to take care of its service and all the things that should be done in it
15  as for the levitical priests the sons of zaʹdok who took care of the responsibilities of my sanctuary when the israelites strayed from me they will approach me to minister to me and they will stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood declares the sovereign lord jehovah
16  they are the ones who will enter my sanctuary and they will approach my table to minister to me and they will take care of their responsibilities to me
17  when they come into the gates of the inner courtyard they should wear linen garments
they should not wear any wool when they minister in the gates of the inner courtyard or inside it
18  they should wear linen turbans on their head and linen shorts should cover their hips
they should not wear anything that makes them perspire
19  before they go out to the outer courtyardthe outer courtyard where the people arethey should remove the garments they were ministering in and place them in the holy dining rooms
then they will put on other garments so that they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments
20  they should not shave their head or let the hair of their head grow long
they should trim the hair of their heads
21  the priests should not drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard
22  they should not take a widow or a divorced woman as a wife but they may marry either a virgin of the offspring of israel or the widow of a priest
23  they should instruct my people about the difference between what is holy and what is common and they will teach them the difference between what is unclean and what is clean
24  they should preside as judges in a legal case they must judge it in harmony with my judicial decisions
they should keep my laws and my statutes regarding all my festivals and sanctify my sabbaths
25  they should not approach any dead human or they will become unclean
however they may make themselves unclean for their father mother son daughter brother or an unmarried sister
26  and after the purification of a priest they should count off seven days for him
27  on the day he enters into the holy place into the inner courtyard to minister in the holy place he should present his sin offering declares the sovereign lord jehovah
28  and this will be their inheritance i am their inheritance
you should not give them any possession in israel for i am their possession
29  they will be the ones to eat the grain offering the sin offering and the guilt offering and every devoted thing in israel will become theirs
30  the choicest of all the first ripe fruits and every sort of contribution from you will belong to the priests
and you should give the firstfruits of your coarse meal to the priest
this will cause a blessing to rest on your households
31  the priests should not eat any bird or animal that was found dead or torn to pieces
47  then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple and there i saw water flowing eastward from under the threshold of the temple for the front of the temple was facing east
the water was flowing down from under the right side of the temple south of the altar
2  he then led me out by way of the north gate and took me outside and around to the outer gate that is facing east and i saw water trickling from the right side
3  when the man went out toward the east with a measuring line in his hand he measured off 1000 cubits and had me pass through the water the water was ankle deep
4  then he measured off another 1000 and had me pass through the water and it was up to the knees
he measured off another 1000 and had me pass through and the water was up to the hips
5  when he measured off another 1000 it was a torrent that i was unable to walk across for the water was so deep that one had to swim a torrent of water that could not be crossed on foot
6  he asked me have you seen this son of man then he had me walk and return to the bank of the stream
7  when i returned i saw that on the bank of the stream were very many trees on both sides
8  then he said to me this water flows toward the eastern region and continues down through the arʹabah and enters the sea
when it enters the sea the water there will be healed
9  swarms of living creatures will be able to live wherever the waters flow
there will be an abundance of fish because this water will flow there
the seawater will be healed and everything will live wherever the stream goes
10  fishermen will stand beside it from engedʹi clear to enegʹlaim where there will be a drying yard for dragnets
there will be an abundance of many kinds of fish like the fish of the great sea
11  it will have swampy places and marshy places and these will not be healed
they will be abandoned to salt
12  all sorts of trees for food will grow on both banks of the stream
their leaves will not wither nor will their fruitage fail
each month they will bear new fruit because the water for them flows from the sanctuary
their fruitage will serve as food and their leaves for healing
13  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says this is the territory that you will assign as the land inheritance of the 12 tribes of israel and joseph will have two portions
14  you will inherit it and receive equal shares
i swore to give this land to your forefathers and now it is assigned to you as an inheritance
15  this is the boundary of the land on the northern side it goes from the great sea by the way to hethʹlon toward zeʹdad
16  haʹmath beroʹthah and sibʹraim which is between the territory of damascus and the territory of haʹmath to haʹzerhatʹticon which is by the boundary of hauranʹ

21  you are to apportion this land among yourselves among the 12 tribes of israel
22  you should distribute it for inheritance among yourselves and to the foreigners residing with you who have had children while living among you and they will be like nativeborn israelites to you
they will receive an inheritance among the tribes of israel along with you
23  you should give the foreign resident an inheritance in the territory of the tribe where he has taken up residence declares the sovereign lord jehovah

it will correspond to the holy contribution and its produce will provide food for those serving the city
19  those who are serving the city from all the tribes of israel will cultivate it
20  the whole contribution is 25000 cubits square
you should set it aside as the holy contribution along with the possession of the city
21  what remains on both sides of the holy contribution and of the possession of the city will belong to the chieftain
it will be alongside the 25000 cubit borders that are east and west of the contribution

5  as for you son of man take a sharp sword for yourself to use as a barbers razor
shave your head and your beard and then take scales to weigh and divide the hair into portions
2  you will burn a third of it in the fire inside the city when the days of the siege are completed
then you will take another third and strike it with the sword all around the city and the last third you will scatter to the wind and i will draw a sword to chase after them
3  you must also take a few strands of them and wrap them up in the folds of your garment
4  and take some more of them and throw them into the fire and incinerate them
from this a fire will spread to all the house of israel
5  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says this is jerusalem
i have set her in the middle of the nations with lands all around her
6  but she has rebelled against my judicial decisions and my statutes acting more wickedly than the nations and the lands all around her
for they have rejected my judicial decisions and they did not walk in my statutes
7  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because you were more troublesome than the nations all around you and you did not walk in my statutes or carry out my judicial decisions but instead you followed the judicial decisions of the nations all around you
8  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am against you o city and i myself will execute judgment in your midst before the eyes of the nations
9  i will do in you what i have never done before and the likes of which i will not do again because of all your detestable practices
10  so fathers among you will eat their sons and sons will eat their fathers and i will execute judgment among you and scatter all the rest of you in every direction
11  therefore as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah because it was my sanctuary that you defiled with all your disgusting idols and with all your detestable practices i will also reject you my eye will not feel sorry and i will show no compassion
12  a third of you will die by the pestilence or perish in your midst by famine
another third will fall all around you by the sword
and i will scatter the last third in every direction and i will draw a sword to chase after them
13  then my anger will come to an end and my wrath against them will subside and i will be satisfied
and they will have to know that i jehovah have spoken in my insistence on exclusive devotion when i have finished unleashing my wrath against them
14  i will make you a devastated place and an object of reproach among the surrounding nations and in the eyes of everyone passing by
15  you will become an object of reproach and scorn a warning example and a horror to the nations around you when i execute judgment on you in anger and in wrath and with furious punishments
i jehovah have spoken
16  i will send against them the deadly arrows of famine to destroy them
the arrows that i send will bring you to ruin
i will make the famine worse for you by cutting off your food supply
17  i will send against you famine and vicious wild beasts and they will bereave you of children
pestilence and bloodshed will overwhelm you and i will bring a sword against you
i jehovah have spoken
36  as for you son of man prophesy about the mountains of israel and say o mountains of israel hear the word of jehovah
2  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says the enemy has said against you aha even the ancient high places have become our possession
3  so prophesy and say this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because they have desolated and attacked you from every direction so that you would become a possession of the survivors from among the nations and people keep talking about you and slandering you
4  therefore o mountains of israel hear the word of the sovereign lord jehovah this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says to the mountains and the hills to the streams and the valleys to the ruins that were desolated and to the abandoned cities that have been plundered and ridiculed by the survivors of the nations around them
5  to these the sovereign lord jehovah says in the fire of my zeal i will speak against the survivors of the nations and against all eʹdom those who with great rejoicing and utter scorn have claimed my land as their own possession to take over its pastures and to plunder it
6  so prophesy concerning the land of israel and say to the mountains and to the hills to the streams and to the valleys this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says look i will speak in my zeal and in my rage because you have borne humiliation by the nations
7  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i myself raise my hand in an oath that the surrounding nations will themselves bear their own shame
8  but you o mountains of israel will produce branches and bear your fruitage for my people israel for they will soon return
9  for i am with you and i will turn toward you and you will be cultivated and sown with seed
10  i will multiply your peoplethe whole house of israel all of itand the cities will be inhabited and the ruins will be rebuilt
11  yes i will multiply your people and your livestock they will increase and be fruitful
and i will cause you to be inhabited as you were formerly and i will make you prosper more than in the past and you will have to know that i am jehovah
12  i will cause peoplemy people israelto walk upon you and they will take possession of you
you will become their inheritance and you will never again make them childless
13  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says because they are saying to you you are a land that devours people and bereaves your nations of children
14  therefore you will no longer devour people or make your nations childless declares the sovereign lord jehovah
15  i will not subject you to any more insults of the nations or make you bear the taunts of people and you will no longer cause your nations to stumble declares the sovereign lord jehovah
16  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
17  son of man when the house of israel was dwelling in their land they made it unclean by their ways and their dealings
their ways were like the uncleanness of menstruation to me
18  so i poured out my rage on them because of the blood that they had shed upon the land and because they made the land unclean with their disgusting idols
19  so i scattered them among the nations and dispersed them among the lands
i judged them according to their way and according to their dealings
20  but when they came to those nations people profaned my holy name by saying about them these are the people of jehovah but they had to leave his land
21  so i will show concern for my holy name which the house of israel profaned among the nations where they have gone
22  therefore say to the house of israel this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says not for your sakes am i acting o house of israel but for my holy name which you profaned among the nations where you have gone
23  i will certainly sanctify my great name which was profaned among the nations which you profaned among them and the nations will have to know that i am jehovah declares the sovereign lord jehovah when i am sanctified among you before their eyes
24  i will take you from the nations and gather you back from all the lands and bring you into your land
25  i will sprinkle clean water on you and you will become clean i will cleanse you from all your uncleanness and from all your disgusting idols
26  i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit inside you
i will remove the heart of stone from your body and give you a heart of flesh
27  i will put my spirit inside you and i will cause you to walk in my regulations and you will observe and carry out my judicial decisions
28  then you will dwell in the land that i gave to your forefathers and you will be my people and i will be your god
29  i will save you from all your uncleanness and summon the grain and make it abound and i will not bring famine upon you
30  i will make the fruitage of the tree and the produce of the field abound so that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations
31  then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good and you will loathe yourselves because of your guilt and your detestable practices
32  but know this i am not doing this for your sakes declares the sovereign lord jehovah
instead be ashamed and feel humiliated because of your ways o house of israel
33  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says in the day that i cleanse you from all your guilt i will cause the cities to be inhabited and the ruins to be rebuilt
34  the desolate land that was lying desolate for everyone passing by to see will be cultivated
35  and people will say the desolate land has become like the garden of eʹden and the cities that were in ruins and desolate and torn down are now fortified and inhabited
36  and the nations that are left remaining around you will have to know that i myself jehovah have built what was torn down and i have planted what was desolate
i myself jehovah have spoken and i have done it
37  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will also let the house of israel ask me to do this for them i will multiply their people like a flock
38  like the flock of holy ones like the flock of jerusalem during her festivals the cities that were in ruins will become full of flocks of people and they will have to know that i am jehovah
41  then he brought me into the outer sanctuary and he measured the side pillars they were six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side
2  the entrance was ten cubits wide and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side
he measured its length which was 40 cubits and its width 20 cubits
3  he then went inside and measured the side pillar of the entrance and it was two cubits thick and the entrance was six cubits wide
the sidewalls of the entrance were seven cubits
4  next he measured the room facing the outer sanctuary and it was 20 cubits long and 20 cubits wide
and he said to me this is the most holy
5  then he measured the wall of the temple and it was six cubits thick
the side chambers around the temple were four cubits wide
6  the side chambers were three stories high one on top of the other with 30 chambers on each story
there were ledges around the wall of the temple that served as supports for the side chambers so that the supports did not go into the wall of the temple itself
7  on both sides of the temple was a winding passage that widened as it ascended to the upper chambers
the width increased from story to story as one ascended from the lowest story to the uppermost story by passing through the middle story
8  i saw that there was a raised platform all around the temple and the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six cubits to the corner
9  the width of the outside wall of the side chambers was five cubits
there was an open space alongside the structure of the side chambers that was part of the temple
10  between the temple and the dining rooms was an area that was 20 cubits wide on each side
11  there was an entrance between the side chambers and the open space on the north side and another entrance on the south side
the width of the open space was five cubits all around
12  the building that was on the west facing the open area was 70 cubits wide and 90 cubits long the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around
13  he measured the temple and it was 100 cubits long
the open area the building and its walls were also 100 cubits long
14  the width of the front of the temple facing east and the open area was 100 cubits
15  he measured the length of the building that faced the open area in the rear along with its galleries on both sides and it was 100 cubits
he also measured the outer sanctuary the inner sanctuary and the porches of the courtyard
16  as well as the thresholds the windows with narrowing frames and the galleries that were in those three areas
near the threshold were wood panels from the floor up to the windows and the windows were covered
17  measurements were taken above the entrance and in the inner temple and on the outside and on the entire wall all around
18  it had carved cherubs and palmtree figures with each palm tree between two cherubs and each cherub had two faces
19  the human face was toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion was toward the palm tree on the other side
they were carved this way throughout the entire temple
20  from the floor to the area above the entrance were carved cherubs and palmtree figures on the wall of the sanctuary
21  the doorposts of the sanctuary were square
in front of the holy place was something like
22  a wooden altar that was three cubits high and two cubits long
it had corner posts and its base and its sides were made of wood
he then said to me this is the table that is before jehovah
23  the outer sanctuary and the holy place each had two doors
24  the doors had two swinging leaves two leaves for each door
25  there were carved cherubs and palmtree figures on the doors of the sanctuary like those on the walls
there was also a wooden overhang on the front of the porch on the outside
26  there were also windows with narrowing frames and palmtree figures along both sides of the porch as well as along the side chambers of the temple and the overhangs
15  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man how does the wood of the vine compare with that of any other tree or branch from the trees of the forest
3  can a pole from it be used to do work or do people make a peg from it to hang utensils on
4  look it is thrown into the fire for fuel and the fire consumes both ends and scorches the middle
is it now fit for any work
5  even when it was whole it could not be used for anything
how much less useful it will be when the fire has consumed and scorched it
6  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says just like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest which i have given as fuel for the fire so i will deal with the inhabitants of jerusalem
7  i have set my face against them
they have escaped from the fire but fire will consume them
and you will have to know that i am jehovah when i set my face against them
8  and i will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully declares the sovereign lord jehovah
20  now in the seventh year in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month some of the elders of israel came and sat down before me to inquire of jehovah
2  then the word of jehovah came to me saying
3  son of man speak with the elders of israel and tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says are you coming to inquire of me as surely as i am alive i will not respond to your inquiry declares the sovereign lord jehovah
4  are you ready to judge them are you ready to judge them son of man make them know the detestable things that their forefathers did
5  tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says in the day i chose israel i also swore to the offspring of the house of jacob and i made myself known to them in the land of egypt
yes i swore to them and said i am jehovah your god
6  in that day i swore that i would bring them out of the land of egypt to a land that i had searched out for them one flowing with milk and honey
it was the most beautiful of all the lands
7  i then said to them each of you must throw away the detestable things that are before your eyes do not defile yourselves with the disgusting idols of egypt
i am jehovah your god
8  but they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me
they did not throw away the detestable things that were before them and they would not abandon the disgusting idols of egypt
so i promised to pour out my rage on them and to unleash my anger fully against them in the land of egypt
9  but i acted for the sake of my name so that it would not be profaned before the nations among whom they were living
for i made myself known to them before these nations when i brought them out of the land of egypt
10  so i brought them out of the land of egypt and led them into the wilderness
11  i then gave them my statutes and made my judicial decisions known to them so that the man who follows them may have life by them
12  i also gave my sabbaths to them as a sign between me and them so that they would know that i jehovah am the one sanctifying them
13  but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness
they did not walk in my statutes and they rejected my judicial decisions which if a man follows them he will have life by them
they utterly profaned my sabbaths
so i promised to pour out my fury on them in the wilderness to exterminate them
14  i acted for the sake of my own name so that it would not be profaned before the nations in whose sight i brought them out
15  i also swore to them in the wilderness that i would not bring them into the land that i had given thema land flowing with milk and honey the most beautiful of all the lands
16  because they rejected my judicial decisions they did not walk in my statutes and they profaned my sabbaths for their heart was following after their disgusting idols
17  but i felt sorry for them and i did not destroy them i did not exterminate them in the wilderness
18  i said to their sons in the wilderness do not walk in the regulations of your forefathers or keep their judgments or defile yourselves with their disgusting idols
19  i am jehovah your god
walk in my statutes and keep my judicial decisions and carry them out
20  and sanctify my sabbaths and they will serve as a sign between me and you for you to know that i am jehovah your god
21  but the sons began to rebel against me
they did not walk in my statutes and they did not observe and carry out my judicial decisions which if a man follows them he will have life by them
my sabbaths they profaned
so i promised to pour out my rage on them and to unleash my anger against them fully in the wilderness
22  but i refrained and acted for the sake of my own name so that it should not be profaned before the nations in whose sight i brought them out
23  also i swore to them in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands
24  because they did not carry out my judicial decisions and they rejected my statutes they profaned my sabbaths and they followed after the disgusting idols of their forefathers
25  i also allowed them to follow regulations that were not good and judicial decisions by which they could not have life
26  i let them become defiled by their own sacrificeswhen they made every firstborn child pass through the firein order to make them desolate so that they would know that i am jehovah
27  so speak to the house of israel o son of man and tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says in this way also your forefathers blasphemed me by acting unfaithfully against me
28  i brought them into the land that i swore to give them
when they saw all the high hills and leafy trees they began offering their sacrifices and their offensive offerings
they presented the pleasing aromas of their sacrifices and poured out their drink offerings there
29  so i asked them what is the meaning of this high place to which you go it is still called high place to this day
30  now say to the house of israel this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says are you defiling yourselves the same way your forefathers did by going after their disgusting idols to commit spiritual prostitution with them
31  and are you still defiling yourselves to this day by offering sacrifices to all your disgusting idols making your sons pass through the fire should i at the same time respond to your inquiry o house of israel as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah i will not respond to your inquiry
32  and what you have in mind when you say let us become like the nations like the families of the other lands who worship wood and stone it will never happen
33  as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah i will rule as king over you with a mighty hand with an outstretched arm and with an outpouring of rage
34  i will bring you out from the peoples and collect you together out of the lands where you have been scattered with a mighty hand with an outstretched arm and with an outpouring of rage
35  i will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples and enter into judgment with you there facetoface
36  just as i entered into judgment with your forefathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt so i will enter into judgment with you declares the sovereign lord jehovah
37  i will make you pass under the shepherds staff and bring you under obligation to the covenant
38  but i will remove from you the rebels and those transgressing against me
for i will bring them out of the land of their foreign residence but they will not enter the land of israel and you will have to know that i am jehovah
39  as for you o house of israel this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says each of you go and serve his disgusting idols
but afterward if you do not listen to me you will no longer be able to profane my holy name by your sacrifices and your disgusting idols
40  for in my holy mountain on a high mountain of israel declares the sovereign lord jehovah is where the whole house of israel all of them will serve me in the land
i will take pleasure in them there and i will require your contributions and the firstfruits of your offerings all your holy things
41  because of the pleasing aroma i will take pleasure in you when i bring you out from the peoples and collect you together from the lands to which you have been scattered and i will be sanctified among you before the eyes of the nations
42  and you will have to know that i am jehovah when i bring you to the land of israel into the land that i swore to give to your forefathers
43  and there you will remember your conduct and all your deeds by which you defiled yourselves and you will loathe yourselves because of all the bad things that you did
44  then you will have to know that i am jehovah when i deal with you for the sake of my name not according to your wicked conduct or according to your corrupted dealings o house of israel declares the sovereign lord jehovah
45  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
46  son of man turn your face in the direction of the southern quarter and proclaim to the south and prophesy to the forest of the field of the south
47  say to the forest of the south hear the word of jehovah
this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am setting a fire ablaze against you and it will consume every green tree and every dry tree in you
the burning flame will not be extinguished and every face will be scorched by it from south to north
48  and all flesh will see that i myself jehovah have set it afire so that it will not be extinguished
49  and i said alas o sovereign lord jehovah they are saying about me is he not just speaking in riddles
1  in the 30th year on the fifth day of the fourth month while i was among the exiled people by the river cheʹbar the heavens were opened and i began to see visions of god
2  on the fifth day of the monththat is in the fifth year of the exile of king jehoiʹachin
3  the word of jehovah came to ezekiel son of buʹzi the priest by the river cheʹbar in the land of the chaldeʹans
there the hand of jehovah came upon him
4  as i was looking i saw a tempestuous wind coming from the north and there was a huge cloud and flashing fire surrounded by a bright light and from the midst of the fire was something that looked like electrum
5  within it were what looked like four living creatures and the appearance of each one was like that of a human
6  each one had four faces and four wings
7  their feet were straight and the soles of their feet were like those of a calf and they were shining like the glow of burnished copper
8  they had human hands under their wings on all four sides and the four of them had faces and wings
9  their wings were touching one another
they would not turn when they went they would each go straight forward
10  their faces had this appearance each of the four had a mans face with a lions face on the right a bulls face on the left and each of the four had an eagles face
11  that is how their faces were
their wings were spread out above them
each had two wings that were touching one another and two wings covering their bodies
12  they would each go straight forward going wherever the spirit would incline them to go
they would not turn as they went
13  and the living creatures had the appearance of burning coals of fire and something that looked like torches of bright fire was moving back and forth between the living creatures and lightning was flashing out from the fire
14  and when the living creatures would go forth and return their movement had the appearance of flashes of lightning
15  as i was watching the living creatures i saw one wheel on the earth beside each of the living creatures with four faces
16  the wheels and their structure appeared to glow like chrysʹolite and the four of them looked alike
their appearance and structure looked as though a wheel were within a wheel
17  when they moved they could go in any of the four directions without turning as they went
18  their rims were so high that they inspired awe and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around
19  whenever the living creatures moved the wheels would move along with them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels would also be lifted up
20  they would go where the spirit inclined them to go wherever the spirit went
the wheels would be lifted up together with them for the spirit operating on the living creatures was also in the wheels
21  when they moved these would move and when they stood still these would stand still and when they were lifted up from the earth the wheels would be lifted up together with them for the spirit operating on the living creatures was also in the wheels
22  over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of an expanse that sparkled like awesome ice stretched out above their heads
23  under the expanse their wings were straight one to the other
each one had two wings for covering one side of their bodies and two for covering the other side
24  when i heard the sound of their wings it was like a sound of rushing waters like the sound of the almighty
when they moved it was like the sound of an army
when they stood still they would let their wings down
25  there was a voice above the expanse over their heads
when they stood still they would let their wings down
26  above the expanse that was over their heads was what looked like a sapphire stone and it resembled a throne
sitting on the throne up above was someone whose appearance resembled that of a human
27  i saw something glowing like electrum that was like a fire radiating from what appeared to be his waist and upward and from his waist down i saw something that resembled fire
there was a brilliance all around him
28  like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day
that was how the surrounding brilliant light appeared
it was like the appearance of the glory of jehovah
when i saw it i fell facedown and began to hear the voice of someone speaking
2  he then said to me son of man stand up on your feet that i may speak with you
2  when he spoke to me spirit came into me and made me stand up on my feet so that i could hear the one speaking to me
3  he went on to say to me son of man i am sending you to the people of israel to rebellious nations that have rebelled against me
they and their forefathers have transgressed against me down to this very day
4  i am sending you to sons who are defiant and hardhearted and you must say to them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says
5  as for them whether they listen or refuse to listenfor they are a rebellious housethey will certainly know that a prophet was among them
6  but you son of man do not be afraid of them and do not be afraid of their words although you are surrounded by briars and thorns and are dwelling among scorpions
do not be afraid of their words and do not be terrified by their faces for they are a rebellious house
7  you must speak my words to them whether they listen or not for they are a rebellious people
8  but you son of man listen to what i am telling you
do not become rebellious like this rebellious house
open your mouth and eat what i am giving you
9  when i looked i saw a hand stretched out to me and in it i saw a written scroll
10  when he spread it out before me it had writing on both front and back
dirges and mourning and wailing were written on it
3  then he said to me son of man eat what is before you
eat this scroll and go speak to the house of israel
2  so i opened my mouth and he made me eat this scroll
3  he went on to say to me son of man eat this scroll that i am giving you and fill your stomach with it
so i began to eat it and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth
4  he said to me son of man go in among the house of israel and speak my words to them
5  for you are not being sent to a people who speak an unintelligible language or an unknown tongue but to the house of israel
6  you are not being sent to many peoples speaking an unintelligible language or an unknown tongue whose words you cannot understand
if i would send you to them they would listen to you
7  but the house of israel will refuse to listen to you for they do not want to listen to me
all those of the house of israel are hardheaded and hardhearted
8  look i have made your face exactly as hard as their faces and your forehead exactly as hard as their foreheads
9  i have made your forehead like a diamond harder than flint
do not be afraid of them or be terrified by their faces for they are a rebellious house
10  he went on to say to me son of man take to heart and listen to all my words that i speak to you
11  go in among the exiles of your people and speak to them
tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says whether they listen or refuse to listen
12  a spirit then carried me along and i heard behind me a great rumbling sound that said may the glory of jehovah be praised from his place
13  there was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they were brushing against one another and the sound of the wheels next to them and the sound of a great rumbling
14  and the spirit carried me along and took me and i went in bitterness and in the rage of my spirit and the hand of jehovah rested strongly on me
15  so i went to the exiled people at telaʹbib who were dwelling by the river cheʹbar and i stayed there where they were dwelling and in a dazed condition i stayed among them for seven days
16  at the end of seven days the word of jehovah came to me
17  son of man i have appointed you as a watchman to the house of israel and when you hear a word from my mouth you must warn them from me
18  when i say to someone wicked you will surely die but you do not warn him and you fail to speak in order to warn the wicked one to turn from his wicked course so that he may stay alive he will die for his error because he is wicked but i will ask his blood back from you
19  but if you warn someone wicked and he does not turn back from his wickedness and from his wicked course he will die for his error but you will certainly save your own life
20  but when someone righteous abandons his righteousness and does what is wrong i will put a stumbling block before him and he will die
if you did not warn him he will die for his sin and his righteous acts will not be remembered but i will ask his blood back from you
21  but if you have warned the righteous one not to sin and he does not sin he will surely keep alive because he was warned and you will have saved your own life
22  the hand of jehovah came upon me there and he said to me get up go to the valley plain and i will speak with you there
23  so i got up and went to the valley plain and look the glory of jehovah was there like the glory that i saw by the river cheʹbar and i fell facedown
24  then spirit entered into me and made me stand up on my feet and he spoke to me and said go shut yourself inside your house
25  as for you son of man they will put ropes on you and tie you with them so that you cannot go out among them
26  and i will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth and you will become mute unable to reprove them because they are a rebellious house
27  but when i speak with you i will open your mouth and you must say to them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says
let the one listening listen and let the one refusing to listen refuse because they are a rebellious house
33  and the word of jehovah came to me saying
2  son of man speak to the sons of your people and say to themsuppose that i bring a sword upon a land and all the people of that land take a man and make him their watchman
3  and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the horn and warns the people
4  if someone hears the sound of the horn but does not heed the warning and a sword comes and takes his life his blood will be on his own head
5  he heard the sound of the horn but he did not heed the warning
his blood will be upon himself
if he had heeded the warning his life would have been saved
6  but if the watchman sees the sword coming and he does not blow the horn and the people receive no warning and a sword comes and takes the life of one of them that person will die for his own error but i will ask his blood back from the watchman
7  as for you son of man i have appointed you as a watchman to the house of israel and when you hear a word from my mouth you must warn them from me
8  when i say to someone wicked wicked one you will surely die but you do not speak out to warn the wicked one to change his course he will die as a wicked man because of his own error but i will ask his blood back from you
9  but if you warn someone wicked to turn back from his way and he refuses to change his course he will die for his error but you will certainly save your own life
10  and you son of man say to the house of israel you have said our revolts and our sins weigh heavily upon us causing us to waste away so how will we keep living
11  tell them as surely as i am alive declares the sovereign lord jehovah i take no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that someone wicked changes his way and keeps living
turn back turn back from your bad ways for why should you die o house of israel
12  and you son of man tell the sons of your people the righteousness of the righteous man will not save him when he revolts nor will the wickedness of the wicked man make him stumble when he turns away from his wickedness nor will anyone righteous be able to keep living because of his righteousness in the day that he sins
13  when i say to the righteous one you will surely keep living and he trusts in his own righteousness and does what is wrong none of his righteous acts will be remembered but he will die for the wrong that he has done
14  and when i say to the wicked one you will surely die and he turns away from his sin and does what is just and righteous
15  and the wicked one returns what was taken in pledge and pays back what was taken by robbery and he walks in the statutes of life by not doing what is wrong he will surely keep living
he will not die
16  none of the sins he committed will be held against him
for doing what is just and righteous he will surely keep living
17  but your people have said the way of jehovah is unjust when it is actually their way that is unjust
18  when someone righteous abandons his righteousness and does what is wrong he must die for it
19  but when someone wicked turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and righteous he will keep living for doing so
20  but you have said the way of jehovah is unjust
i will judge each of you according to his ways o house of israel
21  at length in the 12th year in the tenth month on the fifth day of the month of our exile a man who had escaped from jerusalem came to me and said the city has been struck down
22  now the evening before the escaped man came the hand of jehovah had come upon me and he had opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning
so my mouth was opened and i was no longer speechless
23  then the word of jehovah came to me saying
24  son of man the inhabitants of these ruins are saying concerning the land of israel abraham was just one man and yet he took possession of the land
but we are many surely the land has been given to us as a possession
25  therefore say to them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says you are eating food with the blood and you lift up your eyes to your disgusting idols and you keep shedding blood
so why should you possess the land
26  you have relied on your sword you engage in detestable practices and each of you has defiled his neighbors wife
so why should you possess the land
27  this is what you should say to them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says as surely as i am alive those living in the ruins will fall by the sword those in the open field i will give as food to the wild beasts and those in the strongholds and the caves will die by disease
28  i will make the land an utterly desolate wasteland and its arrogant pride will be brought to an end and the mountains of israel will be desolated with no one passing through
29  and they will have to know that i am jehovah when i make the land an utterly desolate wasteland because of all the detestable things that they have done
30  as for you son of man your people are speaking with one another about you beside the walls and in the doorways of the houses
they are saying to each other each to his brother come and let us hear the word that comes from jehovah
31  they will crowd in to sit before you as my people and they will hear your words but they will not do them
for with their mouth they flatter you but their heart is greedy for dishonest gain
32  look you are to them like a romantic love song sung with a beautiful voice and skillfully played on a stringed instrument
they will hear your words but no one will act on them
33  and when it comes trueand it will come truethey will have to know that a prophet has been among them
12  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  son of man you are living in a rebellious house
they have eyes to see but they do not see and ears to hear but they do not hear for they are a rebellious house
3  as for you son of man prepare for yourself luggage for going into exile
then during the day while they are watching you must go into exile
go into exile from your home to another place while they are watching
perhaps they will take notice even though they are a rebellious house
4  bring out your luggage packed for going into exile during the day while they are watching and then in the evening while they are watching you should leave like someone being taken into exile
5  while they are watching bore a hole in the wall and carry your belongings out through it
6  while they are watching put your belongings on your shoulder and carry them out in the darkness
cover your face so that you cannot see the ground for i am making you a sign to the house of israel
7  i did just as i was commanded
during the day i brought out my luggage as luggage for going into exile and in the evening i bored a hole through the wall by hand
and when it was dark i took out my belongings carrying them on my shoulder right before their eyes
8  in the morning the word of jehovah again came to me saying
9  son of man did not the house of israel the rebellious house ask you what are you doing
10  tell them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says this pronouncement concerns the chieftain in jerusalem and all the house of israel within the city
11  say i am a sign for you
just as i have done that is what will be done to them
they will go into exile into captivity
12  the chieftain who is among them will carry his belongings on his shoulder and leave in the darkness
he will bore a hole in the wall and carry his belongings out through it
he will cover his face so that he cannot see the ground
13  i will cast my net over him and he will be caught in my hunting net
then i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeʹans but he will not see it and there he will die
14  and all those around him his helpers and his troops i will scatter in every direction and i will draw out a sword to chase after them
15  and they will have to know that i am jehovah when i disperse them among the nations and i scatter them among the lands
16  but i will spare a few of them from the sword the famine and the pestilence so that they may tell about all their detestable practices among the nations where they will go and they will have to know that i am jehovah
17  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
18  son of man you should eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with agitation and anxiety
19  say to the people of the land this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says to the inhabitants of jerusalem in the land of israel they will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror for their land will become completely desolate because of the violence of all those dwelling in it
20  the inhabited cities will be devastated and the land will become a wasteland and you will have to know that i am jehovah
21  and the word of jehovah again came to me saying
22  son of man what is this proverb that you have in israel that says the days go by and every vision comes to nothing
23  therefore say to them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says i will cause this saying to cease and they will no more use it as a proverb in israel
but tell them the days are near and every vision will take place
24  for there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of israel
25  for i jehovah will speak
whatever word i speak will be done without any more delay
in your days o rebellious house i will say the word and carry it out declares the sovereign lord jehovah
26  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
27  son of man this is what the people of israel are saying the vision that he sees is for a long time from now and he is prophesying about the distant future
28  therefore say to them this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says none of my words will be delayed whatever i say will be done declares the sovereign lord jehovah
