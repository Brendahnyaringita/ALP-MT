10  now aʹhab had 70 sons in samarʹia
so jeʹhu wrote letters and sent them to samarʹia to the princes of jezʹreel the elders and the guardians of aʹhabs children saying
2  now when this letter comes to you the sons of your lord will be with you as well as the war chariots the horses a fortified city and weapons
3  select the best and most suitable of the sons of your lord and put him on the throne of his father
then fight for the house of your lord
4  but they were overcome with fear and said look if two kings could not stand before him how can we stand
5  so the overseer of the palace the governor of the city the elders and the guardians sent this message to jeʹhu we are your servants and we will do everything that you tell us
we will not make anyone king
do whatever seems good in your eyes
6  then he wrote them a second letter saying if you belong to me and are willing to obey me bring the heads of the sons of your lord and come to me tomorrow at this time at jezʹreel
now the 70 sons of the king were with the distinguished men of the city who were raising them
7  as soon as the letter came to them they took the sons of the king and slaughtered them 70 men and they put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at jezʹreel
8  the messenger came in and told him they have brought the heads of the sons of the king
so he said put them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate until morning
9  when he went out in the morning he stood before all the people and said you are innocent
yes i conspired against my lord and i killed him but who struck down all of these
10  know then that not a single word of jehovahs that jehovah has spoken against the house of aʹhab will go unfulfilled and jehovah has done what he spoke through his servant eliʹjah
11  moreover jeʹhu struck down all who were left of the house of aʹhab in jezʹreel as well as all his distinguished men his acquaintances and his priests until he had left him no survivor
12  then he got up and went on his way to samarʹia
the binding house of the shepherds was on the way
13  there jeʹhu encountered the brothers of king ahaziʹah of judah and he said to them who are you they said we are the brothers of ahaziʹah and we are on our way down to ask if all is well with the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother
14  immediately he said capture them alive so they captured them alive and slaughtered them at the cistern of the binding house 42 men
he did not let a single one of them survive
15  as he went from there he encountered jehonʹadab the son of reʹchab who was coming to meet him
when he greeted him he said to him is your heart fully with me just as my heart is with your heart jehonʹadab replied it is
if so give me your hand
so he gave him his hand and jeʹhu pulled him up into the chariot with him
16  then he said come along with me and see my toleration of no rivalry toward jehovah
so they had him ride with him in his war chariot
17  then he came to samarʹia and he struck down all who were left over of aʹhabs house in samarʹia until he had annihilated them according to jehovahs word that he had spoken to eliʹjah
18  further jeʹhu collected all the people together and said to them aʹhab worshipped baʹal a little but jeʹhu will worship him much more
19  so summon all the prophets of baʹal all his worshippers and all his priests to me
do not let a single one be absent because i have a great sacrifice for baʹal
anyone who is absent will not live
but jeʹhu was acting with cunning to destroy the worshippers of baʹal
20  jeʹhu continued declare a solemn assembly for baʹal
so they proclaimed it
21  after that jeʹhu sent word throughout israel and all the worshippers of baʹal came
not a single one was left out who did not come
they entered the house of baʹal and the house of baʹal was filled from end to end
22  he said to the one who was in charge of the wardrobe bring out garments for all the worshippers of baʹal
so he brought out the clothing for them
23  then jeʹhu and jehonʹadab the son of reʹchab went into the house of baʹal
he now said to the worshippers of baʹal search carefully and see that there are no worshippers of jehovah here only worshippers of baʹal
24  finally they came in to offer up sacrifices and burnt offerings
jeʹhu had stationed 80 of his men outside and said if any one of the men i am putting into your hands escapes it will be your life for his
25  as soon as he finished offering up the burnt offering jeʹhu said to the guards and the adjutants come in and strike them down do not let a single one escape so the guards and the adjutants struck them down with the sword and threw them out and they kept going as far as the inner sanctuary of the house of baʹal
26  then they brought out the sacred pillars of the house of baʹal and burned each one
27  they tore down the sacred pillar of baʹal and they tore down the house of baʹal and turned it into latrines as it remains to this day
28  thus jeʹhu annihilated baʹal out of israel
29  however jeʹhu did not turn away from the sins that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had caused israel to commit as regards the golden calves that were in bethʹel and in dan
30  so jehovah said to jeʹhu because you have acted well and have done what is right in my eyes by carrying out all that was in my heart to do to the house of aʹhab four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of israel
31  but jeʹhu did not take care to walk in the law of jehovah the god of israel with all his heart
he did not turn away from the sins that jeroboʹam had caused israel to commit
32  in those days jehovah started to cut off israel piece by piece
hazʹael kept attacking them throughout the territory of israel
33  from the jordan eastward all the land of gilʹeadof the gadʹites the reuʹbenites and the manasʹsitesfrom aroʹer which is by the arʹnon valley to gilʹead and baʹshan
34  and the rest of the history of jeʹhu all that he did and all his mightiness is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
35  then jeʹhu was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in samarʹia and his son jehoʹahaz became king in his place
36  the length of jeʹhus reign over israel was 28 years in samarʹia
4  now one of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to eliʹsha saying your servant my husband is dead and you well know that your servant had always feared jehovah
now a creditor has come to take both of my children as his slaves
2  at this eliʹsha said to her what can i do for you tell me what do you have in the house she replied your servant has nothing at all in the house but a jar of oil
3  then he said go outside ask for containers from all your neighbors empty containers
do not limit yourself to a few
4  then go in and close the door behind you and your sons
fill all these containers and set the full ones aside
5  so she left him
when she closed the door behind her and her sons they passed the containers to her and she kept pouring
6  when the containers were full she said to one of her sons bring another container to me
but he said to her there are no more containers
at that the oil stopped
7  so she came in and told the man of the true god and he said go sell the oil and pay off your debts and you and your sons can live from what is left
8  one day eliʹsha went to shuʹnem where there was a prominent woman and she urged him to eat a meal there
as often as he would pass by he would stop there to eat
9  so she said to her husband i know that it is a holy man of god who comes this way regularly
10  please let us make a small room on the roof and put there for him a bed a table a chair and a lampstand
then whenever he comes to us he can stay there
11  one day he came there and he went to the room on the roof to lie down
12  he then said to gehaʹzi his attendant call this shuʹnammite woman
so he called her and she stood before him
13  then he said to gehaʹzi please tell her here you have gone to all this trouble for us
what can be done for you should i speak in your behalf to the king or to the chief of the army but her reply was i am living among my own people
14  so he said then what can be done for her gehaʹzi now said well she does not have a son and her husband is old
15  immediately he said call her
so he called her and she stood at the doorway
16  then he said at this time next year you will be embracing a son
but she said no my master man of the true god do not tell lies to your servant
17  however the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son at the same time the next year just as eliʹsha had told her
18  the child grew up and one day he went out to his father who was with the reapers
19  he kept saying to his father my head o my head then his father said to the attendant carry him to his mother
20  so he carried him back to his mother and he sat on her lap until noon and then he died
21  then she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of the true god and she shut the door behind her and left
22  she now called her husband and said send me please one of the attendants and one of the donkeys and let me go quickly to the man of the true god and return
23  but he said why are you going to see him today it is not a new moon or a sabbath
however she said everything is all right
24  so she saddled the donkey and said to her attendant go quickly
do not slow down for me unless i tell you to
25  so she went to the man of the true god at mount carʹmel
as soon as the man of the true god saw her from afar he said to gehaʹzi his attendant look the shuʹnammite woman is over there
26  please run to meet her and ask her are you well is your husband well is your child well to this she said all is well
27  when she came to the man of the true god at the mountain she at once grabbed hold of his feet
at this gehaʹzi came near to push her away but the man of the true god said let her alone for she is in bitter distress and jehovah has hidden it from me and has not told me
28  she then said did i ask my lord for a son did i not say you must not give me a false hope
29  he immediately said to gehaʹzi wrap your garments around your waist and take my staff in your hand and go
if you encounter anyone do not greet him and if anyone should greet you do not answer him
go and place my staff on the boys face
30  at this the boys mother said as surely as jehovah is living and as you yourself are living i will not leave you
so he got up and went with her
31  gehaʹzi went before them and put the staff on the boys face but there was no sound or response
he went back to meet eliʹsha and told him the boy did not wake up
32  when eliʹsha came into the house the boy was lying dead on his bed
33  he went in and closed the door behind them both and began to pray to jehovah
34  then he got up on the bed and lay down on the child and put his own mouth on the boys mouth his own eyes on his eyes and his own palms on his palms and kept bent over him and the childs body started to grow warm
35  he walked back and forth in the house and he got up on the bed and bent over him again
the boy sneezed seven times after which he opened his eyes
36  eliʹsha now called gehaʹzi and said call the shuʹnammite woman
so he called her and she came in to him
then he said pick up your son
37  and she came in and fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground before him after which she picked up her son and went out
38  when eliʹsha returned to gilʹgal there was famine in the land
the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said to his attendant put the large pot on and boil stew for the sons of the prophets
39  so one of them went out to the field to pick mallows and he found a wild vine and picked wild gourds from it filling his garment
he then returned and sliced them into the stewpot not knowing what they were
40  they later served it to the men to eat but as soon as they ate from the stew they cried out there is death in the pot o man of the true god
and they could not eat it
41  so he said bring some flour
after he threw it into the pot he said serve it to the people
and nothing harmful was in the pot
42  a man came from baʹalshalʹishah and he brought the man of the true god 20 loaves of barley bread made from the first ripe fruits as well as a bag of new grain
then eliʹsha said give it to the people so that they may eat
43  however his attendant said how can i set this before 100 men to this he said give it to the people so that they may eat for this is what jehovah says they will eat and have some left over
44  at that he put it before them and they ate and they had some left over according to the word of jehovah
11  now when athaliʹah ahaziʹahs mother saw that her son had died she rose up and destroyed the entire royal line
2  however jehoshʹeba the daughter of king jehoʹram ahaziʹahs sister took jehoʹash the son of ahaziʹah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were to be put to death keeping him and his nurse in an inner bedroom
they managed to keep him concealed from athaliʹah so he was not put to death
3  he remained with her for six years hidden at the house of jehovah while athaliʹah was ruling over the land
4  in the seventh year jehoiʹada sent for the chiefs of hundreds of the caʹrian bodyguard and of the palace guards and had them come to him at the house of jehovah
he made a pact with them and had them swear to it at the house of jehovah and then he showed them the son of the king
5  he ordered them this is what you are to do one third of you will be on duty on the sabbath and will keep strict watch over the kings house
6  another third will be at the gate of the foundation and another third will be at the gate behind the palace guards
you will take turns watching over the house
7  your two divisions that are supposed to be off duty on the sabbath must keep strict watch over the house of jehovah to protect the king
8  you must surround the king on every side each with his weapons in hand
anyone entering within the ranks will be put to death
stay with the king wherever he goes
9  the chiefs of hundreds did exactly what jehoiʹada the priest had commanded
so each one took his men who were on duty on the sabbath together with those who were off duty on the sabbath and they came in to jehoiʹada the priest
10  the priest then gave the chiefs of hundreds the spears and the circular shields that had belonged to king david which were in the house of jehovah
11  and the palace guards took their positions each with his weapons in hand from the right side of the house to the left side of the house by the altar and by the house all around the king
12  then jehoiʹada brought the kings son out and put on him the crown and the testimony and they made him king and anointed him
they began to clap their hands and say long live the king
13  when athaliʹah heard the sound of the people running she immediately came to the people at the house of jehovah
14  then she saw the king standing there by the pillar according to the custom
the chiefs and the trumpeters were with the king and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets
at this athaliʹah ripped her garments apart and cried out conspiracy conspiracy
15  but jehoiʹada the priest commanded the chiefs of hundreds those appointed over the army and said to them take her out from among the ranks and if anyone follows her put him to death with the sword for the priest had said do not put her to death in the house of jehovah
16  so they seized her and when she reached the place where the horses enter the kings house she was put to death there
17  then jehoiʹada made a covenant between jehovah and the king and the people that they would continue as the people of jehovah and he also made a covenant between the king and the people
18  after that all the people of the land came to the house of baʹal and tore down his altars completely smashed his images and killed matʹtan the priest of baʹal in front of the altars
then the priest appointed overseers over the house of jehovah
19  further he took the chiefs of hundreds the caʹrian bodyguard the palace guards and all the people of the land to escort the king down from the house of jehovah and they came to the kings house by the way of the gate of the palace guard
he then sat on the throne of the kings
20  so all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet for they had put athaliʹah to death with the sword at the kings house
21  jehoʹash was seven years old when he became king
8  eliʹsha said to the woman whose son he had restored to life rise up and go you with your household and live as a foreigner wherever you can for jehovah has declared a famine and it will come on the land for seven years
2  so the woman got up and did what the man of the true god said
she went with her household and settled in the land of the philisʹtines for seven years
3  at the end of seven years the woman returned from the land of the philisʹtines and went to appeal to the king for her house and her field
4  now the king was speaking to gehaʹzi the attendant of the man of the true god saying relate to me please all the great things that eliʹsha has done
5  just as he was relating to the king how he had restored the dead one to life the woman whose son he had restored to life came to the king appealing for her house and her field
at once gehaʹzi said my lord the king this is the woman and this is her son whom eliʹsha restored to life
6  at that the king asked the woman and she related the story to him
then the king assigned her a court official telling him return all that belongs to her and all the products of the field from the day she left the land until now
7  eliʹsha came to damascus when benhaʹdad the king of syria was sick
so the report was made to him the man of the true god has come here
8  at that the king said to hazʹael take a gift with you and go and meet the man of the true god
inquire of jehovah through him asking will i recover from this sickness
9  hazʹael went to meet him and took a gift with him every sort of good thing of damascus the load of 40 camels
he came and stood before him and said your son benhaʹdad the king of syria has sent me to you asking will i recover from this sickness
10  eliʹsha replied to him go and tell him you will certainly recover but jehovah has shown me that he will certainly die
11  and he kept staring at him to the point of embarrassment
then the man of the true god gave way to weeping
12  hazʹael asked why is my lord weeping he replied because i know what harm you will do to the people of israel
their fortified places you will set on fire their choice men you will kill with the sword their children you will dash to pieces and their pregnant women you will rip open
13  hazʹael said how could your servant who is a mere dog do such a deed but eliʹsha said jehovah has shown me that you will be king over syria
14  then he left eliʹsha and returned to his own lord who said to him what did eliʹsha say to you he replied he told me that you will certainly recover
15  but the next day hazʹael took a coverlet dipped it in water and held it over his face until he died
and hazʹael became king in his place
16  in the fifth year of jehoʹram the son of aʹhab the king of israel while jehoshʹaphat was king of judah jehoʹram the son of king jehoshʹaphat of judah became king
17  he was 32 years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in jerusalem
18  he walked in the way of the kings of israel just as those of the house of aʹhab had done for aʹhabs daughter had become his wife and he kept doing what was bad in jehovahs eyes
19  but jehovah did not want to bring judah to ruin for the sake of david his servant since he had promised him to give a lamp to him and to his sons always
20  in his days eʹdom revolted against judah and then set up its own king
21  so jehoʹram crossed over to zaʹir with all his chariots and he rose up by night and defeated the eʹdomites who were surrounding him and the chariot commanders and the troops fled to their tents
22  but eʹdom has kept up its revolt against judah to this day
libʹnah also revolted at that time
23  and the rest of the history of jehoʹram all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
24  then jehoʹram was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the city of david
and his son ahaziʹah became king in his place
25  in the 12th year of jehoʹram the son of aʹhab the king of israel ahaziʹah the son of king jehoʹram of judah became king
26  ahaziʹah was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in jerusalem
his mothers name was athaliʹah the granddaughter of king omʹri of israel
27  he walked in the way of the house of aʹhab and kept doing what was bad in jehovahs eyes like the house of aʹhab for he was related to the house of aʹhab by marriage
28  so he went with jehoʹram the son of aʹhab to wage war against king hazʹael of syria at raʹmothgilʹead but the syrians wounded jehoʹram
29  so king jehoʹram returned to jezʹreel to recover from the wounds that the syrians had inflicted on him at raʹmah when he fought against king hazʹael of syria
ahaziʹah the son of jehoʹram the king of judah went down to jezʹreel to see jehoʹram the son of aʹhab because he had been wounded
16  in the 17th year of peʹkah the son of remaliʹah aʹhaz the son of king joʹtham of judah became king
2  aʹhaz was 20 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in jerusalem
he did not do what was right in the eyes of jehovah his god as david his forefather had done
3  instead he walked in the way of the kings of israel and he even made his own son pass through the fire following the detestable practices of the nations that jehovah had driven out from before the israelites
4  he also kept sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places on the hills and under every luxuriant tree
5  it was then that king reʹzin of syria and peʹkah son of remaliʹah the king of israel came up to wage war against jerusalem
they laid siege against aʹhaz but were not able to capture the city
6  at that time king reʹzin of syria restored eʹlath to eʹdom after which he drove the jews out of eʹlath
and the eʹdomites entered eʹlath and they have occupied it down to this day
7  so aʹhaz sent messengers to king tigʹlathpileʹser of assyrʹia saying i am your servant and your son
come up and save me from the hand of the king of syria and the hand of the king of israel who are attacking me
8  aʹhaz then took the silver and the gold that was to be found at the house of jehovah and in the treasuries of the kings house and sent the king of assyrʹia a bribe
9  the king of assyrʹia responded to his request and he went up to damascus and captured it and led its people into exile to kir and he put reʹzin to death
10  then king aʹhaz went to meet king tigʹlathpileʹser of assyrʹia at damascus
when he saw the altar that was in damascus king aʹhaz sent uriʹjah the priest a plan of the altar showing its pattern and how it was made
11  uriʹjah the priest built an altar according to all the directions that king aʹhaz had sent from damascus
uriʹjah the priest finished building it before king aʹhaz returned from damascus
12  when the king returned from damascus and saw the altar he approached the altar and made offerings on it
13  and on that altar he continued to make his burnt offerings and his grain offerings smoke he also poured out his drink offerings and sprinkled the blood of his communion sacrifices on it
14  then he moved the copper altar that was before jehovah from its place in front of the house from between his own altar and the house of jehovah and he put it at the north side of his own altar
15  king aʹhaz commanded uriʹjah the priest make the morning burnt offering smoke on the great altar also the evening grain offering the kings burnt offering and his grain offering as well as the burnt offerings the grain offerings and the drink offerings of all the people
you should also sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offerings and all the blood of the other sacrifices
as for the copper altar let me decide what to do with it
16  and uriʹjah the priest did everything that king aʹhaz had commanded
17  furthermore king aʹhaz cut the side panels of the carriages into pieces and removed the basins from them and he took the sea down off the copper bulls that supported it and put it on a stone pavement
18  and the covered structure for the sabbath that had been built in the house and the kings outer entryway he shifted away from the house of jehovah he did so because of the king of assyrʹia
19  as for the rest of the history of aʹhaz what he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
20  then aʹhaz was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the city of david and his son hezekiʹah became king in his place
18  in the third year of hosheʹa the son of eʹlah the king of israel hezekiʹah the son of king aʹhaz of judah became king
2  he was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 29 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was aʹbi the daughter of zechariʹah
3  he kept doing what was right in jehovahs eyes just as david his forefather had done
4  he was the one who removed the high places smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred pole
he also crushed the copper serpent that moses had made for down to that time the people of israel had been making sacrificial smoke to it and it used to be called the copper serpentidol
5  he trusted in jehovah the god of israel there was no one like him among all the kings of judah after him nor among those prior to him
6  he held fast to jehovah
he did not turn away from following him he continued to keep the commandments that jehovah had given to moses
7  and jehovah was with him
wherever he went he acted wisely
he rebelled against the king of assyrʹia and refused to serve him
8  he also defeated the philisʹtines clear to gazʹa and its territories from watchtower to fortified city
9  in the fourth year of king hezekiʹah that is the seventh year of hosheʹa the son of eʹlah the king of israel king shalmaneʹser of assyrʹia came up against samarʹia and began to lay siege to it
10  they captured it at the end of three years in the sixth year of hezekiʹah which was the ninth year of king hosheʹa of israel samarʹia was captured
11  then the king of assyrʹia took israel into exile in assyrʹia and settled them in haʹlah and in haʹbor at the river goʹzan and in the cities of the medes
12  this was because they had not listened to the voice of jehovah their god but kept violating his covenant all that moses the servant of jehovah had commanded
they neither listened nor obeyed
13  in the 14th year of king hezekiʹah sennachʹerib the king of assyrʹia came up against all the fortified cities of judah and captured them
14  so king hezekiʹah of judah sent word to the king of assyrʹia at laʹchish i am at fault
withdraw from against me and i will give whatever you may impose on me
the king of assyrʹia imposed on king hezekiʹah of judah a fine of 300 silver talents and 30 gold talents
15  so hezekiʹah gave all the silver that could be found at the house of jehovah and in the treasuries of the kings house
16  at that time hezekiʹah removed the doors of the temple of jehovah and the doorposts that king hezekiʹah of judah himself had overlaid and he gave them to the king of assyrʹia
17  the king of assyrʹia then sent the tarʹtan the rabʹsaris and the rabʹshakeh with a vast army from laʹchish to king hezekiʹah in jerusalem
they went up to jerusalem and took up a position by the conduit of the upper pool which is at the highway of the laundrymans field
18  when they called for the king to come out eliʹakim son of hilkiʹah who was in charge of the household shebʹnah the secretary and joʹah son of aʹsaph the recorder came out to them
19  so the rabʹshakeh said to them please say to hezekiʹah this is what the great king the king of assyrʹia says what is the basis for your confidence
20  you are saying i have a strategy and the power to wage war but these are empty words
in whom have you put your trust so that you dare to rebel against me
21  look you trust in the support of this crushed reed egypt which if a man should lean on it would enter into his palm and pierce it
that is the way pharʹaoh king of egypt is to all those who trust in him
22  and if you should say to me we trust in jehovah our god is he not the one whose high places and altars hezekiʹah has removed while he says to judah and jerusalem you should bow down before this altar in jerusalem
23  so now make this wager please with my lord the king of assyrʹia i will give you 2000 horses if you are able to find enough riders for them
24  how then could you drive back even one governor who is the least of my lords servants while you put your trust in egypt for chariots and for horsemen
25  now is it without authorization from jehovah that i have come up against this place to destroy it jehovah himself said to me go up against this land and destroy it
26  at this eliʹakim son of hilkiʹah and shebʹnah and joʹah said to the rabʹshakeh speak to your servants please in the aramaʹic language for we can understand it do not speak to us in the language of the jews in the hearing of the people on the wall
27  but the rabʹshakeh said to them is it just to your lord and to you that my lord sent me to speak these words is it not also to the men who sit on the wall those who will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you
28  then the rabʹshakeh stood and called out loudly in the language of the jews saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyrʹia
29  this is what the king says do not let hezekiʹah deceive you for he is not able to rescue you out of my hand
30  and do not let hezekiʹah cause you to trust in jehovah by saying jehovah will surely rescue us and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of assyrʹia
31  do not listen to hezekiʹah for this is what the king of assyrʹia says make peace with me and surrender and each of you will eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree and will drink the water of his own cistern
32  until i come and take you to a land like your own land a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of olive trees and honey
then you will live and not die
do not listen to hezekiʹah for he misleads you by saying jehovah will rescue us
33  have any of the gods of the nations rescued their land out of the hand of the king of assyrʹia
34  where are the gods of haʹmath and arʹpad where are the gods of sepharvaʹim heʹna and ivʹvah have they rescued samarʹia out of my hand
35  who among all the gods of the lands have rescued their land out of my hand so that jehovah should rescue jerusalem out of my hand
36  but the people kept silent and did not say a word to him in reply for the order of the king was you must not answer him
37  but eliʹakim son of hilkiʹah who was in charge of the household shebʹnah the secretary and joʹah son of aʹsaph the recorder came to hezekiʹah with their garments ripped apart and told him the words of the rabʹshakeh
17  in the 12th year of king aʹhaz of judah hosheʹa the son of eʹlah became king over israel in samarʹia he ruled for nine years
2  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes only not to the extent of the kings of israel prior to him
3  king shalmaneʹser of assyrʹia came up against him and hosheʹa became his servant and began to pay tribute to him
4  however the king of assyrʹia learned that hosheʹa was involved in a conspiracy for he had sent messengers to king so of egypt and did not bring the tribute up to the king of assyrʹia as in former years
therefore the king of assyrʹia kept him confined and bound in prison
5  the king of assyrʹia invaded the entire land and he came to samarʹia and laid siege to it for three years
6  in the ninth year of hosheʹa the king of assyrʹia captured samarʹia
he then led the people of israel into exile in assyrʹia and made them dwell in haʹlah and in haʹbor at the river goʹzan and in the cities of the medes
7  this happened because the people of israel had sinned against jehovah their god who brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the control of pharʹaoh king of egypt
they worshipped other gods
8  they followed the customs of the nations that jehovah had driven out from before the israelites and they followed the customs that the kings of israel had established
9  the israelites were pursuing the things that were not right according to jehovah their god
they kept building high places in all their cities from watchtower to fortified city
10  they kept setting up for themselves sacred pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree
11  and on all the high places they would make sacrificial smoke just as the nations did that jehovah had driven into exile from before them
they kept doing wicked things to offend jehovah
12  they continued to serve disgusting idols about which jehovah had told them you must not do this
13  jehovah kept warning israel and judah through all his prophets and every visionary saying turn back from your wicked ways keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law that i commanded your forefathers and that i sent to you through my servants the prophets
14  but they did not listen and they remained just as stubborn as their forefathers who had not shown faith in jehovah their god
15  they continued rejecting his regulations and his covenant that he had made with their forefathers and his reminders that he had given to warn them and they kept following worthless idols and became worthless themselves imitating the nations all around them that jehovah had commanded them not to imitate
16  they kept leaving all the commandments of jehovah their god and they made metal statues of two calves and a sacred pole and they bowed down to all the army of the heavens and served baʹal
17  they also made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire they practiced divination and looked for omens and they kept devoting themselves to do what was bad in the eyes of jehovah to offend him
18  so jehovah was very angry with israel so that he removed them from his sight
he did not let any remain but the tribe of judah alone
19  even judah did not keep the commandments of jehovah their god they also walked in the customs that israel followed
20  jehovah rejected all the descendants of israel and humiliated them and gave them into the hand of plunderers until he had cast them away from before him
21  he ripped israel away from the house of david and they made jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat king
but jeroboʹam caused israel to stray from following jehovah and he caused them to commit a great sin
22  and the people of israel kept walking in all the sins that jeroboʹam had committed
they did not depart from them
23  until jehovah removed israel from his sight just as he had declared through all his servants the prophets
so israel was taken into exile from its land to assyrʹia where they remain to this day
24  the king of assyrʹia then brought people from babylon cuʹthah avʹva haʹmath and sepharvaʹim and settled them in the cities of samarʹia in place of the israelites they took possession of samarʹia and lived in its cities
25  when they first began dwelling there they did not fear jehovah
so jehovah sent lions among them and they killed some of the people
26  it was reported to the king of assyrʹia the nations that you have taken into exile and resettled in the cities of samarʹia do not know the religion of the god of the land
so he keeps sending lions among them which are putting them to death because none of them know the religion of the god of the land
27  at that the king of assyrʹia commanded have one of the priests whom you took into exile from there return to live there and to teach them the religion of the god of the land
28  so one of the priests whom they had taken into exile from samarʹia came back to live in bethʹel and he began to teach them how they should fear jehovah
29  however each different nation made their own god which they placed in the houses of worship on the high places that the samarʹitans had made each different nation did so in their cities where they were living
30  so the men of babylon made sucʹcothbeʹnoth the men of cuth made nerʹgal the men of haʹmath made ashiʹma
31  and the avʹvites made nibʹhaz and tarʹtak
the seʹpharvites would burn their sons in the fire to adramʹmelech and anamʹmelech the gods of sepharvaʹim
32  although they feared jehovah they appointed priests for the high places from the people in general and these officiated for them at the houses of worship on the high places
33  thus they feared jehovah but they worshipped their own gods according to the religion of the nations from which they had been deported
34  to this day they follow their former religions
none of them worship jehovah and none follow his statutes his judgments the law and the commandment that jehovah gave the sons of jacob whose name he changed to israel
35  when jehovah made a covenant with them he commanded them you must not fear other gods and you must not bow down to them or serve them or sacrifice to them
36  but jehovah who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and an outstretched arm is the one you should fear and to him you should bow down and to him you should sacrifice
37  and the regulations the judgments the law and the commandment that he wrote for you you should always follow carefully and you must not fear other gods
38  and you must not forget the covenant that i made with you and you must not fear other gods
39  but it is jehovah your god whom you should fear as he is the one who will rescue you out of the hand of all your enemies
40  but they did not obey and they followed their former religion
41  so these nations came to fear jehovah but they were also serving their own graven images
both their sons and their grandsons have done just as their forefathers did down to this day
9  eliʹsha the prophet then called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him wrap your garments around your waist and quickly take this flask of oil with you and go to raʹmothgilʹead
2  when you arrive there look for jeʹhu the son of jehoshʹaphat the son of nimʹshi go in and have him get up from among his brothers and take him into the innermost room
3  then take the flask of oil and pour it out on his head and say this is what jehovah says i anoint you as king over israel
then open the door and flee without delay
4  so the prophets attendant got on his way to raʹmothgilʹead
5  when he arrived the army chiefs were seated there
he said i have a message for you o chief
jeʹhu asked for which one of us he said for you o chief
6  so jeʹhu got up and went into the house the attendant poured the oil out on his head and said to him this is what jehovah the god of israel says i anoint you as king over jehovahs people over israel
7  you must strike down the house of aʹhab your lord and i will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and of all the servants of jehovah who died at the hands of jezʹebel
8  and the whole house of aʹhab will perish and i will annihilate from aʹhab every male including the helpless and weak in israel
9  and i will make the house of aʹhab like the house of jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat and like the house of baʹasha the son of ahiʹjah
10  as for jezʹebel the dogs will eat her up in the plot of land at jezʹreel and no one will bury her
with that he opened the door and fled
11  when jeʹhu went back to the servants of his lord they asked him is everything all right why did this crazy man come to you he answered them you know that sort of man and his sort of talk
12  but they said that is not true tell us please
then he said this is what he said to me and then he added this is what jehovah says i anoint you as king over israel
13  at this each of them quickly took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps and they blew the horn and said jeʹhu has become king
14  then jeʹhu the son of jehoshʹaphat the son of nimʹshi conspired against jehoʹram
jehoʹram had been on guard at raʹmothgilʹead he with all israel because of king hazʹael of syria
15  king jehoʹram later returned to jezʹreel to recover from the wounds that the syrians inflicted on him when he fought king hazʹael of syria
jeʹhu now said if you agree do not let anyone escape from the city to go and report this in jezʹreel
16  then jeʹhu mounted his chariot and went to jezʹreel for jehoʹram was lying there wounded and king ahaziʹah of judah had gone down to see jehoʹram
17  as the watchman was standing on the tower in jezʹreel he saw the throng of jeʹhus men approaching
at once he said i see a throng of men
jehoʹram said take a cavalryman and send him to meet them and let him say are you coming in peace
18  so a horseman went to meet him and said this is what the king says are you coming in peace but jeʹhu said what do you have to do with peace fall in behind me the watchman then reported the messenger reached them but he has not returned
19  so he sent out a second horseman who said when he came to them this is what the king says are you coming in peace but jeʹhu said what do you have to do with peace fall in behind me
20  the watchman then reported he reached them but he has not returned and the driving is like the driving of jeʹhu the grandson of nimʹshi for he drives like a madman
21  jehoʹram said hitch up so his war chariot was hitched up and king jehoʹram of israel and king ahaziʹah of judah each went out in his own war chariot to meet jeʹhu
they encountered him in the plot of land of naʹboth the jezʹreelite
22  as soon as jehoʹram saw jeʹhu he said are you coming in peace jeʹhu but he said what peace could there be as long as there is the prostitution of jezʹebel your mother and her many sorceries
23  at once jehoʹram turned his chariot to flee and he said to ahaziʹah we have been tricked ahaziʹah
24  jeʹhu took his bow in hand and shot jehoʹram between the shoulders and the arrow came out at his heart and he collapsed in his war chariot
25  he then said to bidʹkar his adjutant pick him up and throw him into the field of naʹboth the jezʹreelite
remember you and i were riding together behind aʹhab his father when jehovah himself made this pronouncement against him
26  as surely as i saw the blood of naʹboth and the blood of his sons yesterday declares jehovah i will repay you in this very plot of land declares jehovah
so now pick him up and throw him into the plot of land according to the word of jehovah
27  when king ahaziʹah of judah saw what was happening he fled by way of the garden house
later jeʹhu pursued him and said strike him down also so they struck him down in the chariot on his way up to gur which is by ibʹleam
but he continued his flight to megidʹdo and died there
28  then his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and they buried him in his grave with his forefathers in the city of david
29  it was in the 11th year of jehoʹram the son of aʹhab that ahaziʹah had become king over judah
30  when jeʹhu came to jezʹreel jezʹebel heard of it
so she painted her eyes with black paint and adorned her head and looked down through the window
31  as jeʹhu came in through the gate she said did it go well with zimʹri the killer of his lord
32  looking up to the window he said who is on my side who immediately two or three court officials looked down at him
33  he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses and he trampled her
34  after that he went in and ate and drank
he then said please take care of this accursed woman and bury her
after all she is the daughter of a king
35  but when they went to bury her they did not find anything but her skull and her feet and the palms of her hands
36  when they returned and told him he said this fulfills the word of jehovah that he spoke through his servant eliʹjah the tishʹbite saying in the plot of land of jezʹreel the dogs will eat the flesh of jezʹebel
37  and the dead body of jezʹebel will become as manure on the surface of the field in the plot of land of jezʹreel so that they may not say this is jezʹebel
7  eliʹsha now said listen to the word of jehovah
this is what jehovah says tomorrow about this time at the gate of samarʹia a seah measure of fine flour will be worth a shekel and two seah measures of barley will be worth a shekel
2  at that the adjutant whom the king relied on said to the man of the true god even if jehovah should open floodgates in the heavens could this possibly take place to that he said you will see it with your own eyes but you will not eat from it
3  there were four lepers at the entrance of the city gate and they said to one another why are we sitting here until we die
4  if we say let us go into the city while the famine is in the city we would die there
and if we sit here we will die anyway
so now let us go over to the camp of the syrians
if they spare our lives we will live but if they put us to death then we will die
5  they then got up in the evening darkness and entered the camp of the syrians
when they reached the outskirts of the syrian camp there was nobody there
6  for jehovah had caused the syrian camp to hear the sound of war chariots and horses the sound of a huge army
so they said to one another look the king of israel has hired the kings of the hitʹtites and the kings of egypt to come against us
7  they immediately got up and fled in the evening darkness leaving their tents horses donkeys and the whole camp just as it was and they fled for their lives
8  when these lepers reached the outskirts of the camp they entered into one of the tents and began to eat and drink
they carried away from there silver gold and garments and went and hid them
then they returned and entered another tent and carried things away from there and went and hid them
9  finally they said to one another what we are doing is not right
this day is a day of good news if we hesitate and wait until dawn we will deserve to be punished
let us now go and report this at the kings house
10  so they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city and reported to them we went into the camp of the syrians but nobody was therewe did not hear anyone at all
there were only the horses and donkeys tied and the tents left just as they were
11  at once the gatekeepers called out and it was reported inside the kings house
12  immediately the king got up by night and said to his servants please let me tell you what the syrians have done to us
they know that we are hungry so they left the camp to hide in the field saying they will come out of the city and we will catch them alive and enter into the city
13  then one of his servants said please let some men take five of the remaining horses that are in the city
look they will end up the same as all the crowd of israel that remain here
look they will end up the same as all the crowd of israel that perished
let us then send them out and see
14  so they took two chariots with horses and the king sent them out to the camp of the syrians saying go and see
15  they followed them as far as the jordan and the entire way was covered with garments and utensils that the syrians had thrown away as they fled in panic
the messengers returned and reported it to the king
16  the people then went out and plundered the camp of the syrians so that a seah measure of fine flour came to be worth a shekel and two seah measures of barley came to be worth a shekel according to the word of jehovah
17  the king had appointed the adjutant whom he relied on to be in charge of the gate but the people trampled him to death at the gate just as the man of the true god had told the king when he came down to him
18  it happened just as the man of the true god had said to the king two seah measures of barley will be worth a shekel and a seah measure of fine flour will be worth a shekel tomorrow at this time at the gate of samarʹia
19  but the adjutant had said to the man of the true god even if jehovah should open floodgates in the heavens could such a thing take place to this eliʹsha had said you will see it with your own eyes but you will not eat from it
20  that is exactly what happened to him because the people trampled him to death at the gate
23  so the king sent word and they summoned all the elders of judah and jerusalem
2  after that the king went up to the house of jehovah with all the men of judah all the inhabitants of jerusalem the priests and the prophetsall the people from small to great
he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of jehovah
3  the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before jehovah that he would follow jehovah and keep his commandments his reminders and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul by carrying out the words of this covenant that were written in this book
and all the people agreed to the covenant
4  the king then ordered hilkiʹah the high priest the priests of the second rank and the doorkeepers to bring out from the temple of jehovah all the utensils made for baʹal for the sacred pole and for all the army of the heavens
then he burned them outside jerusalem on the terraces of kidʹron and he took their ashes to bethʹel
5  so he put out of business the foreigngod priests whom the kings of judah had appointed to make sacrificial smoke on the high places in the cities of judah and the surroundings of jerusalem as well as those making sacrificial smoke to baʹal to the sun to the moon to the constellations of the zodiac and to all the army of the heavens
6  he brought the sacred pole out from the house of jehovah to the outskirts of jerusalem to the kidʹron valley and he burned it in the kidʹron valley and ground it to dust and scattered its dust on the graves of the common people
7  he also tore down the houses of the male temple prostitutes which were in the house of jehovah and where the women were weaving tent shrines for the sacred pole
8  then he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and he made unfit for worship the high places where the priests had been making sacrificial smoke from geʹba to beʹersheʹba
he also tore down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of joshua the chief of the city which were on the left as one entered the city gate
9  the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of jehovah in jerusalem but they did eat unleavened bread along with their brothers
10  he also made unfit for worship toʹpheth which is in the valley of the sons of hinʹnom so that no one could make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to moʹlech
11  and he prohibited the horses that the kings of judah had dedicated to the sun from entering the house of jehovah by the chamber of naʹthanmelʹech the court official which was in the porticoes and he burned the chariots of the sun in the fire
12  the king also tore down the altars that the kings of judah had set up on the roof of aʹhazs upper chamber as well as the altars that manasʹseh had set up in two courtyards of the house of jehovah
he crushed them and scattered their dust in the kidʹron valley
13  and the king made unfit for worship the high places in front of jerusalem that were to the south of the mount of ruination which solʹomon the king of israel had built to ashʹtoreth the disgusting goddess of the sidoʹnians and to cheʹmosh the disgusting god of moʹab and to milʹcom the detestable god of the amʹmonites
14  he broke the sacred pillars to pieces and cut down the sacred poles and filled their places with human bones
15  he also tore down the altar in bethʹel the high place that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had made that caused israel to sin
after tearing down that altar and the high place he burned the high place ground it to dust and burned the sacred pole
16  when josiʹah turned and saw the graves on the mountain he had the bones taken from the graves and burned them on the altar making it unfit for worship according to jehovahs word that had been proclaimed by the man of the true god who foretold that these things would happen
17  then he said what is the gravestone over there that i am looking at at this the men of the city said to him it is the grave of the man of the true god from judah who foretold these things that you have done against the altar of bethʹel
18  so he said let him rest
do not let anyone disturb his bones
so they left his bones undisturbed as well as the bones of the prophet who had come from samarʹia
19  josiʹah also removed all the houses of worship on the high places that were in the cities of samarʹia which the kings of israel had built to offend god and he did the same thing to them that he had done at bethʹel
20  so he sacrificed on the altars all the priests of the high places who were there and he burned human bones on them
after that he returned to jerusalem
21  the king now commanded all the people hold a passover to jehovah your god as is written in this book of the covenant
22  no passover like this had been held since the days when the judges had judged israel or in all the days of the kings of israel and the kings of judah
23  but in the 18th year of king josiʹah this passover to jehovah was held in jerusalem
24  josiʹah also cleared out the spirit mediums the fortunetellers the teraphim statues the disgusting idols and all the disgusting things that had appeared in the land of judah and in jerusalem in order to carry out the words of the law that were written in the book that hilkiʹah the priest had found in the house of jehovah
25  there was no king like him prior to him who returned to jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength according to all the law of moses nor did anyone like him rise up after him
26  nevertheless jehovah did not turn away from his burning anger that blazed against judah because of all the offensive things that manasʹseh had done to offend him
27  jehovah said i will also remove judah from my sight just as i removed israel and i will reject this city that i chose jerusalem and the house about which i said my name will continue there
28  as for the rest of the history of josiʹah all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
29  in his days pharʹaoh neʹchoh the king of egypt came to meet the king of assyrʹia by the euphraʹtes river and king josiʹah went out to confront him but when neʹchoh saw him he put him to death at megidʹdo
30  so his servants transported his dead body in a chariot from megidʹdo and brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his grave
then the people of the land took josiʹahs son jehoʹahaz and anointed him and made him king in place of his father
31  jehoʹahaz was 23 years old when he became king and he reigned for three months in jerusalem
his mothers name was hamuʹtal the daughter of jeremiah from libʹnah
32  he began to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes according to all that his forefathers had done
33  pharʹaoh neʹchoh imprisoned him at ribʹlah in the land of haʹmath to keep him from reigning in jerusalem and then imposed on the land a fine of 100 silver talents and a gold talent
34  furthermore pharʹaoh neʹchoh made josiʹahs son eliʹakim king in place of his father josiʹah and changed his name to jehoiʹakim but he took jehoʹahaz and brought him to egypt where he eventually died
35  jehoiʹakim gave the silver and the gold to pharʹaoh but he had to tax the land to give the silver that pharʹaoh demanded
he exacted an assessed amount of silver and gold from each of the people of the land to give to pharʹaoh neʹchoh
36  jehoiʹakim was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was zebiʹdah the daughter of pedaiʹah from ruʹmah
37  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes according to all that his forefathers had done
22  josiʹah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned for 31 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was jediʹdah the daughter of adaiʹah from bozʹkath
2  he did what was right in jehovahs eyes and walked in all the ways of david his forefather and he did not deviate to the right or to the left
3  in the 18th year of king josiʹah the king sent shaʹphan the secretary the son of azaliʹah the son of meshulʹlam to the house of jehovah saying
4  go up to hilkiʹah the high priest and let him collect all the money that is being brought into the house of jehovah which the doorkeepers have collected from the people
5  have them give it to those appointed over the work in the house of jehovah who in turn will give it to the workers in the house of jehovah who are to repair the damage to the house
6  that is to the craftsmen the builders and the masons and they are to use it to buy timbers and hewn stones to repair the house
7  but no accounting should be required of them for the money that they are given because they are trustworthy
8  later hilkiʹah the high priest said to shaʹphan the secretary i have found the book of the law in the house of jehovah
so hilkiʹah gave the book to shaʹphan who began to read it
9  then shaʹphan the secretary went to the king and told him your servants have poured out the money that was found in the house and they have handed it over to those appointed over the work in the house of jehovah
10  shaʹphan the secretary also told the king there is a book that hilkiʹah the priest has given me
then shaʹphan began to read it before the king
11  as soon as the king heard the words of the book of the law he ripped his garments apart
12  then the king gave this order to hilkiʹah the priest ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan achʹbor the son of micaiʹah shaʹphan the secretary and asaiʹah the kings servant
13  go inquire of jehovah in my behalf in behalf of the people and in behalf of all judah concerning the words of this book that has been found for jehovahs rage that has been set ablaze against us is great because our forefathers did not obey the words of this book by observing all that is written concerning us
14  so hilkiʹah the priest ahiʹkam achʹbor shaʹphan and asaiʹah went to hulʹdah the prophetess
she was the wife of shalʹlum son of tikʹvah son of harʹhas the caretaker of the wardrobe and she was dwelling in the second quarter of jerusalem and they spoke to her there
15  she said to them this is what jehovah the god of israel says tell the man who sent you to me
16  this is what jehovah says i will bring calamity on this place and its inhabitants all the words of the book that the king of judah has read
17  because they have abandoned me and are making sacrifices smoke to other gods in order to offend me with all the work of their hands my rage will be set ablaze against this place and it will not be extinguished
18  but to the king of judah who sent you to inquire of jehovah this is what you should say to him this is what jehovah the god of israel says regarding the words that you have heard
19  because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before jehovah on hearing what i have spoken against this place and its inhabitantsthat they would become an object of horror and a curseand you ripped your garments apart and wept before me i also have heard you declares jehovah
20  that is why i will gather you to your ancestors and you will be laid in your grave in peace and your eyes will not see all the calamity that i will bring on this place
then they brought the reply to the king
6  the sons of the prophets said to eliʹsha look the place where we are staying with you is too cramped for us
2  please let us go to the jordan
let each of us take a log from there and make a place there where we can dwell
he said go
3  one of them said will you please come along with your servants at that he said i will come
4  so he went with them and they came to the jordan and began to cut down the trees
5  as one of them was cutting down a tree the axhead fell into the water and he cried out alas my master it was borrowed
6  the man of the true god said where did it fall so he showed him the place
he then cut off a piece of wood and threw it there and made the axhead float
7  he said lift it out
so he reached out his hand and took it
8  now the king of syria went to war against israel
he consulted with his servants and said i will encamp at such and such a place with you
9  then the man of the true god sent word to the king of israel saying beware of passing by this place because that is where the syrians are coming down
10  so the king of israel sent word to the place that the man of the true god had warned him about
he kept warning him and he stayed away from there on several occasions
11  this enraged the king of syria so he summoned his servants and said to them tell me who among us is on the side of the king of israel
12  then one of his servants said none of us my lord the king it is eliʹsha the prophet in israel who tells the king of israel the things that you say in your own bedroom
13  he said go and find out where he is so that i may send men to capture him
later the report was made to him he is in doʹthan
14  he immediately sent horses and war chariots there as well as a large army they came by night and surrounded the city
15  when the attendant of the man of the true god rose early and went outside he saw that an army with horses and war chariots was surrounding the city
at once the attendant said to him alas my master what are we to do
16  but he said do not be afraid for there are more who are with us than those who are with them
17  then eliʹsha began to pray and say o jehovah open his eyes please that he may see
immediately jehovah opened the attendants eyes and he saw and look the mountainous region was full of horses and war chariots of fire all around eliʹsha
18  when the syrians came down to him eliʹsha prayed to jehovah and said please strike this nation with blindness
so he struck them with blindness just as eliʹsha had requested
19  eliʹsha now said to them this is not the way and this is not the city
follow me and let me lead you to the man you are looking for
however he led them to samarʹia
20  when they arrived in samarʹia eliʹsha said o jehovah open their eyes so that they may see
so jehovah opened their eyes and they saw that they were in the middle of samarʹia
21  when the king of israel saw them he said to eliʹsha should i strike them down should i strike them down my father
22  but he said you must not strike them down
do you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow give them bread and water so they may eat and drink and return to their lord
23  so he spread a great feast for them and they ate and drank after which he sent them away to return to their lord
and not once did the marauder bands of the syrians come again into the land of israel
24  afterward benhaʹdad the king of syria gathered all his army together and went up and besieged samarʹia
25  so there was a great famine in samarʹia and they besieged it until a donkeys head was worth 80 silver pieces and a fourth of a cab measure of doves droppings was worth 5 silver pieces
26  as the king of israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried out to him help us o my lord the king
27  to this he said if jehovah does not help you where can i get help for you from the threshing floor or from the wine or oil press
28  the king asked her what is the matter with you she replied this woman said to me hand over your son and we will eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow
29  so we boiled my son and ate him
the next day i said to her hand over your son so that we may eat him
but she hid her son
30  as soon as the king heard the womans words he ripped his garments apart
when he passed by on the wall the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes
31  then he said so may god do to me and add to it if the head of eliʹsha the son of shaʹphat remains on him today
32  eliʹsha was sitting in his house and the elders were sitting with him
the king sent a man ahead of him but before the messenger arrived eliʹsha said to the elders have you seen how this son of a murderer has sent to take off my head watch when the messenger comes close the door and hold the door shut against him
is not the sound of his lords footsteps behind him
33  while he was still speaking with them the messenger came to him and the king said this calamity is from jehovah
why should i wait any longer for jehovah
21  manasʹseh was 12 years old when he became king and he reigned for 55 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was hephʹzibah
2  he did what was bad in jehovahs eyes following the detestable practices of the nations that jehovah had driven out from before the people of israel
3  he rebuilt the high places that his father hezekiʹah had destroyed and he set up altars to baʹal and made a sacred pole just as aʹhab the king of israel had done
and he bowed down to all the army of the heavens and served them
4  he also built altars in the house of jehovah about which jehovah had said in jerusalem i will put my name
5  and he built altars to all the army of the heavens in two courtyards of the house of jehovah
6  and he made his own son pass through the fire he practiced magic looked for omens and appointed spirit mediums and fortunetellers
he did on a grand scale what was bad in jehovahs eyes to offend him
7  he put the carved image of the sacred pole that he made into the house about which jehovah had said to david and to his son solʹomon in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel i will permanently put my name
8  and i will never again make the feet of israel wander from the land that i gave to their forefathers provided they carefully observe all that i have commanded them the entire law that my servant moses ordered them to follow
9  but they did not obey and manasʹseh kept leading them astray causing them to do greater evil than the nations that jehovah had annihilated from before the israelites
10  jehovah kept speaking through his servants the prophets saying
11  manasʹseh the king of judah has done all these detestable things he has acted more wickedly than all the amʹorites before him and he has made judah sin with his disgusting idols
12  therefore this is what jehovah the god of israel says here i am bringing such a disaster on jerusalem and judah that it will make both ears of anyone who hears about it tingle
13  and i will stretch out on jerusalem the measuring line applied to samarʹia and use the leveling tool applied to the house of aʹhab and i will wipe jerusalem clean just as one wipes a bowl clean wiping it and turning it upside down
14  i will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies and they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies
15  because they did what was bad in my eyes and were continually offending me from the day that their forefathers came out of egypt to this day
16  manasʹseh also shed innocent blood in very great quantity until he had filled jerusalem from one end to the other besides his sin of causing judah to sin by doing what was bad in the eyes of jehovah
17  as for the rest of the history of manasʹseh and all that he did and the sins that he committed are they not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
18  then manasʹseh was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the garden of his house in the garden of uzʹza and his son aʹmon became king in his place
19  aʹmon was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned for two years in jerusalem
his mothers name was meshulʹlemeth the daughter of haʹruz from jotʹbah
20  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes just as his father manasʹseh had done
21  he kept walking in all the ways that his father walked and he continued serving and bowing down to the disgusting idols that his father had served
22  so he abandoned jehovah the god of his forefathers and he did not walk in the way of jehovah
23  eventually aʹmons servants conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house
24  but the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against king aʹmon and they made his son josiʹah king in his place
25  as for the rest of the history of aʹmon what he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
26  so they buried him in his grave in the garden of uzʹza and his son josiʹah became king in his place
25  in the ninth year of zedekiʹahs reign in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon came with all his army against jerusalem
he camped against it and built a siege wall all around it
2  and the city was under siege until the 11th year of king zedekiʹah
3  on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city and there was no food for the people of the land
4  the city wall was broken through and all the soldiers fled by night through the gate between the double wall near the kings garden while the chaldeʹans were surrounding the city and the king went by the way of the arʹabah
5  but the chaldeʹan army pursued the king and they overtook him in the desert plains of jerʹicho and all his troops were scattered from his side
6  then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of babylon at ribʹlah and they passed sentence on him
7  they slaughtered zedekiʹahs sons before his eyes then nebuchadnezʹzar blinded zedekiʹahs eyes bound him with copper fetters and brought him to babylon
8  in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month that is in the 19th year of king nebuchadnezʹzar the king of babylon nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard the servant of the king of babylon came to jerusalem
9  he burned down the house of jehovah the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem he also burned down the house of every prominent man
10  and the walls surrounding jerusalem were pulled down by the entire chaldeʹan army that was with the chief of the guard
11  nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard took into exile the rest of the people who were left in the city the deserters who had gone over to the king of babylon and the rest of the population
12  but the chief of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to serve as vinedressers and as compulsory laborers
13  and the chaldeʹans broke into pieces the copper pillars of the house of jehovah and the carriages and the copper sea that were in the house of jehovah and they carried the copper away to babylon
14  they also took the cans the shovels the extinguishers the cups and all the copper utensils used in the temple service
15  the chief of the guard took the fire holders and the bowls that were of genuine gold and silver
16  as for the two pillars the sea and the carriages that solʹomon had made for the house of jehovah the copper of all these articles was beyond weighing
17  each pillar was 18 cubits high and the capital on it was of copper and the height of the capital was three cubits and the network and pomegranates all around on the capital were all made of copper
the second pillar with its network was like it
18  the chief of the guard also took seraiʹah the chief priest zephaniʹah the second priest and the three doorkeepers
19  and he took from the city one court official who was the commissioner over the soldiers five close associates of the king who were found in the city as well as the secretary of the chief of the army the one mustering the people of the land and 60 men of the common people of the land who were yet found in the city
20  nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard took them and brought them to the king of babylon at ribʹlah
21  the king of babylon struck them down and put them to death at ribʹlah in the land of haʹmath
thus judah went into exile from its land
22  king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon appointed gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan over the people whom he had left behind in the land of judah
23  when all the army chiefs and their men heard that the king of babylon had appointed gedaliʹah they immediately came to gedaliʹah at mizʹpah
they were ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah johaʹnan the son of kareʹah seraiʹah the son of tanhuʹmeth the netophʹathite and jaazaniʹah the son of the maacʹathite together with their men
24  gedaliʹah swore an oath to them and their men and said to them do not be afraid of being servants to the chaldeʹans
live in the land and serve the king of babylon and it will go well with you
25  and in the seventh month ishʹmael son of nethaniʹah son of elishʹama who was of the royal line came with ten other men and they struck down gedaliʹah and he died along with the jews and the chaldeʹans who were with him in mizʹpah
26  after that all the people from small to great including the army chiefs rose up and went to egypt for they were afraid of the chaldeʹans
27  and in the 37th year of the exile of king jehoiʹachin of judah in the 12th month on the 27th day of the month king eʹvilmerʹodach of babylon in the year he became king released king jehoiʹachin of judah from prison
28  he spoke kindly with him and put his throne higher than the thrones of the other kings who were with him in babylon
29  so jehoiʹachin took off his prison garments and he regularly ate before him all the days of his life
30  a regular allowance of food was given him from the king day after day all the days of his life
13  in the 23rd year of jehoʹash the son of ahaziʹah the king of judah jehoʹahaz the son of jeʹhu became king over israel in samarʹia and he reigned for 17 years
2  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes and he persisted in the sin that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had caused israel to commit
he did not turn away from it
3  so jehovahs anger grew hot against israel and he gave them into the hand of king hazʹael of syria and into the hand of benhaʹdad the son of hazʹael all their days
4  in time jehoʹahaz begged for the favor of jehovah and jehovah listened to him for he had seen the oppression the king of syria had inflicted on israel
5  so jehovah provided israel with a savior to free them from syrias grip and the israelites were able to dwell in their homes as before
6  however they did not depart from the sin of the house of jeroboʹam that he had caused israel to commit
they continued in this sin and the sacred pole continued to stand in samarʹia
7  jehoʹahaz was left with an army of only 50 horsemen 10 chariots and 10000 foot soldiers because the king of syria had destroyed them trampling them like the dust at threshing time
8  as for the rest of the history of jehoʹahaz all that he did and his mightiness is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
9  then jehoʹahaz was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in samarʹia and his son jehoʹash became king in his place
10  in the 37th year of king jehoʹash of judah jehoʹash the son of jehoʹahaz became king over israel in samarʹia and he reigned for 16 years
11  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes not departing from all the sins that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had made israel commit
he continued in these sins
12  as for the rest of the history of jehoʹash all that he did and his mightiness and how he fought against king amaziʹah of judah is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
13  then jehoʹash was laid to rest with his forefathers and jeroboʹam sat on his throne
and jehoʹash was buried in samarʹia with the kings of israel
14  now when eliʹsha became ill with the sickness from which he eventually died jehoʹash the king of israel came down to him and wept over him saying my father my father the chariot of israel and his horsemen
15  eliʹsha then said to him take a bow and arrows
so he took a bow and arrows
16  then he said to the king of israel put your hand to the bow
so he put his hand to it after which eliʹsha laid his hands on the kings hands
17  then he said open the window toward the east
so he opened it
eliʹsha said shoot so he shot
he now said jehovahs arrow of victory the arrow of victory over syria you will strike down syria at aʹphek until you finish it off
18  he continued take the arrows and he took them
then he said to the king of israel strike the ground
so he struck the ground three times and stopped
19  at that the man of the true god grew indignant at him and said you should have struck the ground five or six times then you would have struck down syria until you finished it off but now you will strike down syria only three times
20  after that eliʹsha died and was buried
there were moʹabite marauder bands that would come into the land at the beginning of the year
21  as some men were burying a man they saw the marauder band so they quickly threw the man into eliʹshas burial place and ran off
when the man touched the bones of eliʹsha he came to life and stood on his feet
22  now king hazʹael of syria oppressed israel all the days of jehoʹahaz
23  however jehovah extended favor and mercy to them and showed his concern for them for the sake of his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob
he did not want to bring them to ruin and he has not cast them away from his presence to this day
24  when king hazʹael of syria died his son benhaʹdad became king in his place
25  jehoʹash the son of jehoʹahaz then took back from benhaʹdad the son of hazʹael the cities that he had taken in war from jehoʹahaz his father
three times jehoʹash struck him down and he recovered the cities of israel
14  in the second year of jehoʹash the son of jehoʹahaz the king of israel amaziʹah the son of king jehoʹash of judah became king
2  he was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 29 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was jehoadʹdin of jerusalem
3  he continued to do what was right in jehovahs eyes but not like david his forefather
he did everything as jehoʹash his father had done
4  however the high places were not removed and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places
5  as soon as he had the kingdom firmly in his control he struck down his servants who had struck down his father the king
6  but he did not put the sons of the murderers to death in harmony with jehovahs commandment written in the book of moses law fathers should not be put to death for their sons and sons should not be put to death for their fathers but each one should be put to death for his own sin
7  he struck down the eʹdomites in the valley of salt 10000 men and captured seʹla in the war and its name became jokʹtheel to this day
8  then amaziʹah sent messengers to jehoʹash son of jehoʹahaz son of jeʹhu the king of israel saying come let us confront each other in battle
9  king jehoʹash of israel sent this message to king amaziʹah of judah the thorny weed in lebʹanon sent a message to the cedar in lebʹanon give your daughter to my son as a wife
however a wild beast of lebʹanon passed by and trampled down the thorny weed
10  true you have struck down eʹdom so your heart has become arrogant
enjoy your glory but stay in your own house
why should you provoke disaster and fall bringing judah down with you
11  but amaziʹah did not listen
so king jehoʹash of israel went up and he and king amaziʹah of judah confronted each other in battle at bethsheʹmesh which belongs to judah
12  judah was defeated by israel so each one fled to his home
13  king jehoʹash of israel captured king amaziʹah of judah son of jehoʹash son of ahaziʹah at bethsheʹmesh
then they came to jerusalem and he made a breach in the wall of jerusalem from the gate of eʹphraim to the corner gate 400 cubits
14  he took all the gold and the silver and all the articles that were found in the house of jehovah and in the treasuries of the house of the king as well as hostages
then he returned to samarʹia
15  as for the rest of the history of jehoʹash what he did and his mightiness and how he fought against king amaziʹah of judah is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
16  then jehoʹash was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in samarʹia with the kings of israel and his son jeroboʹam became king in his place
17  amaziʹah the son of jehoʹash the king of judah lived for 15 years after the death of jehoʹash the son of jehoʹahaz the king of israel
18  as for the rest of the history of amaziʹah is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
19  later a conspiracy was formed against him at jerusalem and he fled to laʹchish but they sent men after him to laʹchish and put him to death there
20  so they carried him back on horses and he was buried in jerusalem with his forefathers in the city of david
21  then all the people of judah took azariʹah who was 16 years old and made him king in place of his father amaziʹah
22  he rebuilt eʹlath and restored it to judah after the king was laid to rest with his forefathers
23  in the 15th year of amaziʹah the son of jehoʹash the king of judah jeroboʹam the son of king jehoʹash of israel became king in samarʹia and he reigned for 41 years
24  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes
he did not depart from all the sins that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had caused israel to commit
25  he restored the boundary of israel from leʹbohaʹmath clear to the sea of the arʹabah according to the word that jehovah the god of israel spoke through his servant joʹnah the son of amitʹtai the prophet from gathheʹpher
26  for jehovah had seen the very bitter affliction of israel
there was no one left to help israel not even the helpless or the weak
27  but jehovah had promised not to wipe out the name of israel from under the heavens
so he saved them by the hand of jeroboʹam the son of jehoʹash
28  as for the rest of the history of jeroboʹam all that he did and his mightiness how he fought and how he restored damascus and haʹmath to judah in israel is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
29  then jeroboʹam was laid to rest with his forefathers with the kings of israel and his son zechariʹah became king in his place
19  as soon as king hezekiʹah heard this he ripped his garments apart and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of jehovah
2  then he sent eliʹakim who was in charge of the household shebʹnah the secretary and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to the prophet isaiah the son of aʹmoz
3  they said to him this is what hezekiʹah says this day is a day of distress of rebuke and of disgrace for the children are ready to be born but there is no strength to give birth
4  perhaps jehovah your god will hear all the words of the rabʹshakeh whom the king of assyrʹia his lord sent to taunt the living god and he will call him to account for the words that jehovah your god has heard
so offer up a prayer in behalf of the remnant who have survived
5  so the servants of king hezekiʹah went in to isaiah
6  and isaiah said to them this is what you should say to your lord this is what jehovah says do not be afraid because of the words that you heard the words with which the attendants of the king of assyrʹia blasphemed me
7  here i am putting a thought in his mind and he will hear a report and return to his own land and i will make him fall by the sword in his own land
8  after the rabʹshakeh heard that the king of assyrʹia had pulled away from laʹchish he returned to him and found him fighting against libʹnah
9  now the king heard it said about king tirhaʹkah of ethioʹpia here he has come out to fight against you
so he sent messengers again to hezekiʹah saying
10  this is what you should say to king hezekiʹah of judah do not let your god in whom you trust deceive you by saying jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of assyrʹia
11  look you have heard what the kings of assyrʹia did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction
will you alone be rescued
12  did the gods of the nations that my forefathers destroyed rescue them where are goʹzan haʹran reʹzeph and the people of eʹden who were in telasʹsar
13  where is the king of haʹmath the king of arʹpad and the king of the cities of sepharvaʹim and of heʹna and of ivʹvah
14  hezekiʹah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them
hezekiʹah then went up to the house of jehovah and spread them out before jehovah
15  and hezekiʹah began to pray before jehovah and say o jehovah the god of israel sitting enthroned above the cherubs you alone are the true god of all the kingdoms of the earth
you made the heavens and the earth
16  incline your ear o jehovah and hear open your eyes o jehovah and see hear the words that sennachʹerib has sent to taunt the living god
17  it is a fact o jehovah that the kings of assyrʹia have devastated the nations and their lands
18  and they have thrown their gods into the fire because they were not gods but the work of human hands wood and stone
that is why they could destroy them
19  but now o jehovah our god please save us out of his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are god o jehovah
20  isaiah son of aʹmoz then sent this message to hezekiʹah this is what jehovah the god of israel says i have heard your prayer to me concerning king sennachʹerib of assyrʹia
21  this is the word that jehovah has spoken against him the virgin daughter of zion despises you she scoffs at you
the daughter of jerusalem shakes her head at you
22  whom have you taunted and blasphemed against whom have you raised your voiceand lifted your arrogant eyes it is against the holy one of israel
23  through your messengers you have taunted jehovah and saidwith the multitude of my war chariotsi will ascend the heights of mountainsthe remotest parts of lebʹanon
i will cut down its lofty cedars its choice juniper trees
i will enter its farthest retreats its densest forests
24  i will dig wells and drink foreign watersi will dry up all the streams of egypt with the soles of my feet
25  have you not heard from long ago it was determined
from days gone by i have prepared it
now i will bring it about
you will turn fortified cities into desolate piles of ruins
26  their inhabitants will be helplessthey will be terrified and put to shame
they will become as vegetation of the field and green grassas grass of the roofs that is scorched by the east wind
27  but i well know when you sit when you go out when you come inand when you are enraged against me
28  because your rage against me and your roaring have reached my ears
so i will put my hook in your nose and my bridle between your lipsand i will lead you back the way you came
29  and this will be the sign for you this year you will eat what grows on its own and in the second year you will eat grain that sprouts from that but in the third year you will sow seed and reap and you will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage
30  those of the house of judah who escape those who are left will take root downward and produce fruit upward
31  for a remnant will go out of jerusalem and survivors from mount zion
the zeal of jehovah of armies will do this
32  therefore this is what jehovah says about the king of assyrʹia he will not come into this cityor shoot an arrow thereor confront it with a shieldor cast up a siege rampart against it
33  by the way he came he will returnhe will not come into this city declares jehovah
34  i will defend this city and save it for my own sakeand for the sake of my servant david
35  on that very night the angel of jehovah went out and struck down 185000 men in the camp of the assyrʹians
when people rose up early in the morning they saw all the dead bodies
36  so king sennachʹerib of assyrʹia departed and returned to ninʹeveh and stayed there
37  and as he was bowing down at the house of his god nisʹroch his own sons adramʹmelech and shareʹzer struck him down with the sword and then escaped to the land of arʹarat
and his son eʹsarhadʹdon became king in his place
24  in jehoiʹakims days king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon came against him and jehoiʹakim became his servant for three years
however he turned against him and rebelled
2  then jehovah began to send against him marauder bands of chaldeʹans syrians moʹabites and amʹmonites
he kept sending them against judah to destroy it according to jehovahs word that he had spoken through his servants the prophets
3  surely it was by the order of jehovah that this happened to judah to remove them from his sight because of all the sins that manasʹseh had committed
4  and also the innocent blood that he had shed for he had filled jerusalem with innocent blood and jehovah was not willing to forgive
5  as for the rest of the history of jehoiʹakim all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
6  then jehoiʹakim was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son jehoiʹachin became king in his place
7  never again did the king of egypt venture out of his land for the king of babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of egypt from the wadi of egypt up to the euphraʹtes river
8  jehoiʹachin was 18 years old when he became king and he reigned for three months in jerusalem
his mothers name was nehushʹta the daughter of elnaʹthan of jerusalem
9  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes according to all that his father had done
10  during that time the servants of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon came up against jerusalem and the city came under siege
11  king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon came to the city while his servants were laying siege to it
12  king jehoiʹachin of judah went out to the king of babylon along with his mother his servants his princes and his court officials and the king of babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign
13  then he took out from there all the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the kings house
he cut into pieces all the gold utensils that solʹomon the king of israel had made in the temple of jehovah just as jehovah had foretold
14  he took into exile all jerusalem all the princes all the mighty warriors and every craftsman and metalworkerhe took 10000 into exile
no one was left behind except the poorest people of the land
15  thus he took jehoiʹachin into exile to babylon he also led away the kings mother the kings wives his court officials and the foremost men of the land taking them into exile from jerusalem to babylon
16  the king of babylon also took into exile to babylon all the warriors 7000 as well as 1000 craftsmen and metalworkers all of them mighty men and trained for war
17  the king of babylon made mattaniʹah jehoiʹachins uncle king in his place and changed his name to zedekiʹah
18  zedekiʹah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was hamuʹtal the daughter of jeremiah from libʹnah
19  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes according to all that jehoiʹakim had done
20  it was because of jehovahs anger that these things took place in jerusalem and in judah until he cast them out of his sight
and zedekiʹah rebelled against the king of babylon
5  now naʹaman the army chief of the king of syria was a prominent man who was held in esteem by his lord because through him jehovah had given victory to syria
he was a mighty warrior although he was a leper
2  on one of their raids the syrians had taken captive from the land of israel a little girl who became a servant to naʹamans wife
3  she said to her mistress if only my lord would visit the prophet in samarʹia then he would cure him of his leprosy
4  so he went and reported to his lord telling him what the girl from israel had said
5  then the king of syria said go now and i will send a letter to the king of israel
so he went taking with him ten talents of silver 6000 pieces of gold and ten changes of garments
6  he brought to the king of israel the letter which read along with this letter that has come to you i send my servant naʹaman so that you may cure him of his leprosy
7  as soon as the king of israel read the letter he ripped his garments apart and said am i god to put to death and to keep alive for he is sending this man to me telling me to cure him of his leprosy you can see for yourselves that he is seeking a quarrel with me
8  but when eliʹsha the man of the true god heard that the king of israel had ripped his garments apart he at once sent word to the king why did you rip your garments apart please let him come to me so that he may know that there is a prophet in israel
9  so naʹaman came with his horses and his war chariots and stood at the entrance of the house of eliʹsha
10  however eliʹsha sent a messenger to tell him go wash seven times in the jordan and your flesh will be restored and you will be clean
11  at this naʹaman became indignant and started to leave saying here i said to myself he will come out to me and stand here and call on the name of jehovah his god moving his hand back and forth over the leprosy to cure it
12  are not the abaʹnah and the pharʹpar the rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel can i not wash in them and become clean with that he turned and went away in a rage
13  his servants now approached him and said my father if the prophet had told you to do something extraordinary would you not do it how much more then since he only said to you wash and be clean
14  at that he went down and plunged into the jordan seven times according to the word of the man of the true god
then his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little boy and he became clean
15  after that he went back to the man of the true god he and all his entourage and he stood before him and said now i know that there is no god anywhere in all the earth but in israel
now accept please a gift from your servant
16  however eliʹsha said as surely as jehovah whom i serve is living i will not accept it
he urged him to accept it but he kept refusing
17  finally naʹaman said if not please let your servant be given two muleloads of soil from this land for your servant will no longer offer a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any gods other than jehovah
18  but may jehovah forgive your servant for this one thing when my lord goes into the house of rimʹmon to bow down there he supports himself on my arm so i have to bow down at the house of rimʹmon
when i bow down at the house of rimʹmon may jehovah please forgive your servant for this
19  at this he said to him go in peace
after he departed from him and had traveled for some distance
20  gehaʹzi the attendant of eliʹsha the man of the true god said to himself here my master has spared this syrian naʹaman by not accepting from him what he brought
as surely as jehovah is living i will run after him and take something from him
21  so gehaʹzi chased after naʹaman
when naʹaman saw someone running after him he got down from his chariot to meet him and said is everything all right
22  to this he said all is well
my master has sent me saying look just now two young men from the mountainous region of eʹphraim from the sons of the prophets came to me
give them please a talent of silver and two changes of garments
23  naʹaman said go on take two talents
he kept urging him and he wrapped up two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and gave them to two of his attendants who carried them before him
24  when he reached oʹphel he took them from their hand and put them in the house and sent the men away
after they left
25  he went in and stood by his master
eliʹsha now said to him where did you come from gehaʹzi but he said your servant did not go anywhere
26  eliʹsha said to him was my heart not there with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you is it a time to accept silver or to accept garments or olive groves or vineyards or sheep or cattle or male or female servants
27  now naʹamans leprosy will stick to you and your descendants forever
immediately he went out from before him a leper white as snow
15  in the 27th year of king jeroboʹam of israel azariʹah the son of king amaziʹah of judah became king
2  he was 16 years old when he became king and he reigned for 52 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was jecoliʹah of jerusalem
3  he continued to do what was right in jehovahs eyes just as his father amaziʹah had done
4  however the high places were not removed and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places
5  jehovah afflicted the king and he remained a leper until the day of his death and he stayed in a separate house while the kings son joʹtham was in charge of the house judging the people of the land
6  as for the rest of the history of azariʹah all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
7  then azariʹah was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him with his forefathers in the city of david and his son joʹtham became king in his place
8  in the 38th year of king azariʹah of judah zechariʹah the son of jeroboʹam became king over israel in samarʹia and he reigned for six months
9  he did what was bad in jehovahs eyes just as his forefathers had done
he did not depart from the sins that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had caused israel to commit
10  then shalʹlum the son of jaʹbesh conspired against him and struck him down at ibʹleam
after putting him to death he became king in his place
11  as for the rest of the history of zechariʹah it is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
12  that fulfilled jehovahs word spoken to jeʹhu four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of israel
and that is how it happened
13  shalʹlum the son of jaʹbesh became king in the 39th year of king uzziʹah of judah and he reigned for a full month in samarʹia
14  then menʹahem the son of gaʹdi came up from tirʹzah to samarʹia and struck down shalʹlum the son of jaʹbesh in samarʹia
after putting him to death he became king in his place
15  as for the rest of the history of shalʹlum and the conspiracy that he formed it is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
16  it was then that menʹahem came from tirʹzah and struck down tiphʹsah and all who were in it and its territory because it did not open its gates to him
he struck it down and ripped open its pregnant women
17  in the 39th year of king azariʹah of judah menʹahem the son of gaʹdi became king over israel and he reigned for ten years in samarʹia
18  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes
he did not depart from all the sins that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had caused israel to commit all his days
19  king pul of assyrʹia came into the land and menʹahem gave pul 1000 talents of silver in return for his support in strengthening his hold on the kingdom
20  so menʹahem raised the silver from israel by exacting it from the prominent wealthy men
he gave the king of assyrʹia 50 silver shekels for each man
then the king of assyrʹia turned back and did not stay in the land
21  as for the rest of the history of menʹahem all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
22  then menʹahem was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son pekahiʹah became king in his place
23  in the 50th year of king azariʹah of judah pekahiʹah the son of menʹahem became king over israel in samarʹia and he reigned for two years
24  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes
he did not depart from the sins that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had caused israel to commit
25  then his adjutant peʹkah the son of remaliʹah conspired against him and struck him down in samarʹia in the fortified tower of the kings house with arʹgob and ariʹeh
he had 50 men of gilʹead with him and after he put him to death he became king in his place
26  as for the rest of the history of pekahiʹah all that he did it is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
27  in the 52nd year of king azariʹah of judah peʹkah the son of remaliʹah became king over israel in samarʹia and he reigned for 20 years
28  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes and he did not depart from the sins that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had caused israel to commit
29  in the days of king peʹkah of israel king tigʹlathpileʹser of assyrʹia invaded and captured iʹjon aʹbelbethmaʹacah janoʹah keʹdesh haʹzor gilʹead and galʹilee all the land of naphʹtali and he took the inhabitants into exile in assyrʹia
30  then hosheʹa the son of eʹlah formed a conspiracy against peʹkah the son of remaliʹah and he struck him and put him to death and he became king in his place in the 20th year of joʹtham the son of uzziʹah
31  as for the rest of the history of peʹkah all that he did it is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
32  in the second year of peʹkah the son of remaliʹah the king of israel joʹtham the son of king uzziʹah of judah became king
33  he was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was jeruʹsha the daughter of zaʹdok
34  he kept doing what was right in jehovahs eyes just as his father uzziʹah had done
35  however the high places were not removed and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places
he was the one who built the upper gate of the house of jehovah
36  as for the rest of the history of joʹtham what he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
37  in those days jehovah began sending reʹzin the king of syria and peʹkah the son of remaliʹah against judah
38  then joʹtham was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the city of david his forefather
and his son aʹhaz became king in his place
20  in those days hezekiʹah became sick and was at the point of death
the prophet isaiah the son of aʹmoz came and said to him this is what jehovah says give instructions to your household for you will die you will not recover
2  at that he turned his face to the wall and began to pray to jehovah
3  i beg you o jehovah remember please how i have walked before you faithfully and with a complete heart and i have done what was good in your eyes
and hezekiʹah began to weep profusely
4  isaiah had not yet gone out to the middle courtyard when jehovahs word came to him saying
5  go back and say to hezekiʹah the leader of my people this is what jehovah the god of david your forefather says i have heard your prayer
i have seen your tears
here i am healing you
on the third day you will go up to the house of jehovah
6  i will add 15 years to your life and i will rescue you and this city out of the hand of the king of assyrʹia and i will defend this city for my own sake and for the sake of david my servant
7  isaiah then said bring a cake of pressed dried figs
so they brought it and applied it to the boil after which he gradually recovered
8  hezekiʹah had asked isaiah what is the sign to show that jehovah will heal me and that i will go up on the third day to the house of jehovah
9  isaiah replied this is the sign from jehovah to show you that jehovah will carry out the word that he has spoken do you want the shadow on the stairway to move forward ten steps or back ten steps
10  hezekiʹah said it is an easy thing for the shadow to extend itself ten steps but not to go back ten steps
11  so isaiah the prophet called out to jehovah and he made the shadow on the stairway of aʹhaz go back ten steps after it had already descended the steps
12  at that time the king of babylon beroʹdachbalʹadan son of balʹadan sent letters and a gift to hezekiʹah for he had heard that hezekiʹah had been sick
13  hezekiʹah welcomed them and showed them his entire treasurehousethe silver the gold the balsam oil and other precious oil his armory and everything that was to be found in his treasuries
there was nothing that hezekiʹah did not show them in his own house and in all his dominion
14  after that isaiah the prophet came in to king hezekiʹah and asked him what did these men say and where did they come from so hezekiʹah said they came from a distant land from babylon
15  next he asked what did they see in your house hezekiʹah replied they saw everything in my house
there was nothing that i did not show them in my treasuries
16  isaiah now said to hezekiʹah hear the word of jehovah
17  look days are coming and all that is in your house and all that your forefathers have stored up to this day will be carried off to babylon
nothing will be left says jehovah
18  and some of your own sons to whom you will become father will be taken and will become court officials in the palace of the king of babylon
19  at that hezekiʹah said to isaiah the word of jehovah that you have spoken is good
then he added it is good if there will be peace and stability during my lifetime
20  as for the rest of the history of hezekiʹah all his mightiness and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought the water into the city is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
21  then hezekiʹah was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son manasʹseh became king in his place
1  after the death of aʹhab moʹab revolted against israel
2  it was then that ahaziʹah fell down through the grating in his roof chamber in samarʹia and was injured
so he sent messengers and said to them go inquire of baʹalzeʹbub the god of ekʹron to find out whether i will recover from this injury
3  but the angel of jehovah said to eliʹjah the tishʹbite rise up go to meet the messengers of the king of samarʹia and say to them is it because there is no god in israel that you are going to inquire of baʹalzeʹbub the god of ekʹron
4  therefore this is what jehovah says you will not leave the bed on which you are lying for you will certainly die
with that eliʹjah went off
5  when the messengers returned to him he immediately said to them why have you come back
6  they replied to him there was a man who came up to meet us and he said to us go return to the king who sent you and tell him this is what jehovah says is it because there is no god in israel that you are sending to inquire of baʹalzeʹbub the god of ekʹron therefore you will not leave the bed on which you are lying for you will certainly die
7  at this he asked them what did the man look like who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you
8  so they said to him he was a man with a garment of hair and a leather belt around his waist
immediately he said it was eliʹjah the tishʹbite
9  the king then sent to him a chief of 50 with his 50 men
when he went up to him he was sitting on the top of the mountain
he said to him man of the true god the king says come down
10  but eliʹjah answered the chief of the 50 well if i am a man of god let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your 50 men
and fire came down from the heavens and consumed him and his 50 men
11  so the king sent again to him another chief of 50 with his 50 men
he went and said to him man of the true god this is what the king says come down quickly
12  but eliʹjah answered them if i am a man of the true god let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your 50 men
and fire of god came down from the heavens and consumed him and his 50 men
13  then the king sent again a third chief of 50 and his 50 men
but the third chief of 50 went up and bowed down on his knees in front of eliʹjah and began to beg for favor and say to him man of the true god please let my life and the lives of these 50 servants of yours be precious in your eyes
14  fire has already come down from the heavens and consumed the two former chiefs of 50 and their groups of 50 but now let my life be precious in your eyes
15  at that the angel of jehovah told eliʹjah go down with him
do not be afraid of him
so he rose and went down with him to the king
16  eliʹjah then said to the king this is what jehovah says you sent messengers to inquire of baʹalzeʹbub the god of ekʹron
is it because there is no god in israel why did you not inquire of his word therefore you will not leave the bed on which you are lying for you will certainly die
17  so he died according to the word of jehovah that eliʹjah had spoken and because he did not have a son jehoʹram became king in his place in the second year of jehoʹram the son of jehoshʹaphat the king of judah
18  as for the rest of the history of ahaziʹah what he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel
2  when jehovah was about to take eliʹjah up to the heavens in a windstorm eliʹjah and eliʹsha went out from gilʹgal
2  eliʹjah said to eliʹsha stay here please because jehovah has sent me on to bethʹel
but eliʹsha said as surely as jehovah is living and as you are living i will not leave you
so they went down to bethʹel
3  then the sons of the prophets in bethʹel came out to eliʹsha and said to him do you know that today jehovah is taking your master away from headship over you at this he said i already know it
be silent
4  eliʹjah now said to him eliʹsha stay here please because jehovah has sent me on to jerʹicho
but he said as surely as jehovah is living and as you are living i will not leave you
so they came to jerʹicho
5  then the sons of the prophets who were in jerʹicho approached eliʹsha and said to him do you know that today jehovah is taking your master away from headship over you at this he said i already know it
be silent
6  eliʹjah now said to him stay here please because jehovah has sent me on to the jordan
but he said as surely as jehovah is living and as you are living i will not leave you
so both of them went on
7  and 50 of the sons of the prophets also went and stood watching from a distance while the two of them stood by the jordan
8  then eliʹjah took his official garment and rolled it up and struck the waters and they were divided to the left and to the right so that both of them went across on the dry ground
9  as soon as they had gone across eliʹjah said to eliʹsha ask what you want me to do for you before i am taken from you
so eliʹsha said please may i receive a double portion of your spirit
10  he replied you have asked a difficult thing
if you see me when i am taken from you it will happen for you that way but if you do not it will not happen
11  as they were walking along speaking as they walked suddenly a fiery chariot and fiery horses made a separation between the two of them and eliʹjah ascended to the heavens in the windstorm
12  while eliʹsha was watching he was crying out my father my father the chariot of israel and his horsemen when he could no longer see him he took hold of his own garments and ripped them into two pieces
13  after that he picked up the official garment of eliʹjah that had fallen off him and went back and stood by the bank of the jordan
14  then he took the official garment of eliʹjah that had fallen off him and struck the waters and said where is jehovah the god of eliʹjah when he struck the waters they were divided to the left and to the right so that eliʹsha went across
15  when the sons of the prophets at jerʹicho saw him from a distance they said the spirit of eliʹjah has settled down on eliʹsha
so they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him
16  they said to him here are 50 capable men with your servants
let them go please to look for your master
perhaps the spirit of jehovah has lifted him up and then thrown him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys
but he said do not send them
17  however they kept urging him until he was embarrassed so he said send them
they sent the 50 men who kept looking for three days but did not find him
18  when they returned to him he was staying in jerʹicho
then he said to them did i not tell you not to go
19  in time the men of the city said to eliʹsha my master can see that the city is wellsituated but the water is bad and the land is barren
20  at that he said bring me a small new bowl and put salt in it
so they brought it to him
21  then he went out to the source of the water and threw salt into it and said this is what jehovah says i have healed this water
no more will it cause death or barrenness
22  and the water has been healed down to this day according to the word spoken by eliʹsha
23  he went up from there to bethʹel
as he was going along the way some young boys came out from the city and began to jeer at him and they kept saying to him go up you baldhead go up you baldhead
24  finally he turned around and looked at them and cursed them in the name of jehovah
then two shebears came out of the forest and tore 42 of the children to pieces
25  he kept going from there to mount carʹmel and from there he returned to samarʹia
3  jehoʹram the son of aʹhab became king over israel in samarʹia in the 18th year of king jehoshʹaphat of judah and he reigned for 12 years
2  he kept doing what was bad in jehovahs eyes but not to the extent of his father or his mother for he removed the sacred pillar of baʹal that his father had made
3  however he clung to the sins that jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat had caused israel to commit
he did not depart from them
4  now meʹsha the king of moʹab was a sheep raiser and he used to pay 100000 lambs and 100000 unshorn rams as tribute to the king of israel
5  as soon as aʹhab died the king of moʹab revolted against the king of israel
6  so king jehoʹram went out on that day from samarʹia and mustered all israel
7  he also sent a message to king jehoshʹaphat of judah saying the king of moʹab has revolted against me
will you go with me to war against moʹab to this he said i will go
i am the same as you
my people are the same as your people
my horses are the same as your horses
8  then he asked by which way should we go up he replied by the way of the wilderness of eʹdom
9  the king of israel then set out with the king of judah and the king of eʹdom
after they journeyed roundabout for seven days there was no water for the camp and for the domestic animals that were following behind them
10  the king of israel said how terrible jehovah has called these three kings only to give them into the hand of moʹab
11  at that jehoshʹaphat said is there no prophet of jehovah here through whom we may inquire of jehovah so one of the servants of the king of israel answered there is eliʹsha the son of shaʹphat who used to pour out water on the hands of eliʹjah
12  then jehoshʹaphat said the word of jehovah is with him
so the king of israel and jehoshʹaphat and the king of eʹdom went down to him
13  eliʹsha said to the king of israel what do i have to do with you go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother
but the king of israel said to him no for it is jehovah who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of moʹab
14  to this eliʹsha said as surely as jehovah of armies whom i serve is living if i did not have regard for king jehoshʹaphat of judah i would not look at you or take notice of you
15  now bring me a harpist
as soon as the harpist started playing the hand of jehovah came on him
16  he said this is what jehovah says dig trench after trench in this valley
17  for this is what jehovah says you will not see wind and you will not see rain yet this valley will be filled with water and you will drink from it you your livestock and your other animals
18  but this is a trivial thing in the eyes of jehovah for he will also give moʹab into your hand
19  you must strike down every fortified city and every choice city you should cut down every good tree you should stop up all the springs of water and you should ruin every good plot of land with stones
20  and in the morning at the time of the morning grain offering water was suddenly coming from the direction of eʹdom and the land became filled with the water
21  all the moʹabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them so they called together all the men who could bear arms and they stationed themselves at the border
22  when they got up early in the morning the sun was shining on the water and to the moʹabites on the opposite side the water looked red like blood
23  they said this is blood the kings have surely slaughtered one another with the sword
so then to the spoil o moʹab
24  when they came into the camp of israel the israelites rose up and began striking down the moʹabites who fled from them
they advanced into moʹab striking the moʹabites down as they went
25  they tore down the cities and each man threw a stone into every good plot of land filling it with stones they stopped up every spring of water and they cut down every good tree
finally only the stone walls of kirharʹeseth remained standing and the slingers surrounded it and struck it down
26  when the king of moʹab saw that the battle was lost he took with him 700 men armed with swords to break through to the king of eʹdom but they were not able to
27  so he took his firstborn son who was going to reign in his place and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall
and there came to be great indignation against israel so they withdrew from against him and returned to their land
12  in the seventh year of jeʹhu jehoʹash became king and he reigned for 40 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was zibʹiah from beʹersheʹba
2  jehoʹash continued doing what was right in jehovahs eyes all the days that jehoiʹada the priest instructed him
3  however the high places were not removed and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places
4  jehoʹash said to the priests take all the money that is brought to the house of jehovah for the holy offerings the money for which each one is assessed the money given as an estimated value for a person and all the money that each persons heart is moved to bring to the house of jehovah
5  the priests will personally take it from their donors and use it to repair the house wherever any damage is found
6  by the 23rd year of king jehoʹash the priests had not yet repaired the damage to the house
7  so king jehoʹash called jehoiʹada the priest and the other priests and said to them why are you not repairing the damage to the house therefore do not take any more money from your donors unless it is used to repair the house
8  at that the priests agreed not to take any more money from the people and not to be responsible for repairing the house
9  jehoiʹada the priest then took a chest and bored a hole in its lid and put it next to the altar on the right as one enters the house of jehovah
that is where the priests who served as doorkeepers would put all the money that was brought into the house of jehovah
10  whenever they saw that there was a great deal of money in the chest the secretary of the king and the high priest would come up and collect and count the money that had been brought to the house of jehovah
11  they would give the money that had been counted to those appointed over the work being done in the house of jehovah
they in turn paid it to the woodworkers and to the builders who were working at the house of jehovah
12  as well as to the masons and the stonecutters
they also bought timbers and hewn stones for repairing the damage to the house of jehovah and used the money for all the other expenses incurred in repairing the house
13  however none of the money brought to the house of jehovah was used to make basins of silver extinguishers bowls trumpets or any sort of gold or silver article for the house of jehovah
14  they would give it only to those who did the work and with it they repaired the house of jehovah
15  they would not call for an accounting from the men to whom they gave the money to give to the workers for they were trustworthy
16  however the money for guilt offerings and the money for sin offerings was not brought to the house of jehovah it belonged to the priests
17  it was then that hazʹael the king of syria went up to fight against gath and he captured it after which he decided to attack jerusalem
18  at that king jehoʹash of judah took all the holy offerings that his forefathers jehoshʹaphat jehoʹram and ahaziʹah the kings of judah had sanctified as well as his own holy offerings and all the gold to be found in the treasuries of the house of jehovah and the kings house and sent them to hazʹael the king of syria
so he withdrew from jerusalem
19  as for the rest of the history of jehoʹash all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of judah
20  however his servants joined in a conspiracy against him and struck jehoʹash down at the house of the mound on the way that goes down to silʹla
21  his servants joʹzacar the son of shimʹeath and jehozʹabad the son of shoʹmer were the ones who struck him and put him to death
they buried him with his forefathers in the city of david and his son amaziʹah became king in his place
