18  here is my greeting pauls in my own hand
keep my prison bonds in mind
the undeserved kindness be with you
1  paul an apostle of christ jesus through gods will and timothy our brother
2  to the holy ones and faithful brothers in union with christ at colosʹsae may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god our father
3  we always thank god the father of our lord jesus christ when we pray for you
4  since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and the love you have for all the holy ones
5  because of the hope that is being reserved for you in the heavens
you previously heard about this hope through the message of truth of the good news
6  that has come to you
just as the good news is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world so it is also doing among you from the day you heard and accurately knew the undeserved kindness of god in truth
7  that is what you have learned from our beloved fellow slave epʹaphras who is a faithful minister of the christ on our behalf
8  he also made known to us your love in a spiritual way
9  that is also why from the day we heard of it we have never stopped praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual comprehension
10  so as to walk worthily of jehovah in order to please him fully as you go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of god
11  and may you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may endure fully with patience and joy
12  as you thank the father who made you qualify to share in the inheritance of the holy ones in the light
13  he rescued us from the authority of the darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son
14  by means of whom we have our release by ransom the forgiveness of our sins
15  he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation
16  because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth the things visible and the things invisible whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities
all other things have been created through him and for him
17  also he is before all other things and by means of him all other things were made to exist
18  and he is the head of the body the congregation
he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so that he might become the one who is first in all things
19  because god was pleased to have all fullness to dwell in him
20  and through him to reconcile to himself all other things by making peace through the blood he shed on the torture stake whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens
21  indeed you who were once alienated and enemies because your minds were on the works that were wicked
22  he has now reconciled by means of that ones fleshly body through his death in order to present you holy and unblemished and open to no accusation before him
23  provided of course that you continue in the faith established on the foundation and steadfast not being shifted away from the hope of that good news that you heard and that was preached in all creation under heaven
of this good news i paul became a minister
24  i am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake and i am undergoing the tribulations of the christ that are yet lacking in my flesh in behalf of his body which is the congregation
25  i became a minister of this congregation in accord with the stewardship from god that was given to me in your behalf to preach the word of god fully
26  the sacred secret that was hidden from the past systems of things and from the past generations
but now it has been revealed to his holy ones
27  to whom god has been pleased to make known among the nations the glorious riches of this sacred secret which is christ in union with you the hope of his glory
28  he is the one we are proclaiming admonishing everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom so that we may present every person complete in union with christ
29  to this end i am indeed working hard exerting myself with his strength that is operating powerfully within me
2  for i want you to realize how great a struggle i am having in your behalf and in behalf of those at laodiceʹa and in behalf of all those who have not personally seen me
2  this is so that their hearts may be comforted and that they may be harmoniously joined together in love and may have all the riches that result from the full assurance of their understanding in order to gain an accurate knowledge of the sacred secret of god namely christ
3  carefully concealed in him are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge
4  i am saying this so that no one may delude you with persuasive arguments
5  though i am absent in body i am with you in spirit rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in christ
6  therefore just as you have accepted christ jesus the lord go on walking in union with him
7  being rooted and built up in him and being stabilized in the faith just as you were taught and overflowing with thanksgiving
8  look out that no one takes you captive by means of the philosophy and empty deception according to human tradition according to the elementary things of the world and not according to christ
9  because it is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily
10  so you have acquired a fullness by means of him the one who is the head of all government and authority
11  by your relationship with him you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without hands by stripping off the fleshly body by the circumcision that belongs to the christ
12  for you were buried with him in his baptism and by your relationship with him you were also raised up together through your faith in the powerful work of god who raised him up from the dead
13  furthermore though you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcised state of your flesh god made you alive together with him
he kindly forgave us all our trespasses
14  and erased the handwritten document that consisted of decrees and was in opposition to us
he has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture stake
15  he has stripped the governments and the authorities bare and has publicly exhibited them as conquered leading them in a triumphal procession by means of it
16  therefore do not let anyone judge you about what you eat and drink or about the observance of a festival or of the new moon or of a sabbath
17  those things are a shadow of the things to come but the reality belongs to the christ
18  let no man deprive you of the prize who takes delight in a false humility and a form of worship of the angels taking his stand on the things he has seen
he is actually puffed up without proper cause by his fleshly frame of mind
19  and he is not holding fast to the head to the one through whom the whole body is supplied and harmoniously joined together by means of its joints and ligaments and made to grow with the growth that is from god
20  if you died together with christ with respect to the elementary things of the world why do you live as if still part of the world by further subjecting yourselves to the decrees
21  do not handle nor taste nor touch
22  referring to things that all perish with their use according to the commands and teachings of men
23  although those things have an appearance of wisdom in a selfimposed form of worship and a false humility a harsh treatment of the body they are of no value in combating the satisfying of the flesh
3  if however you were raised up with the christ go on seeking the things above where the christ is seated at the right hand of god
2  keep your minds fixed on the things above not on the things on the earth
3  for you died and your life has been hidden with the christ in union with god
4  when the christ our life is made manifest then you also will be made manifest with him in glory
5  deaden therefore your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality uncleanness uncontrolled sexual passion hurtful desire and greediness which is idolatry
6  on account of those things the wrath of god is coming
7  that is how you too used to conduct yourselves in your former way of life
8  but now you must put them all away from you wrath anger badness abusive speech and obscene talk out of your mouth
9  do not lie to one another
strip off the old personality with its practices
10  and clothe yourselves with the new personality which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the one who created it
11  where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision foreigner scythʹian slave or freeman but christ is all things and in all
12  accordingly as gods chosen ones holy and loved clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion kindness humility mildness and patience
13  continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another
just as jehovah freely forgave you you must also do the same
14  but besides all these things clothe yourselves with love for it is a perfect bond of union
15  also let the peace of the christ rule in your hearts for you were called to that peace in one body
and show yourselves thankful
16  let the word of the christ reside in you richly in all wisdom
keep on teaching and encouraging one another with psalms praises to god spiritual songs sung with gratitude singing in your hearts to jehovah
17  whatever it is that you do in word or in deed do everything in the name of the lord jesus thanking god the father through him
18  you wives be in subjection to your husbands as it is becoming in the lord
19  you husbands keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them
20  you children be obedient to your parents in everything for this is wellpleasing to the lord
21  you fathers do not be exasperating your children so that they do not become downhearted
22  you slaves be obedient in everything to those who are your human masters not only when they are watching just to please men but with sincerity of heart with fear of jehovah
23  whatever you are doing work at it wholesouled as for jehovah and not for men
24  for you know that it is from jehovah you will receive the inheritance as a reward
slave for the master christ
25  certainly the one who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done and there is no partiality
