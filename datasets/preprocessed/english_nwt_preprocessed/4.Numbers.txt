10  jehovah then said to moses
2  make two trumpets for yourself make them of hammered silver and use them to summon the assembly and to break up the camps
3  when both of them are blown the whole assembly must be summoned to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting
4  if just one is blown only the chieftains the heads of the thousands of israel will be summoned to you
5  when you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast the camps of those to the east should depart
6  when you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast a second time the camps of those to the south should depart
they should sound the trumpet blasts in this way each time one of them departs
7  now when calling the congregation together you should blow the trumpets but not with fluctuating blasts
8  aarons sons the priests should blow the trumpets and the use of them will serve as a lasting statute for you throughout your generations
9  if you should go to war in your land against an oppressor who is harassing you you should sound a war call on the trumpets and you will be remembered by jehovah your god and be saved from your enemies
10  also on your joyous occasionsyour festivals and at the beginning of your monthsyou are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices they will serve as a reminder for you before your god
i am jehovah your god
11  now in the second year in the second month on the 20th day of the month the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony
12  so the israelites began to pull away from the wilderness of siʹnai in the order established for their departure and the cloud settled in the wilderness of paʹran
13  this was the first time they departed following the order of jehovah through moses
14  so the threetribe division of the camp of the sons of judah departed first by their companies and nahʹshon the son of amminʹadab was over its company
15  over the company of the tribe of the sons of isʹsachar was nethanʹel the son of zuʹar
16  over the company of the tribe of the sons of zebʹulun was eliʹab the son of heʹlon
17  when the tabernacle was taken down the sons of gerʹshon and the sons of merarʹi who carried the tabernacle departed
18  then the threetribe division of the camp of reuʹben departed by their companies and eliʹzur the son of shedʹeur was over its company
19  over the company of the tribe of the sons of simʹeon was sheluʹmiel the son of zurishadʹdai
20  over the company of the tribe of the sons of gad was eliʹasaph the son of deuʹel
21  then the koʹhathites who carried the sanctuary items departed
the tabernacle was to be set up by the time they arrived
22  then the threetribe division of the camp of the sons of eʹphraim departed by their companies and elishʹama the son of ammiʹhud was over its company
23  over the company of the tribe of the sons of manasʹseh was gamaʹliel the son of pedahʹzur
24  over the company of the tribe of the sons of benjamin was abʹidan the son of gideoʹni
25  then the threetribe division of the camp of the sons of dan departed by their companies forming the rear guard for all the camps and ahieʹzer the son of ammishadʹdai was over its company
26  over the company of the tribe of the sons of ashʹer was paʹgiel the son of ochʹran
27  over the company of the tribe of the sons of naphʹtali was ahiʹra the son of eʹnan
28  this was the order of departure that the israelites and their companies followed when they would depart
29  then moses said to hoʹbab the son of reuʹel the midʹianite the fatherinlaw of moses we are setting out for the place about which jehovah said i will give it to you
do come with us and we will treat you well because jehovah has promised good things for israel
30  but he said to him i will not go
i will return to my own country and to my relatives
31  at this he said please do not leave us for you know where we should camp in the wilderness and you can serve as our guide
32  and if you do come with us whatever goodness jehovah shows to us we will surely show to you
33  so they began marching from the mountain of jehovah for a journey of three days and the ark of jehovahs covenant traveled before them for the threeday journey to search out a restingplace for them
34  and jehovahs cloud was over them by day when they set out from the encampment
35  whenever the ark was moved moses would say rise up o jehovah and let your enemies be scattered and let those who hate you flee from before you
36  and when it would rest he would say do return o jehovah to the countless thousands of israel
4  jehovah now spoke to moses and aaron saying
2  a census should be taken of the sons of koʹhath from among the sons of leʹvi by their families and by their paternal houses
3  all those from 30 to 50 years old who are in the group assigned to work in the tent of meeting
4  this is the service of the sons of koʹhath in the tent of meeting
it is something most holy
5  aaron and his sons will come in when the camp is departing and take down the screening curtain and cover the ark of the testimony with it
6  they will put a sealskin covering over it and spread out a solid blue cloth over it and put its carrying poles in place
7  they will also spread out a blue cloth over the table of showbread and they will put on it the dishes the cups the bowls and the pitchers of the drink offering the regular offering of bread should remain on it
8  they will spread out a scarlet cloth over them and cover it with a sealskin covering and put its carrying poles in place
9  then they will take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light along with its lamps its snuffers its fire holders and all its containers for oil that are used to maintain it
10  they will wrap it and all its utensils in a sealskin covering and put it on a carrying bar
11  and they will spread out a blue cloth over the golden altar cover it with a sealskin covering and put its carrying poles in place
12  they will then take all the utensils of the ministry with which they regularly minister in the holy place and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a sealskin covering and put them on a carrying bar
13  they should remove the ashes from the altar and spread out a cloth of purple wool over it
14  they will put on it all its utensils that are used when they minister at the altar the fire holders the forks the shovels and the bowls all the utensils of the altar and they are to spread a sealskin covering over it and put its carrying poles in place
15  aaron and his sons must finish covering the holy place and all the utensils of the holy place when the camp is departing
then the sons of koʹhath will come in to carry them but they must not touch the holy place or they will die
these things are the responsibility of the sons of koʹhath in connection with the tent of meeting
16  eleaʹzar the son of aaron the priest is responsible for overseeing the oil of the lighting the perfumed incense the regular grain offering and the anointing oil
he has oversight of the entire tabernacle and all that is in it including the holy place and its utensils
17  jehovah spoke further to moses and aaron saying
18  do not let the tribe of the families of the koʹhathites be cut off from among the levites
19  but do this for them that they may remain alive and not die because of approaching the most holy things
aaron and his sons will go in and assign each of them to his service and what he is to carry
20  they must not come in and see the holy things even for an instant or they will die
21  then jehovah spoke to moses saying
22  a census should be taken of the sons of gerʹshon by their paternal houses and their families
23  you are to register all those from 30 to 50 years old who are in the group assigned to serve in the tent of meeting
24  this is what the families of the gerʹshonites are assigned to care for and to carry
25  they will carry the tent cloths of the tabernacle the tent of meeting its covering and the sealskin covering that is on top over it the screen of the entrance of the tent of meeting
26  the hanging curtains of the courtyard the screen of the entrance of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and the altar their tent cords and all their utensils and everything used in its service
this is their assignment
27  all the service and the loads of the gerʹshonites should be overseen by aaron and his sons you will assign all these loads as their responsibility
28  this is the service that the families of the gerʹshonites are to carry out in the tent of meeting and their responsibilities are under the direction of ithʹamar the son of aaron the priest
29  as for the sons of merarʹi you will register them by family and by their paternal house
30  from 30 to 50 years old you will register them all who are in the group assigned to the service of the tent of meeting

32  the pillars of the surrounding courtyard their socket pedestals their tent pins and their tent cords together with all their equipment and all the service connected with these
you will assign to them by name the equipment they are responsible for carrying
33  this is how the families of the sons of merarʹi are to serve at the tent of meeting under the direction of ithʹamar the son of aaron the priest
34  moses and aaron and the chieftains of the assembly then registered the sons of the koʹhathites by their families and by their paternal house

48  the total of those registered was 8580
49  they were registered at the order of jehovah through moses each according to his assigned service and his load they were registered just as jehovah had commanded moses
26  after the scourge jehovah said to moses and eleaʹzar the son of aaron the priest
2  take a census of the whole assembly of the israelites from 20 years of age and up by their paternal houses counting all those who can serve in the army in israel
3  so moses and eleaʹzar the priest spoke with them in the desert plains of moʹab by the jordan at jerʹicho saying
4  take a census of them from the age of 20 years and up just as jehovah commanded moses

50  these were the families of naphʹtali by their families and their registered ones were 45400
51  this is the total of those registered of the israelites 601730
52  after that jehovah said to moses
53  among these the land should be divided as an inheritance according to the list of the names
54  for the larger groups you should increase the inheritance and for the smaller groups you should reduce the inheritance
each groups inheritance should be given in proportion to the number of those registered
55  however the land should be apportioned by lot
they should receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers
56  each inheritance will be determined by lot and apportioned among the larger and the smaller groups
57  now these were the registered ones of the levites by their families of gerʹshon the family of the gerʹshonites of koʹhath the family of the koʹhathites of merarʹi the family of the merarʹites
58  these were the families of the levites the family of the libʹnites the family of the hebʹronites the family of the mahʹlites the family of the muʹshites the family of the korʹahites
koʹhath became father to amʹram
59  and the name of amʹrams wife was jochʹebed leʹvis daughter whom his wife bore to leʹvi in egypt
and to amʹram she bore aaron and moses and their sister mirʹiam
60  then to aaron there were born naʹdab abiʹhu eleaʹzar and ithʹamar
61  but naʹdab and abiʹhu died for presenting unauthorized fire before jehovah
62  the total of those registered was 23000 all males from a month old and up
for they were not registered among the israelites because no inheritance was to be given to them among the israelites
63  these were the ones registered by moses and eleaʹzar the priest when they registered the israelites in the desert plains of moʹab by the jordan at jerʹicho
64  but among them there was no one who had been registered by moses and aaron the priest in the census of the israelites taken in the wilderness of siʹnai
65  for jehovah had said concerning them they will die without fail in the wilderness
so there was not a man left of them except caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh and joshua the son of nun
11  now the people began to complain bitterly before jehovah
when jehovah heard it his anger flared and a fire from jehovah began to blaze against them and to consume some on the outskirts of the camp
2  when the people began to cry out to moses he made supplication to jehovah and the fire died out
3  so that place was given the name tabʹerah because a fire from jehovah had blazed against them
4  the mixed crowd who were in their midst then expressed selfish longing and the israelites too began to weep again and say who will give us meat to eat
5  how fondly we remember the fish that we used to eat without cost in egypt also the cucumbers the watermelons the leeks the onions and the garlic
6  but now we are withering away
we see nothing at all except this manna
7  incidentally the manna was like coriander seed and it looked like bdellium gum
8  the people would spread out and pick it up and grind it in hand mills or pound it in a mortar
then they would boil it in cooking pots or make it into round loaves and it tasted like an oiled sweet cake
9  when the dew descended on the camp by night the manna would also descend on it
10  moses heard the people weeping family after family each man at the entrance of his tent
and jehovah became very angry and moses was also very displeased
11  then moses said to jehovah why have you afflicted your servant why have i not found favor in your eyes so that you put the burden of all this people on me
12  did i conceive all this people did i give birth to them so that you should tell me carry them in your bosom just as an attendant carries the nursing child to the land that you swore to give to their forefathers
13  from where will i get meat to give to all this people for they keep weeping before me saying give us meat to eat
14  i am not able to bear all this people by myself it is too much for me
15  if this is how you are going to treat me please kill me right now
if i have found favor in your eyes do not make me see any more calamity
16  jehovah replied to moses gather for me 70 men from the elders of israel men whom you recognize as elders and officials of the people and take them to the tent of meeting and have them stand there with you
17  i will come down and speak with you there and i will take away some of the spirit that is on you and place it on them and they will help you in bearing the burden of the people so that you may not have to bear it alone
18  you should say to the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow for you will certainly eat meat because you have wept in jehovahs hearing and have said who will give us meat to eat it was better for us in egypt
jehovah will certainly give you meat and you will eat
19  you will eat not one day nor 2 days nor 5 days nor 10 days nor 20 days
20  but for a whole month of days until it comes out of your nostrils and it has become loathsome to you for you rejected jehovah who is in your midst and you were weeping before him saying why is it that we have come out of egypt
21  then moses said the people i am among number 600000 men on foot and yet you yourself have said meat i will give them and they will eat enough for a whole month of days
22  if whole flocks and herds were slaughtered would it be enough for them or if all the fish of the sea were caught would it be enough for them
23  jehovah then said to moses is the hand of jehovah too short now you will see whether what i say will happen to you or not
24  so moses went out and spoke the words of jehovah to the people
and he gathered 70 men from the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent
25  then jehovah came down in a cloud and spoke to him and took away some of the spirit that was on him and put it on each of the 70 elders
and as soon as the spirit settled down on them they began to behave as prophets but they did not do it again
26  there were two of the men still in the camp
their names were elʹdad and meʹdad
and the spirit began to settle down on them as they were among those whose names had been written down but they had not gone out to the tent
so they began to behave as prophets in the camp
27  and a young man ran and reported to moses elʹdad and meʹdad are behaving as prophets in the camp
28  then joshua the son of nun the minister of moses from his youth responded and said my lord moses restrain them
29  but moses said to him are you jealous for me no i wish that all of jehovahs people were prophets and that jehovah would put his spirit on them
30  later moses returned to the camp along with the elders of israel
31  then a wind from jehovah sprang up and began driving quail from the sea and causing them to fall around the camp about a days journey on this side and a days journey on the other side all around the camp and they were about two cubits deep on the ground
32  so all that day and all night and all the next day the people stayed up and gathered the quail
no one gathered less than ten hoʹmers and they kept spreading them all around the camp for themselves
33  but while the meat was still between their teeth before it could be chewed jehovahs anger blazed against the people and jehovah began striking the people with a very great slaughter
34  so they gave that place the name kibʹrothhattaʹavah because there they buried the people who showed selfish craving
35  from kibʹrothhattaʹavah the people departed for hazeʹroth and they remained at hazeʹroth
8  jehovah spoke to moses saying
2  speak to aaron and tell him when you light up the lamps the seven lamps should shine on the area in front of the lampstand
3  so aaron did this he lit up its lamps for the area in front of the lampstand just as jehovah had commanded moses
4  this is how the lampstand was made it was hammered work of gold from its stem to its blossoms it was hammered work
the lampstand was made according to the vision that jehovah had shown moses
5  jehovah spoke again to moses saying
6  take the levites from among the israelites and cleanse them
7  this is how you should cleanse them sprinkle sincleansing water on them and they must shave their whole body with a razor wash their garments and cleanse themselves
8  then they will take a young bull and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil and you will take another young bull for a sin offering
9  and you are to present the levites before the tent of meeting and gather all the assembly of the israelites
10  when you present the levites before jehovah the israelites are to lay their hands on the levites
11  and aaron must offer the levites before jehovah as a wave offering from the israelites and they will carry out the service of jehovah
12  then the levites will lay their hands on the heads of the bulls and offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to jehovah to make atonement for the levites
13  and you will have the levites stand before aaron and his sons and offer them as a wave offering to jehovah
14  you must separate the levites from among the israelites and the levites will become mine
15  afterward the levites will come in to serve at the tent of meeting
this is how you should cleanse them and offer them as a wave offering
16  for they are given ones given to me from among the israelites
in place of all those who are firstborn of the israelites i will take them for myself
17  for every firstborn among the israelites is mine both man and animal
i sanctified them to myself on the day i struck down every firstborn in the land of egypt
18  i will take the levites in place of all the firstborn among the israelites
19  i will give the levites as given ones to aaron and his sons from among the israelites to carry out the service in behalf of the israelites at the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the israelites so that no plague may occur among the israelites because the people of israel come near the holy place
20  moses and aaron and all the assembly of the israelites did this with the levites
in accord with all that jehovah had commanded moses regarding the levites that is what the israelites did with them
21  so the levites purified themselves and washed their garments after which aaron offered them as a wave offering before jehovah
then aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them
22  thereafter the levites went in to carry out their service at the tent of meeting before aaron and his sons
just as jehovah had commanded moses respecting the levites so they did with them
23  jehovah now spoke to moses saying
24  this applies to the levites from 25 years old and up a man will join the company of those in the service of the tent of meeting
25  but after the age of 50 years he will retire from the service company and not serve any longer
26  he may minister to his brothers who are taking care of the responsibilities at the tent of meeting but he must not perform the service there
this is what you are to do regarding the levites and their responsibilities
30  then moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of israel saying this is the word that jehovah has commanded
2  if a man makes a vow to jehovah or swears an oath to impose on himself a vow of abstinence he must not violate his word
he should do everything he vowed he would do
3  and if a woman makes a vow to jehovah or she imposes a vow of abstinence on herself when she is young and living in the house of her father
4  and her father hears her vow or her abstinence vow that she has imposed on herself and her father offers no objection all her vows will stand and every abstinence vow that she has imposed on herself will stand
5  but if her father forbids her when he hears that she has imposed vows or abstinence vows on herself it will not stand
jehovah will forgive her because her father forbade her
6  however if she should marry a husband while under her vow or the rash promise that she has imposed on herself
7  and her husband hears of it and offers no objection on the day he hears of it her vows or her abstinence vows that she has imposed on herself will stand
8  but if her husband forbids her on the day he hears of it he may annul the vow or the rash promise that she imposed on herself and jehovah will forgive her
9  but if a widow or a divorced woman makes a vow everything that she has imposed on herself will be binding on her
10  however if a woman imposed the vow or the abstinence vow on herself while in the house of her husband
11  and her husband heard it and has not objected or disapproved all her vows or any abstinence vow that she imposed on herself will stand
12  but if on the day he heard them her husband completely annulled whatever vows or abstinence vow she swore to they will not stand
her husband annulled them and jehovah will forgive her
13  regarding any vow or any oath involving an abstinence vow to practice selfdenial her husband should establish it or her husband should annul it
14  but if her husband offers no objection at all from day to day he also establishes all her vows or all her abstinence vows that are upon her
he establishes them because he did not object on the day he heard her make them
15  but if he annuls them later sometime after the day he heard them he will bear the consequences of her guilt
16  these are the regulations that jehovah commanded moses relating to a husband and his wife and relating to a father and his young daughter living in his house
16  then korʹah the son of izʹhar the son of koʹhath the son of leʹvi got up together with daʹthan and abiʹram the sons of eliʹab and on the son of peʹleth of the sons of reuʹben
2  they rose up against moses along with 250 israelite men chieftains of the assembly chosen ones of the congregation prominent men
3  so they gathered together against moses and aaron and said to them we have had enough of you the whole assembly is holy all of them and jehovah is in their midst
why then should you exalt yourselves above the congregation of jehovah
4  when moses heard this he at once fell facedown
5  then he said to korʹah and to all his supporters in the morning jehovah will make known who belongs to him and who is holy and who should approach him and whomever he may choose will approach him
6  do this take fire holders korʹah and all your supporters
7  and put fire in them and place incense on them before jehovah tomorrow and the man whom jehovah will choose he is the holy one
you sons of leʹvi have gone far enough
8  moses then said to korʹah listen please you sons of leʹvi
9  does it seem to you such a little thing that the god of israel has separated you from the assembly of israel and allowed you to approach him in order to perform the service of jehovahs tabernacle and to stand before the assembly to minister to them
10  and that he brought you near to him along with all your brothers the sons of leʹvi must you also try to secure the priesthood
11  for this reason you and all your supporters who are gathering together are against jehovah
as for aaron who is he that you should murmur against him
12  moses later sent for daʹthan and abiʹram the sons of eliʹab but they said we are not going to come
13  is it so little a thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the wilderness now do you also want to make yourself an absolute ruler over us
14  as it is you have not brought us into any land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of field and vineyard
would you bore out the eyes of those men we are not going to come
15  so moses became very angry and said to jehovah do not turn to look at their grain offering
not one donkey have i taken away from them nor have i harmed one of them
16  then moses said to korʹah present yourself with all your supporters before jehovah tomorrow you and they and aaron
17  each one should take his fire holder and put incense on it and each will present his fire holder before jehovah 250 fire holders together with you and aaron each with his fire holder
18  so each of them took his fire holder and they put fire and incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting together with moses and aaron
19  when korʹah had gathered his supporters against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting jehovahs glory appeared to all the assembly
20  jehovah now told moses and aaron
21  separate yourselves from among this group so that i may exterminate them in an instant
22  at this they fell with their faces to the ground and said o god the god of the spirit of all people will one mans sin cause you to become indignant against the entire assembly
23  jehovah then said to moses
24  speak to the assembly and tell them get away from around the tents of korʹah daʹthan and abiʹram
25  then moses got up and went to daʹthan and abiʹram and the elders of israel went with him
26  he told the assembly move away please from the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them so that you may not be swept away in all their sin
27  they immediately moved away from the tents of korʹah daʹthan and abiʹram from every side and daʹthan and abiʹram came out taking their stand at the entrance of their tents together with their wives their sons and their little children
28  then moses said by this you will know that jehovah has sent me to do all these things that it is not of my own heart
29  if these people die a natural death as all men do and if their punishment is the same as that of all mankind then jehovah has not sent me
30  but if jehovah does something extraordinary with them and the ground opens and swallows them and everything that belongs to them and they go down alive into the grave you will certainly know that these men have treated jehovah disrespectfully
31  as soon as he finished speaking all these words the ground beneath them split apart
32  and the earth opened and swallowed them up along with their households and everyone who belonged to korʹah and all their goods
33  so they and all who belonged to them went down alive into the grave and the earth covered them over so that they perished from the midst of the congregation
34  all the israelites who were around them fled at their screaming for they said we are afraid that the earth may swallow us up
35  then a fire came out from jehovah and consumed the 250 men offering the incense
36  jehovah now said to moses
37  tell eleaʹzar the son of aaron the priest to take the fire holders out of the fire for they are holy
also tell him to scatter the fire some distance away
38  the fire holders of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives should be made into thin metal plates to overlay the altar because they presented them before jehovah and they became holy
they should serve as a sign to the israelites
39  so eleaʹzar the priest took the copper fire holders that had been presented by those who were burned up and beat them to overlay the altar
40  just as jehovah had told him through moses
it was a reminder for the israelites that no unauthorized person who is not of the offspring of aaron should approach to burn incense before jehovah and that no one should become like korʹah and his supporters
41  on the very next day the whole assembly of the israelites began to murmur against moses and aaron saying you two have put jehovahs people to death
42  when the assembly had gathered together against moses and aaron they then turned toward the tent of meeting and look the cloud covered it and jehovahs glory began to appear
43  moses and aaron went before the tent of meeting
44  and jehovah said to moses
45  you men remove yourselves from among this assembly so that i may exterminate them in an instant
at this they fell with their faces to the ground
46  moses then said to aaron take the fire holder and put fire from the altar in it and put incense on it and go quickly to the assembly and make atonement for them because indignation has gone out from jehovah
the plague has started
47  aaron at once took it just as moses had said and ran into the midst of the congregation and look the plague had started among the people
so he put the incense on the fire holder and began making atonement for the people
48  he kept standing between the dead and the living and the scourge eventually stopped
49  those who died from the scourge amounted to 14700 besides those dead on account of korʹah
50  when at last aaron returned to moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting the scourge had been stopped
35  jehovah went on to speak to moses on the desert plains of moʹab by the jordan at jerʹicho saying
2  instruct the israelites that they are to give the levites cities to inhabit out of the inheritance they will possess and they should give the levites the pastures around the cities
3  they will inhabit the cities and the pastures will be for their livestock their goods and all their other animals
4  the pastures of the cities that you will give the levites will extend for 1000 cubits from the wall all around the city
5  you should measure outside the city 2000 cubits on the east side 2000 cubits on the south side 2000 cubits on the west side and 2000 cubits on the north side with the city in the middle
these will be the pastures of their cities
6  the cities that you will give to the levites will be 6 cities of refuge which you will give for the manslayer to flee to as well as 42 other cities
7  you are to give to the levites a total of 48 cities together with their pastures
8  the cities you give them will be from the possession of the israelites
from the larger group you will take many and from the smaller group you will take few
each group will give some of its cities to the levites in proportion to the inheritance that it receives
9  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
10  speak to the israelites and tell them you are crossing the jordan to the land of caʹnaan
11  you should choose cities convenient for yourselves to serve as cities of refuge where the manslayer who unintentionally kills someone should flee
12  these cities will serve as a refuge for you from the blood avenger so that the manslayer will not die until he stands trial before the assembly
13  the six cities of refuge that you provide will serve this purpose
14  you will provide three cities on this side of the jordan and three cities in the land of caʹnaan to serve as cities of refuge
15  these six cities will serve as a refuge for the israelites for the foreign resident and for the settler among them for anyone to flee there who unintentionally kills someone
16  but if he struck him with an iron instrument and he dies he is a murderer
the murderer should be put to death without fail
17  and if he struck him with a stone that could cause death and he dies he is a murderer
the murderer should be put to death without fail
18  and if he struck him with a wooden instrument that could cause death and he dies he is a murderer
the murderer should be put to death without fail
19  the avenger of blood is the one who will put the murderer to death
when he encounters him he himself will put him to death
20  if death resulted because he pushed him out of hatred or threw something at him with malicious intent
21  or out of hatred he struck him with his hand and he died the one who struck him will be put to death without fail
he is a murderer
the avenger of blood will put the murderer to death when he encounters him
22  but if it was unexpectedly and not out of hatred that he pushed him or threw any article at him without malicious intent
23  or if he did not see him and caused a stone to fall on him and he was not an enemy or seeking his injury and the person died
24  the assembly should then judge between the one who struck him and the avenger of blood in harmony with these judgments
25  the assembly should then save the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood and return him to his city of refuge to which he had fled and he must dwell in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil
26  but if the manslayer goes out of the boundary of his city of refuge to which he fled
27  and the avenger of blood finds him outside the boundary of his city of refuge and slays the manslayer he has no bloodguilt
28  for he must dwell in his city of refuge until the high priests death
but after the high priests death the manslayer may return to the land that he owns
29  these things will serve for you as a statute for judgment throughout your generations in all your dwelling places
30  whoever kills a person should be put to death as a murderer on the testimony of witnesses but no one will be put to death on the testimony of just one witness
31  you must take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is deserving to die for he should be put to death without fail
32  and you must not take a ransom for one who has fled to his city of refuge allowing him to resume dwelling in his land before the death of the high priest
33  you must not pollute the land in which you live for blood pollutes the land and there may be no atonement for the blood that has been spilled on the land except by the blood of the one who spilled it
34  you must not defile the land in which you dwell in which i am residing for i jehovah am residing in the midst of the people of israel
18  jehovah then said to aaron you and your sons and your paternal house with you will be answerable for any error against the sanctuary and you and your sons with you will be answerable for any error against your priesthood
2  also bring near your brothers of the tribe of leʹvi your ancestral tribe so that they may join you and minister to you and your sons before the tent of the testimony
3  they are to fulfill their responsibilities to you and to the entire tent
however they must not come near the utensils of the holy place and the altar so that neither they nor you may die
4  they will join you and carry out their responsibilities regarding the tent of meeting and all the service of the tent and no unauthorized person may come near to you
5  you must carry out your responsibility toward the holy place and the altar so that no further indignation may come against the people of israel
6  i myself have taken your brothers the levites from among the israelites as a gift for you
they are given to jehovah to care for the service of the tent of meeting
7  you and your sons are responsible for your priestly duties pertaining to the altar and what is inside the curtain and you are to render this service
i have given the service of the priesthood as a gift to you and any unauthorized person who approaches should be put to death
8  jehovah spoke further to aaron i myself put you in charge of the contributions made to me
i have given to you and to your sons a portion of all the holy things contributed by the israelites as a permanent allowance
9  this will be yours out of the most holy offerings made by fire every offering they make including their grain offerings and their sin offerings and their guilt offerings that they bring to me
it is something most holy for you and for your sons
10  in a most holy place you should eat it
every male may eat it
it will be something holy to you
11  this also belongs to you the gifts they contribute together with all the wave offerings of the israelites
i have given them to you and your sons and your daughters with you as a permanent allowance
everyone clean in your house may eat it
12  all the best of the oil and all the best of the new wine and the grain their firstfruits which they give to jehovah i give them to you
13  the first ripe fruits of everything from their land which they will bring to jehovah will become yours
everyone clean in your house may eat it
14  every devoted thing in israel should become yours
15  every firstborn of all living things which they will present to jehovah whether man or animal should become yours
however you should without fail redeem the firstborn of mankind and the firstborn of the unclean animals you should redeem
16  you should redeem it with the redemption price when it is a month old and up by the estimated value of five silver shekels according to the standard shekel of the holy place
it is 20 geʹrahs
17  only the firstborn bull or firstborn male lamb or firstborn goat you should not redeem
they are something holy
you should sprinkle their blood on the altar and their fat you should make smoke as an offering made by fire for a pleasing aroma to jehovah
18  and their flesh should become yours
like the breast of the wave offering and like the right leg it should become yours
19  all the holy contributions that the israelites will contribute to jehovah i have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you as a permanent allowance
it is a lasting covenant of salt before jehovah for you and your offspring with you
20  jehovah went on to say to aaron in their land you will not have an inheritance and no portion of land among them will become yours
i am your portion and your inheritance in the midst of the israelites
21  now see that i have given to the sons of leʹvi every tenth part in israel as an inheritance in return for the service they are carrying out the service of the tent of meeting
22  no longer may the people of israel approach the tent of meeting or else they will incur sin and die
23  the levites themselves are to carry out the service of the tent of meeting and they are the ones who will answer for their error
it is a lasting statute during all your generations that they should not take possession of an inheritance among the israelites
24  for i have given to the levites as an inheritance the tenth part contributed by the people of israel which they will contribute to jehovah
that is why i have said to them in the midst of the israelites they should not take possession of an inheritance
25  then jehovah said to moses
26  you should tell the levites you will receive from the israelites the tenth part that i have given to you from them for your inheritance and you should contribute from it a tenth part of the tenth part as a contribution to jehovah
27  and it will be considered your contribution as though it were the grain of the threshing floor or the full production of the winepress or oil press
28  in this way you will also give a contribution to jehovah from all the tenth parts that you receive from the israelites and from them you are to give the contribution for jehovah to aaron the priest
29  you will make every sort of contribution to jehovah from the very best of all the gifts given to you as something holy
30  and you must say to them when you contribute the best of them then it will be considered for the levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the winepress or oil press
31  you and your household may eat it in any place because it is your wages in return for your service at the tent of meeting
32  you will not incur sin in this as long as you contribute the best from them and you must not profane the holy things of the israelites or you will die
17  jehovah now said to moses
2  speak to the israelites and take from them one rod for each paternal house from the chieftains of each paternal house 12 rods in all
write the name of each one on his rod
3  you should write aarons name on leʹvis rod because there is one rod for the head of each paternal house
4  deposit the rods in the tent of meeting before the testimony where i regularly present myself to you
5  and the rod of the man whom i choose will bud and i will put a stop to the murmuring of the israelites against me which they are also murmuring against you
6  so moses spoke to the israelites and all their chieftains gave him rodsa rod for each chieftain of a paternal house 12 rodsand aarons rod was among their rods
7  then moses deposited the rods before jehovah in the tent of the testimony
8  on the next day when moses went into the tent of the testimony look aarons rod for the house of leʹvi had budded and was bringing forth buds and blossoming flowers and bearing ripe almonds
9  moses then brought out all the rods from before jehovah to all the people of israel
they looked at them and each man took his own rod
10  jehovah then said to moses put aarons rod back before the testimony as something to be kept for a sign to the sons of rebelliousness so that their murmurings against me may cease and so that they may not die
11  moses immediately did just as jehovah had commanded him
he did just so
12  the israelites then said to moses now we will die we will surely perish we are all going to perish
13  anyone who even comes close to jehovahs tabernacle will die must we end up dying that way
9  jehovah spoke to moses in the wilderness of siʹnai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of egypt saying
2  the israelites should prepare the passover sacrifice at its appointed time
3  on the 14th day of this month at twilight you should prepare it at its appointed time
according to all its statutes and all its set procedures you should prepare it
4  so moses told the israelites to prepare the passover sacrifice
5  then they prepared the passover sacrifice in the first month on the 14th day of the month at twilight in the wilderness of siʹnai
according to all that jehovah had commanded moses so the israelites did
6  now there were men who had become unclean by touching a dead body so that they were not able to prepare the passover sacrifice on that day
so those men presented themselves before moses and aaron on that day
7  and said to him we are unclean because of touching a dead body
why should we be kept from presenting the offering to jehovah at its appointed time among the israelites
8  at this moses said to them wait there and let me hear what jehovah may command regarding you
9  then jehovah said to moses
10  tell the israelites although any man among you or of your future generations should become unclean by touching a dead body or should be off on a distant journey he must still prepare the passover sacrifice to jehovah
11  they should prepare it in the second month on the 14th day at twilight
they should eat it together with unleavened bread and bitter greens
12  they must not let any of it remain until morning and they should not break any bone in it
they should prepare it according to every statute regarding the passover
13  but if a man was clean or was not off on a journey and neglected to prepare the passover sacrifice that person must then be cut off from his people because he did not present the offering of jehovah at its appointed time
that man will answer for his sin
14  and if a foreign resident is residing with you he should also prepare the passover sacrifice to jehovah
he should do so according to the statute of the passover and its set procedure
there should exist one statute for you both for the foreign resident and for the native of the land
15  now on the day the tabernacle was set up the cloud covered the tabernacle the tent of the testimony but in the evening what appeared to be fire remained over the tabernacle until morning
16  that is what continued to take place the cloud would cover it by day and the appearance of fire by night
17  whenever the cloud lifted from the tent the israelites would promptly depart and in the place where the cloud would remain there is where the israelites would encamp
18  at the order of jehovah the israelites would depart and at the order of jehovah they would encamp
as long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle they would remain encamped
19  when the cloud would stay over the tabernacle for many days the israelites would obey jehovah and not depart
20  sometimes the cloud would remain for a few days over the tabernacle
at the order of jehovah they would remain encamped and at the order of jehovah they would depart
21  sometimes the cloud would remain only from evening until morning and when the cloud lifted in the morning they would depart
whether it was day or night when the cloud lifted they would depart
22  whether it was two days a month or longer as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle the israelites remained encamped and would not depart
but when it lifted they would depart
23  at the order of jehovah they would encamp and at the order of jehovah they would depart
they kept their obligation to jehovah at the order of jehovah through moses
28  jehovah next said to moses
2  command the israelites and tell them you should take care that you present to me my offering my bread
my offerings by fire as a pleasing aroma to me must be made at their appointed times
3  and say to them this is the offering made by fire that you will present to jehovah two sound yearold male lambs a day as a burnt offering regularly
4  the one male lamb you will offer in the morning and the other male lamb you will offer at twilight
5  together with a tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil as a grain offering
6  it is a regular burnt offering which was established at mount siʹnai as a pleasing aroma an offering made by fire to jehovah
7  along with its drink offering a fourth of a hin for each male lamb
pour out the alcoholic drink in the holy place as a drink offering to jehovah
8  and you will offer the other male lamb at twilight
with the same grain offering as that made in the morning and with its same drink offering you will present it as an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to jehovah
9  however on the sabbath day the offering should be two sound yearold male lambs and two tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering together with its drink offering
10  this is the burnt offering for the sabbath along with the regular burnt offering and its drink offering
11  at the start of each month you will present as a burnt offering to jehovah two young bulls one ram and seven sound male lambs each a year old
12  and three tenth measures of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each bull and two tenth measures of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for the one ram
13  and a tenth measure of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each male lamb as a burnt offering a pleasing aroma an offering made by fire to jehovah
14  and their drink offerings should be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a male lamb
this is the monthly burnt offering each month throughout the year
15  also one young goat should be offered as a sin offering to jehovah in addition to the regular burnt offering together with its drink offering
16  in the first month on the 14th day of the month will be jehovahs passover
17  and on the 15th day of this month there will be a festival
unleavened bread will be eaten for seven days
18  on the first day there will be a holy convention
you must not do any hard work
19  and you will present as a burnt offering made by fire to jehovah two young bulls one ram and seven male lambs each a year old
you should offer sound animals
20  you should offer them with their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with oil three tenth measures for a bull and two tenth measures for the ram
21  you will offer a tenth measure respectively for each male lamb of the seven male lambs
22  as well as one goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you
23  aside from the morning burnt offering which is for the regular burnt offering you will offer these
24  you will offer these in the same manner each day for seven days as food an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to jehovah
it should be offered along with the regular burnt offering and its drink offering
25  on the seventh day you should hold a holy convention
you must not do any hard work
26  on the day of the first ripe fruits when you present a new grain offering to jehovah you should hold a holy convention in your feast of weeks
you must not do any hard work
27  you will present as a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to jehovah two young bulls one ram and seven male lambs each a year old
28  and as their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil three tenth measures for each bull two tenth measures for the one ram
29  a tenth measure respectively for each male lamb of the seven male lambs
30  as well as one young goat to make atonement for you
31  you will offer them in addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering
they should be sound animals along with their drink offerings
27  then the daughters of zeloʹphehad the son of heʹpher the son of gilʹead the son of maʹchir the son of manasʹseh of the families of manasʹseh the son of joseph approached
the names of his daughters were mahʹlah noah hogʹlah milʹcah and tirʹzah
2  they stood before moses eleaʹzar the priest the chieftains and all the assembly at the entrance of the tent of meeting and said
3  our father died in the wilderness but he was not among the group who banded together against jehovah the supporters of korʹah but he died for his own sin and he did not have any sons
4  why should the name of our father be lost from his family because he had no son give us a possession among our fathers brothers
5  so moses presented their case before jehovah
6  jehovah then said this to moses
7  the daughters of zeloʹphehad are correct
you should by all means give them the possession as an inheritance among their fathers brothers and transfer their fathers inheritance to them
8  and tell the israelites if a man dies without having a son you must then cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter
9  and if he has no daughter you will give his inheritance to his brothers
10  and if he has no brothers you will give his inheritance to his fathers brothers
11  and if his father has no brothers you will give his inheritance to the closest blood relative in his family and he will take possession of it
this will serve as a statute by judicial decision for the israelites just as jehovah has commanded moses
12  then jehovah said to moses go up into this mountain of abʹarim and view the land that i will give the israelites
13  when you have seen it you will also be gathered to your people just as aaron your brother was
14  because when the assembly was quarreling with me in the wilderness of zin you rebelled against my order to sanctify me before them by means of the waters
these are the waters of merʹibah at kaʹdesh in the wilderness of zin
15  then moses said to jehovah
16  let jehovah the god of the spirit of all people appoint over the assembly a man
17  who will go out and come in before them and who will lead them out and bring them in so that jehovahs assembly may not become like sheep that have no shepherd
18  so jehovah said to moses take joshua the son of nun a man in whom there is spirit and lay your hand on him
19  then stand him before eleaʹzar the priest and before all the assembly and you must commission him before their eyes
20  you are to confer some of your authority on him so that all the assembly of the israelites may listen to him
21  he will stand before eleaʹzar the priest who will inquire in his behalf by the judgment of the uʹrim before jehovah
at his order they will go out and at his order they will come in he and all the israelites with him and all the assembly
22  so moses did just as jehovah had commanded him
he took joshua and stood him before eleaʹzar the priest and before all the assembly
23  and he laid his hands on him and commissioned him just as jehovah had spoken through moses
7  on the day that moses finished setting up the tabernacle he anointed it and sanctified it together with all its furnishings the altar and all its utensils
when he had anointed and sanctified these things
2  the chieftains of israel the heads of their paternal houses made an offering
these chieftains of the tribes who presided over the registration
3  brought before jehovah their offering of six covered wagons and 12 oxen a wagon for two chieftains and a bull for each one and they presented them before the tabernacle
4  jehovah said to moses
5  accept these things from them as they will be used for the service of the tent of meeting and you should give them to the levites to each one as needed for his duties
6  so moses accepted the wagons and the cattle and gave them to the levites
7  he gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of gerʹshon according to what was needed for their duties
8  and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of merarʹi according to what was needed for their duties under the direction of ithʹamar the son of aaron the priest
9  but he did not give any to the sons of koʹhath because their duties involved the service of the holy place and they carried the holy things on their shoulders
10  now the chieftains made their presentation at the inauguration of the altar on the day it was anointed
when the chieftains presented their offering before the altar
11  jehovah said to moses one chieftain each day on successive days will present his offering for the inauguration of the altar
12  the one who presented his offering on the first day was nahʹshon the son of amminʹadab of the tribe of judah
13  his offering was one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering
14  one gold cup weighing 10 shekels full of incense
15  one young bull one ram and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering
16  one young goat for a sin offering
17  and for a communion sacrifice two cattle five rams five male goats and five male lambs each a year old
this was the offering of nahʹshon the son of amminʹadab
18  on the second day nethanʹel the son of zuʹar the chieftain of isʹsachar made a presentation
19  he presented as his offering one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering
20  one gold cup weighing 10 shekels full of incense
21  one young bull one ram and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering
22  one young goat for a sin offering
23  and for a communion sacrifice two cattle five rams five male goats and five male lambs each a year old
this was the offering of nethanʹel the son of zuʹar
24  on the third day the chieftain for the sons of zebʹulun eliʹab the son of heʹlon

89  whenever moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with god he would hear the voice conversing with him from above the cover of the ark of the testimony from between the two cherubs and god would speak to him
34  and jehovah spoke further to moses saying
2  give these instructions to the israelites when you go into the land of caʹnaan this is the land that will fall to you as an inheritance the land of caʹnaan according to its boundaries
3  your southern border will extend from the wilderness of zin alongside eʹdom and your south boundary on the east will be from the extremity of the salt sea
4  your boundary will change direction to pass south of the ascent of akrabʹbim and continue to zin and its end will be south of kaʹdeshbarʹnea
then it will extend to haʹzaradʹdar and continue to azʹmon
5  the boundary will change direction at azʹmon to the wadi of egypt and its end will be at the sea
6  your western boundary will be the great sea and the coast
this will become your western boundary
7  now this will be your northern boundary from the great sea you will mark your boundary out to mount hor
8  from mount hor you will mark out the boundary to leʹbohaʹmath and the end of the boundary will be at zeʹdad
9  and the boundary will extend to ziphʹron and its end will be haʹzareʹnan
this will become your northern boundary
10  then you should mark as your boundary on the east from haʹzareʹnan to sheʹpham
11  the boundary will extend from sheʹpham to ribʹlah to the east of aʹin and the border will go down and cross the eastern slope of the sea of chinʹnereth
12  the border will extend to the jordan and its end will be the salt sea
this will be your land and the boundaries surrounding it
13  so moses instructed the israelites saying this is the land that you will apportion as your possession by lot just as jehovah has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes
14  for the tribe of the reuʹbenites by their paternal house the tribe of the gadʹites by their paternal house and the half tribe of manasʹseh have already taken their inheritance
15  the two and a half tribes have already taken their inheritance east of the region of the jordan by jerʹicho toward the sunrising
16  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
17  these are the names of the men who will divide the land for you to possess eleaʹzar the priest and joshua the son of nun
18  and you will take one chieftain out of each tribe to divide the land as your inheritance
19  these are the names of the men of the tribe of judah caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh
20  of the tribe of the sons of simʹeon shemuʹel the son of ammiʹhud
21  of the tribe of benjamin eliʹdad the son of chisʹlon
22  of the tribe of the sons of dan a chieftain bukʹki the son of jogʹli
23  of the sons of joseph from the tribe of the sons of manasʹseh a chieftain hanʹniel the son of eʹphod
24  from the tribe of the sons of eʹphraim a chieftain kemuʹel the son of shiphʹtan
25  of the tribe of the sons of zebʹulun a chieftain elizaʹphan the son of parʹnach
26  of the tribe of the sons of isʹsachar a chieftain palʹtiel the son of azʹzan
27  of the tribe of the sons of ashʹer a chieftain ahiʹhud the son of sheloʹmi
28  of the tribe of the sons of naphʹtali a chieftain pedahʹel the son of ammiʹhud
29  these are the ones whom jehovah commanded to distribute the land to the israelites in the land of caʹnaan
23  then baʹlaam said to baʹlak build on this spot seven altars and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me
2  baʹlak immediately did just as baʹlaam had said
and baʹlak and baʹlaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar
3  baʹlaam then said to baʹlak stay here by your burnt offering and i will go
perhaps jehovah will get in touch with me
whatever he reveals to me i will tell you
so he went to a barren hill
4  then god got in touch with baʹlaam who said to him i set the seven altars in rows and i offered up a bull and a ram on each altar
5  jehovah put this word in the mouth of baʹlaam return to baʹlak and this is what you are to say
6  so he returned and saw that baʹlak and all the princes of moʹab were standing by his burnt offering
7  then he spoke this proverbial saying baʹlak the king of moʹab has brought me from aʹramfrom the mountains of the east do come to curse jacob for me
yes come to denounce israel
8  how could i put a curse on those whom god has not cursed and how could i denounce those whom jehovah has not denounced
9  from the top of the rocks i see themand from the hills i see them
as a people they dwell there alonethey do not count themselves among the nations
10  who can number the dust particles of jacobor count even the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the uprightand let my end be like theirs
11  baʹlak then said to baʹlaam what have you done to me i brought you to put a curse on my enemies and here you have done nothing but bless them
12  he answered must i not speak whatever jehovah puts in my mouth
13  baʹlak said to him please come with me to another place from which you can see them
you will see only a part of them you will not see them all
put a curse on them for me from there
14  so he took him to the field of zoʹphim to the top of pisʹgah and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar
15  so baʹlaam said to baʹlak stay here by your burnt offering while i get in touch with him over there
16  and jehovah got in touch with baʹlaam and put this word in his mouth return to baʹlak and this is what you are to say
17  so he came to him and saw that he was waiting by his burnt offering and the princes of moʹab were with him
baʹlak asked him what has jehovah said
18  then he spoke this proverbial saying get up baʹlak and listen
hear me o son of zipʹpor
19  god is not a mere man who tells liesnor a son of man who changes his mind
when he says something will he not do it when he speaks will he not carry it out
20  look i have been taken to blessnow he has blessed and i cannot reverse it
21  he does not tolerate any magical power against jacoband he does not allow any trouble against israel
jehovah his god is with themand he is loudly hailed as king among them
22  god is bringing them out of egypt
he is like the horns of a wild bull for them
23  for there are no omens of doom against jacobnor any divination against israel
at this time it may be said about jacob and israel look at what god has done
24  here is a people who will rise up like a lionand like the lion it will raise itself up
it will not lie down until it eats preyand drinks the blood of the slain ones
25  baʹlak then said to baʹlaam if on the one hand you cannot put any curse on him then on the other hand you should not bless him either
26  baʹlaam answered baʹlak did i not say to you i will do all that jehovah says
27  baʹlak said to baʹlaam please come and let me take you to yet another place
perhaps it will be right in the eyes of the true god for you to put a curse on him for me from there
28  so baʹlak took baʹlaam to the top of peʹor which looks toward jeshiʹmon
29  then baʹlaam said to baʹlak build seven altars on this spot and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me
30  so baʹlak did just as baʹlaam had said and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar
22  then the israelites departed and camped on the desert plains of moʹab across the jordan from jerʹicho
2  now baʹlak the son of zipʹpor saw all that israel had done to the amʹorites
3  and moʹab became very frightened of the people because they were so many indeed moʹab felt sick with fear because of the israelites
4  so moʹab said to the elders of midʹian now this congregation will devour all our surroundings just as a bull devours the grass in the field
baʹlak the son of zipʹpor was king of moʹab at that time
5  he sent messengers to baʹlaam the son of beʹor at peʹthor which is by the river in his native land
he summoned him saying look a people has come out of egypt
look they have covered the face of the earth and they are dwelling right in front of me
6  now please come and curse this people for me for they are mightier than i am
perhaps i can defeat them and drive them out of the land for i well know that the one whom you bless is blessed and the one whom you curse is cursed
7  so the elders of moʹab and the elders of midʹian traveled with the fee for divination in their hands and went to baʹlaam and conveyed to him baʹlaks message
8  at that he said to them spend the night here and i will bring back to you whatever word jehovah speaks to me
so the princes of moʹab stayed with baʹlaam
9  then god came to baʹlaam and said who are these men with you
10  baʹlaam said to the true god baʹlak the son of zipʹpor the king of moʹab has sent me a message saying
11  look the people who are coming out of egypt are covering the face of the earth
now come and put a curse on them for me
perhaps i may be able to fight against them and drive them out
12  but god said to baʹlaam you must not go with them
you must not curse the people for they are blessed
13  baʹlaam got up in the morning and said to the princes of baʹlak go to your land for jehovah has refused to let me go with you
14  so the princes of moʹab departed and returned to baʹlak and said baʹlaam has refused to come with us
15  however baʹlak again sent princes more numerous and more distinguished than the first group
16  they came to baʹlaam and said to him this is what baʹlak the son of zipʹpor has said please do not let anything hinder you from coming to me
17  for i will honor you greatly and i will do anything you tell me to do
so come please and curse this people for me
18  but baʹlaam answered the servants of baʹlak if baʹlak were to give me his own house full of silver and gold i could not do anything beyond the order of jehovah my god whether small or great
19  but please stay here tonight also so that i may learn what else jehovah will tell me
20  then god came to baʹlaam by night and said to him if these men have come to summon you go along with them
but you may speak only the words that i tell you to say
21  so baʹlaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of moʹab
22  but gods anger blazed because he was going and jehovahs angel stationed himself in the road to resist him
now baʹlaam was riding on his donkey and two of his attendants were with him
23  and when the donkey saw jehovahs angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand it tried to turn off the road into the field
but baʹlaam began to beat the donkey to make it return to the road
24  then jehovahs angel stood in a narrow path between two vineyards with stone walls on both sides
25  when the donkey saw jehovahs angel it began to squeeze itself against the wall and it jammed baʹlaams foot against the wall and baʹlaam began beating it again
26  jehovahs angel now passed by again and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left
27  when the donkey saw jehovahs angel it lay down under baʹlaam so baʹlaam became furious and kept beating the donkey with his staff
28  finally jehovah caused the donkey to speak and it said to baʹlaam what have i done to you to make you beat me these three times
29  baʹlaam replied to the donkey it is because you have made a fool of me
if only i had a sword in my hand i would kill you
30  then the donkey said to baʹlaam am i not your donkey that you have ridden on all your life until today have i ever treated you this way before he replied no
31  then jehovah uncovered baʹlaams eyes and he saw jehovahs angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand
at once he bowed low and prostrated himself on his face
32  then jehovahs angel said to him why have you beaten your donkey these three times look i myself came out to offer resistance because your way is in defiance of my will
33  the donkey saw me and tried to turn away from me these three times
supposing it had not turned away from me by now i would have killed you and let the donkey live
34  baʹlaam said to jehovahs angel i have sinned because i did not know that it was you standing in the road to meet me
and now if it is bad in your eyes i will go back
35  but jehovahs angel said to baʹlaam go with the men but you may speak only the words that i tell you
so baʹlaam continued going with the princes of baʹlak
36  when baʹlak heard that baʹlaam had come he immediately went out to meet him at the city of moʹab which is on the bank of the arʹnon on the border of the territory
37  baʹlak said to baʹlaam did i not send for you why did you not come to me did you think i am not able to honor you greatly
38  baʹlaam replied to baʹlak well i have come to you now
but will i be allowed to say anything i can only speak words that god puts in my mouth
39  so baʹlaam went with baʹlak and they came to kirʹiathhuʹzoth
40  baʹlak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to baʹlaam and the princes who were with him
41  in the morning baʹlak took baʹlaam and brought him up to baʹmothbaʹal from there he could see all the people
32  now the sons of reuʹben and the sons of gad had very large quantities of livestock and they saw that the lands of jaʹzer and gilʹead were a good region for livestock
2  so the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben approached moses eleaʹzar the priest and the chieftains of the assembly and said
3  atʹaroth diʹbon jaʹzer nimʹrah heshʹbon eleaʹleh seʹbam neʹbo and beʹon
4  the land that jehovah defeated before the assembly of israel is a good land for livestock and your servants have much livestock
5  they continued if we have found favor in your eyes let this be the land given to your servants as a possession
do not make us cross the jordan
6  then moses said to the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben are your brothers to go to war while you yourselves keep dwelling here
7  why should you discourage the people of israel from crossing into the land that jehovah is certain to give them
8  that is what your fathers did when i sent them from kaʹdeshbarʹnea to see the land
9  when they went up to the valley of eshʹcol and saw the land they discouraged the people of israel from going into the land that jehovah was to give them
10  jehovahs anger blazed on that day so that he swore
11  the men who came up out of egypt from 20 years old and up will not see the land of which i have sworn to abraham isaac and jacob because they have not followed me wholeheartedly
12  except caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh the kenʹizzite and joshua the son of nun because they have followed jehovah wholeheartedly
13  so jehovahs anger blazed against israel and he made them wander about in the wilderness for 40 years until all the generation that was doing evil in the eyes of jehovah came to its end
14  now here you have risen in the place of your fathers as a brood of sinful men who increase the burning anger of jehovah against israel
15  if you turn back from following him he will certainly leave them again in the wilderness and you will bring ruin to all this people
16  they later approached him and said let us build here stone pens for our livestock and cities for our children
17  but we will continue ready for battle and will go before the israelites until we have brought them to their place while our children will dwell in the fortified cities safe from the inhabitants of the land
18  we will not return to our houses until each of the israelites has received his land as an inheritance
19  for we will not receive an inheritance with them on the other side of the jordan and beyond because we have received our inheritance on the east side of the jordan
20  moses replied to them if you will do this take up arms before jehovah for the war
21  and if every one of you takes up arms and crosses the jordan before jehovah as he drives away his enemies from before him
22  until the land is subdued before jehovah afterward you may return and be free from guilt before jehovah and israel
then this land will become your possession before jehovah
23  but if you do not do this you will have sinned against jehovah
in that case know that your sin will catch up with you
24  so you may build cities for your children and pens for your flocks but you must do what you have promised
25  the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben said this to moses your servants will do just as my lord is commanding
26  our children our wives our livestock and all our domestic animals will stay there in the cities of gilʹead
27  but your servants will cross over every man armed for battle to wage war before jehovah just as my lord is speaking
28  so moses gave a command concerning them to eleaʹzar the priest to joshua the son of nun and to the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of israel
29  moses said to them if the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben cross over the jordan with you every man armed for the war before jehovah and the land is subdued before you you will then give them the land of gilʹead as a possession
30  but if they do not take up arms and cross over with you they will then settle among you in the land of caʹnaan
31  to this the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben answered what jehovah has spoken to your servants is what we will do
32  we will take up arms and cross over before jehovah to the land of caʹnaan but the possession we are to inherit will be on this side of the jordan
33  so moses gave to themto the sons of gad the sons of reuʹben and to the half tribe of manasʹseh the son of josephthe kingdom of siʹhon the king of the amʹorites and the kingdom of og the king of baʹshan the land belonging to its cities in those territories and the cities of the surrounding land
34  and the sons of gad built diʹbon atʹaroth aroʹer
35  atʹrothshoʹphan jaʹzer jogʹbehah
36  bethnimʹrah and bethhaʹran fortified cities and they built stone pens for the flocks
37  and the sons of reuʹben built heshʹbon eleaʹleh kiriathaʹim
38  neʹbo and baʹalmeʹontheir names being changedand sibʹmah and they began to rename the cities that they rebuilt
39  the sons of maʹchir the son of manasʹseh marched against gilʹead and captured it and drove away the amʹorites who were in it
40  so moses gave gilʹead to maʹchir the son of manasʹseh and he began dwelling in it
41  and jaʹir the son of manasʹseh marched against them and captured their tent villages and he began to call them havʹvothjaʹir
42  and noʹbah marched against and captured keʹnath and its dependent towns and he began to call it noʹbah by his own name
6  jehovah spoke further to moses and said
2  speak to the israelites and tell them if a man or a woman takes a special vow to live as a nazʹirite to jehovah
3  he should keep away from wine and other alcoholic beverages
he should not drink the vinegar of wine or the vinegar of anything alcoholic
he should not drink any liquid made from grapes nor eat grapes whether fresh or dried
4  all the days of his naziriteship he should not eat anything made from the grapevine from the unripe grapes to the skins
5  all the days of the vow of his naziriteship no razor should pass over his head
he is to remain holy by letting the hair of his head grow until the days of his being set apart to jehovah are completed
6  he should not approach a dead person during all the days he remains separated to jehovah
7  even if his father or his mother or his brother or his sister should die he may not defile himself because the sign of his naziriteship to his god is upon his head
8  he is holy to jehovah all the days of his naziriteship
9  but if someone should suddenly die alongside him and he defiles the hair symbolizing his separation to god he must shave his head on the day he establishes his purification
he should shave it on the seventh day
10  and on the eighth day he should bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting
11  the priest will prepare one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering and make atonement for him for his sin in connection with the dead person
then he must sanctify his head on that day
12  and he must separate himself again to jehovah for the days of his naziriteship and he will bring a young ram in its first year as a guilt offering
however the former days will go uncounted because he defiled his naziriteship
13  now this is the law about the nazʹirite when he completes the days of his naziriteship he will be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting
14  there he must present his offering to jehovah one sound young ram in its first year as a burnt offering one sound female lamb in its first year as a sin offering one sound ram as a communion sacrifice
15  a basket of unleavened ringshaped loaves of fine flour mixed with oil unleavened wafers smeared with oil and their grain offering and their drink offerings
16  the priest will present them before jehovah and will offer up his sin offering and his burnt offering
17  he will offer the ram as a communion sacrifice to jehovah along with the basket of unleavened loaves and the priest will present its grain offering and its drink offering
18  the nazʹirite must then shave the uncut hair of his head at the entrance of the tent of meeting and he will take the hair of his head grown during his naziriteship and put it on the fire that is under the communion sacrifice
19  and the priest must take a boiled shoulder from the ram one unleavened ringshaped loaf from the basket and one unleavened wafer and put them on the palms of the nazʹirite after he has had the sign of his naziriteship shaved off
20  and the priest must wave them back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah
it is something holy for the priest along with the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the contribution
afterward the nazʹirite may drink wine
21  this is the law about the nazʹirite who makes a vow if he vows and can afford to make an offering to jehovah that is beyond the requirements of his naziriteship he must then carry out his vow out of regard for the law of his naziriteship
22  then jehovah said to moses
23  tell aaron and his sons this is the way you should bless the people of israel
say to them
24  may jehovah bless you and safeguard you
25  may jehovah make his face shine upon you and may he favor you
26  may jehovah lift up his face toward you and grant you peace
27  and they must place my name upon the people of israel that i may bless them
31  jehovah then told moses
2  take vengeance for the israelites on the midʹianites
afterward you will be gathered to your people
3  so moses spoke to the people saying equip men from among you for battle against midʹian and to execute jehovahs vengeance on midʹian
4  you should send 1000 of each tribe of all the tribes of israel into the army
5  so from the thousands of israel 1000 were assigned from each tribe 12000 equipped for battle
6  then moses sent them out 1000 from each tribe to the army along with phinʹehas the son of eleaʹzar the priest for the army who had the holy utensils and the signal trumpets in his hand
7  they waged war against midʹian just as jehovah had commanded moses and they killed every male
8  along with the others slain they killed the kings of midʹian namely eʹvi reʹkem zur hur and reʹba the five kings of midʹian
they also killed baʹlaam the son of beʹor with the sword
9  but the israelites carried off captive the women and children of midʹian
they also plundered all their domestic animals all their livestock and all their possessions
10  and all their cities in which they had settled and all their encampments they burned with fire
11  and they took all the spoil and all the plunder both humans and animals
12  then they brought the captives the plunder and the spoil to moses and eleaʹzar the priest and to the assembly of the israelites to the camp in the desert plains of moʹab near the jordan at jerʹicho
13  then moses and eleaʹzar the priest and all the chieftains of the assembly went out to meet them outside the camp
14  but moses grew indignant at the appointed men of the combat forces the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds who were coming in from the military expedition
15  moses said to them have you preserved all the females alive
16  look they are the ones who by baʹlaams word induced the israelites to commit unfaithfulness toward jehovah over the affair of peʹor so that the scourge came upon the assembly of jehovah
17  now you should kill every male among the children and kill every woman who has had sexual relations with a man
18  but you may keep alive all the young girls who have not had sexual relations with a man
19  and you should camp outside the camp seven days
every one of you who has killed someone and every one of you who has touched someone slain should purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day you and your captives
20  and you should purify from sin every garment every article of skin everything made of goat hair and every article of wood
21  eleaʹzar the priest then said to the men of the army who had gone into the battle this is the statute of the law that jehovah commanded moses
22  only the gold the silver the copper the iron the tin and the lead
23  everything that can be processed with fire you should pass through the fire and it will be clean
however it should also be purified by the water for cleansing
everything that cannot be processed with fire you should pass through the water
24  and you should wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean and then you may come into the camp
25  jehovah then said this to moses
26  take an inventory of the plunder counting the captives both of humans and animals do this together with eleaʹzar the priest and the heads of the paternal houses of the assembly
27  divide what was plundered into two parts to be shared between those in the army who took part in the battle and all the rest of the assembly
28  as a tax for jehovah you should take from the soldiers who went out into the battle one soul out of every 500 of the people the herd the donkeys and the flock
29  you should take it from their half and give it to eleaʹzar the priest as jehovahs contribution
30  from the half given to the israelites you should take one out of 50 of the people the herd the donkeys the flock and every sort of domestic animal and give them to the levites who care for the responsibilities connected with jehovahs tabernacle
31  so moses and eleaʹzar the priest did just as jehovah had commanded moses
32  the spoils the rest of the plunder that the people of the expedition had taken amounted to 675000 of the flock
33  72000 of the herd
34  and 61000 donkeys
35  the women who had not had sexual relations with a man amounted to 32000 women
36  the half that was the share of those who went out into the battle amounted to 337500 of the flock
37  the tax for jehovah from the flock amounted to 675
38  and there were 36000 of the herd and the tax on them for jehovah was 72
39  and there were 30500 donkeys and the tax on them for jehovah was 61
40  and there were 16000 humans and the tax on them for jehovah was 32 persons
41  then moses gave the tax as jehovahs contribution to eleaʹzar the priest just as jehovah had commanded moses
42  from the half belonging to the israelites which moses had divided off from the portion that belonged to the men who waged war
43  that half of the flock amounted to 337500
44  and of the herd 36000
45  and of the donkeys 30500
46  and of the people 16000
47  then moses took from the half belonging to the israelites one out of 50 of the people and of the animals and gave them to the levites who cared for the responsibility of jehovahs tabernacle just as jehovah had commanded moses
48  then the appointed men who were of the thousands of the army the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds approached moses
49  and they said to moses your servants have taken the count of the men of war who are under our command and not one has been reported missing from us
50  so let us each present what he has found as jehovahs offering articles of gold ankle chains bracelets signet rings earrings and other jewelry in order to make atonement for ourselves before jehovah
51  so moses and eleaʹzar the priest accepted the gold from them all the jewelry
52  all the gold of the contribution that they made to jehovah amounted to 16750 shekels from the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds
53  the men of the army had each taken plunder for himself
54  moses and eleaʹzar the priest accepted the gold from the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a reminder for the people of israel before jehovah
21  when the caʹnaanite king of aʹrad who dwelled in the negʹeb heard that israel had come by the way of athʹarim he attacked israel and carried away some of them as captives
2  so israel made this vow to jehovah if you give this people into my hand i will without fail devote their cities to destruction
3  so jehovah listened to israels voice and gave the caʹnaanites over to them and they devoted them and their cities to destruction
therefore they named the place horʹmah
4  as they continued their journey from mount hor by the way of the red sea in order to go around the land of eʹdom the people became weary of the journey
5  and the people kept speaking against god and moses saying why have you brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness there is no food and no water and we have come to hate this contemptible bread
6  so jehovah sent poisonous serpents among the people and they kept biting the people so that many israelites died
7  so the people came to moses and said we have sinned by speaking against jehovah and against you
intercede with jehovah so that he may remove the serpents from us
and moses interceded on behalf of the people
8  then jehovah said to moses make a replica of a poisonous snake and put it on a pole
then when anyone has been bitten he will have to look at it in order to keep alive
9  moses at once made a serpent of copper and put it on the pole and whenever a serpent had bitten a man and he looked at the copper serpent he survived
10  after that the israelites departed and camped in oʹboth
11  then they departed from oʹboth and camped in iʹyeabʹarim in the wilderness that faces moʹab toward the east
12  from there they departed and camped by the valley of zeʹred
13  from there they departed and camped in the region of the arʹnon which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the amʹorites for the arʹnon is the boundary of moʹab between moʹab and the amʹorites
14  that is why the book of the wars of jehovah speaks of vaʹheb in suʹphah and the valleys of arʹnon
15  and the descent of the valleys which extends toward the settlement of ar and adjoins the border of moʹab
16  next they went on to beʹer
this is the well about which jehovah said to moses gather the people and let me give them water
17  at that time israel sang this song spring up o wellrespond to it
18  the well that princes dug that nobles of the people excavatedwith a commanders staff and with their own staffs
then they went from the wilderness on to matʹtanah
19  from matʹtanah on to nahalʹiel and from nahalʹiel on to baʹmoth
20  they went from baʹmoth on to the valley that is in the territory of moʹab on top of pisʹgah which overlooks jeshiʹmon
21  israel now sent messengers to siʹhon the king of the amʹorites saying
22  let us pass through your land
we will not turn aside into a field or a vineyard
we will not drink water from any well
we will march on the kings road until we pass through your territory
23  but siʹhon did not allow israel to pass through his territory
instead siʹhon gathered all his people and went out against israel in the wilderness and came to jaʹhaz and began fighting with israel
24  but israel defeated him with the sword and took possession of his land from the arʹnon to the jabʹbok near the amʹmonites because jaʹzer borders the territory of the amʹmonites
25  so israel took all these cities and they began dwelling in all the cities of the amʹorites in heshʹbon and all its dependent towns
26  for heshʹbon was the city of siʹhon the king of the amʹorites who had fought with the king of moʹab and taken all his land from him as far as the arʹnon
27  that is what gave rise to the taunting proverbial saying come to heshʹbon
let the city of siʹhon be built and firmly established
28  for a fire came out of heshʹbon a flame from the town of siʹhon
it has consumed ar of moʹab the lords of the high places of the arʹnon
29  woe to you moʹab you will be destroyed o people of cheʹmosh he makes his sons fugitives and his daughters captives of siʹhon the king of the amʹorites
30  let us shoot at themheshʹbon will be destroyed as far as diʹbonlet us desolate it as far as noʹphahfire will spread as far as medʹeba
31  so israel began to dwell in the land of the amʹorites
32  moses then sent some men to spy on jaʹzer
they captured its dependent towns and drove out the amʹorites who were there
33  after that they turned and went up by way of baʹshan
and og the king of baʹshan came out with all his people to meet them in battle at edʹrei
34  jehovah said to moses do not be afraid of him for i will give him and all his people and his land into your hand and you will do to him just as you did to siʹhon the king of the amʹorites who lived in heshʹbon
35  so they kept striking him down along with his sons and all his people until none of his people survived and they took possession of his land
25  when israel was dwelling in shitʹtim the people started to commit sexual immorality with the daughters of moʹab
2  the women invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods and the people began to eat and to bow down to their gods
3  so israel joined in worship of the baʹal of peʹor and jehovah became enraged with israel
4  jehovah said to moses take all the leaders of these people and hang them up before jehovah in broad daylight that the burning anger of jehovah may turn back from israel
5  then moses said to the judges of israel each one of you should kill his men who joined in worship of the baʹal of peʹor
6  but just then there came one of the israelites bringing near to his brothers a midʹianite woman before the eyes of moses and of all the assembly of the israelites while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting
7  when phinʹehas the son of eleaʹzar the son of aaron the priest saw it he immediately rose up from the midst of the assembly and took a spear in his hand
8  then he went after the man of israel into the tent and pierced both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her genital parts
at that the scourge on the israelites was halted
9  those who died from the scourge amounted to 24000
10  then jehovah said to moses
11  phinʹehas the son of eleaʹzar the son of aaron the priest has turned my wrath away from the people of israel because he tolerated no rivalry at all toward me among them
so i have not exterminated the israelites in my insistence on exclusive devotion
12  therefore say i am giving him my covenant of peace
13  and it will serve as the covenant of a lasting priesthood for him and his offspring after him because he tolerated no rivalry toward his god and he made atonement for the people of israel
14  incidentally the name of the israelite man who was put to death along with the midʹianitess was zimʹri the son of saʹlu a chieftain of a paternal house of the simʹeonites
15  the name of the midʹianite woman who was put to death was cozʹbi the daughter of zur he was a leader of the clans of a paternal house in midʹian
16  jehovah later said to moses
17  harass the midʹianites and strike them down
18  because they have been harassing you with their cunning dealings against you in the affair of peʹor and of cozʹbi the daughter of a chieftain of midʹian their sister who was put to death in the day of the scourge over the affair of peʹor
13  jehovah now spoke to moses saying
2  send out men to spy out the land of caʹnaan which i am giving to the israelites
you are to send out one man from each ancestral tribe each one a chieftain among them
3  so moses sent them out from the wilderness of paʹran at the order of jehovah
all the men were heads of the israelites
4  these are their names of the tribe of reuʹben shammuʹa the son of zacʹcur
5  of the tribe of simʹeon shaʹphat the son of hoʹri
6  of the tribe of judah caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh
7  of the tribe of isʹsachar iʹgal the son of joseph
8  of the tribe of eʹphraim hosheʹa the son of nun
9  of the tribe of benjamin palʹti the son of raʹphu
10  of the tribe of zebʹulun gadʹdiel the son of soʹdi
11  of the tribe of joseph for the tribe of manasʹseh gadʹdi the son of suʹsi
12  of the tribe of dan amʹmiel the son of gemalʹli
13  of the tribe of ashʹer seʹthur the son of miʹchael
14  of the tribe of naphʹtali nahʹbi the son of vophʹsi
15  of the tribe of gad geuʹel the son of maʹchi
16  these are the names of the men whom moses sent to spy out the land
and moses gave the name joshua to hosheʹa the son of nun
17  when moses was sending them to spy out the land of caʹnaan he said to them go up there into the negʹeb and then go up into the mountainous region
18  you must see what kind of land it is and whether the people who are dwelling in it are strong or weak few or many
19  and whether the land is good or bad and whether the cities they are dwelling in are encampments or fortifications
20  and find out whether the land is rich or poor and whether there are trees in it or not
you must be courageous and take some of the fruitage of the land
now it was the season of the first ripe grapes
21  so they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of zin to reʹhob to leʹbohaʹmath
22  when they went up into the negʹeb they came to hebʹron where ahiʹman sheʹshai and talʹmai the anʹakim were living
incidentally hebʹron had been built seven years before zoʹan of egypt
23  when they came to the valley of eshʹcol there they cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes which two of the men had to carry on a bar as well as some of the pomegranates and figs
24  they called that place the valley of eshʹcol because of the cluster that the israelites cut down from there
25  at the end of 40 days they returned from spying out the land
26  so they came back to moses and aaron and all the assembly of the israelites in the wilderness of paʹran at kaʹdesh
they brought back a report to all the assembly and showed them the fruitage of the land
27  this is what they reported to moses we entered the land into which you sent us and it is indeed flowing with milk and honey and this is its fruitage
28  nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong and the fortified cities are very great
we also saw the anʹakim there
29  the amalʹekites are dwelling in the land of the negʹeb and the hitʹtites the jebʹusites and the amʹorites are dwelling in the mountainous region and the caʹnaanites are dwelling by the sea and along the jordan
30  then caʹleb tried to calm the people as they stood before moses by saying let us go up immediately and we are sure to take possession of it because we can surely conquer it
31  but the men who went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people because they are stronger than we are
32  and they kept on giving the israelites a bad report about the land that they had spied out saying the land that we passed through to spy out is a land that devours its inhabitants and all the people whom we saw in it are men of extraordinary size
33  and there we saw the nephʹilim the sons of aʹnak who are from the nephʹilim and in comparison we seemed like grasshoppers both to us and to them
14  then all the assembly raised their voice and the people continued crying out and weeping all through that night
2  all the israelites began to murmur against moses and aaron and the whole assembly spoke against them saying if only we had died in the land of egypt or if only we had died in this wilderness
3  why is jehovah bringing us to this land to fall by the sword our wives and children will become plunder
is it not better for us to return to egypt
4  they were even saying to one another let us appoint a leader and return to egypt
5  at this moses and aaron fell with their faces to the ground before the whole assembled congregation of the israelites
6  joshua the son of nun and caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh who were among those who spied out the land ripped their garments apart
7  and they said this to all the assembly of the israelites the land that we passed through to spy out is a very very good land
8  if jehovah is pleased with us he will certainly bring us into this land and give it to us a land that is flowing with milk and honey
9  but you must not rebel against jehovah and you must not fear the people of the land for we will devour them
their protection has been removed from them and jehovah is with us
do not fear them
10  however all the assembly talked of stoning them
but jehovahs glory appeared on the tent of meeting to all the people of israel
11  then jehovah said to moses how much longer will this people treat me without respect and how much longer will they not put faith in me in spite of all the signs that i performed among them
12  let me strike them with pestilence and drive them away and let me make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are
13  but moses said to jehovah then the egyptians from whose midst you brought this people out by your power will hear
14  and they will speak about it to the inhabitants of this land
these also have heard that you jehovah are among this people and have appeared to them facetoface
you are jehovah and your cloud is standing over them and you are going before them in the pillar of cloud by day and in the pillar of fire by night
15  if you put this people to death all at once the nations who have heard of your fame would say this
16  jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them so he slaughtered them in the wilderness
17  please now jehovah let your power be great as you promised when you said
18  jehovah slow to anger and abundant in loyal love pardoning error and transgression but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation
19  forgive please the error of this people according to your great loyal love just as you have pardoned this people from egypt until now
20  then jehovah said i forgive them according to your word
21  but on the other hand as surely as i live all the earth will be filled with the glory of jehovah
22  however not one of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that i performed in egypt and in the wilderness and yet have kept testing me these ten times and have not listened to my voice
23  will ever see the land about which i swore to their fathers
no not one of those treating me without respect will see it
24  but because my servant caʹleb had a different spirit and kept following after me wholeheartedly i will certainly bring him into the land where he went and his offspring will take possession of it
25  since the amalʹekites and the caʹnaanites are dwelling in the valley you should turn back tomorrow and set off for the wilderness by the way of the red sea
26  jehovah then said to moses and aaron
27  how much longer will this evil assembly keep up this murmuring against me i have heard what the israelites are murmuring against me
28  say to them as surely as i live declares jehovah i will do to you just what i have heard you speak
29  in this wilderness your corpses will fall yes the whole number of you from 20 years old and up who were registered all of you who have murmured against me
30  none of you will enter into the land that i swore to have you reside in except caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh and joshua the son of nun
31  and i will bring in your children who you said would become plunder and they will get to know the land that you have rejected
32  but your own corpses will fall in this wilderness
33  now your sons will become shepherds in the wilderness 40 years and they will have to answer for your acts of unfaithfulness until the last one of your corpses falls in the wilderness
34  according to the number of the days that you spied out the land 40 days a day for a year a day for a year you will answer for your errors 40 years for you will know what it means to oppose me
35  i jehovah have spoken
this is what i will do to all this evil assembly those who have gathered together against me in this wilderness they will come to their end and here they will die
36  the men whom moses sent to spy out the land and who caused the whole assembly to murmur against him when they returned with a bad report about the land
37  yes the men who brought back the bad report about the land will be struck down and die before jehovah
38  but joshua the son of nun and caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh who were among those who went to spy out the land will certainly keep living
39  when moses spoke these words to all the israelites the people began to mourn a great deal
40  moreover they got up early in the morning and tried to go up to the top of the mountain saying here we are ready to go up to the place that jehovah spoke about for we have sinned
41  but moses said why are you going beyond the order of jehovah this will not succeed
42  do not go up for jehovah is not with you and you will be defeated by your enemies
43  for the amalʹekites and the caʹnaanites are there to face you and you will fall by the sword
because you turned away from following jehovah jehovah will not be with you
44  however they presumptuously went toward the top of the mountain but the ark of jehovahs covenant and moses did not move away from the middle of the camp
45  then the amalʹekites and the caʹnaanites who were dwelling in that mountain came down and struck them scattering them as far as horʹmah
29  and in the seventh month on the first of the month you should hold a holy convention

39  these you will offer to jehovah at your seasonal festivals in addition to your vow offerings and your voluntary offerings as your burnt offerings and your grain offerings and your drink offerings and your communion sacrifices
40  moses told the israelites everything that jehovah had commanded him
19  jehovah spoke again to moses and aaron saying
2  this is a statute of the law that jehovah has commanded tell the israelites that they should take for you a sound red cow in which there is no defect and upon which no yoke has come
3  you are to give it to eleaʹzar the priest and he will lead it outside the camp and it will be slaughtered before him
4  then eleaʹzar the priest will take some of its blood with his finger and spatter its blood seven times straight toward the front of the tent of meeting
5  the cow will then be burned before his eyes
its skin and its flesh and its blood together with its dung will be burned
6  and the priest will take cedarwood hyssop and scarlet material and throw them into the fire where the cow is being burned
7  the priest will then wash his garments and bathe himself in water and afterward he may come into the camp but the priest will be unclean until the evening
8  the one who burned the cow will wash his garments in water and bathe himself in water and he will be unclean until the evening
9  a clean man will gather up the ashes of the cow and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place and they should be kept by the assembly of the israelites to prepare water that will be used for cleansing
it is a sin offering
10  the one gathering the ashes of the cow will wash his garments and be unclean until the evening
this will serve the israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst as a lasting statute
11  anyone touching any dead person will be unclean for seven days
12  such one should purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day he will be clean
but if he does not purify himself on the third day on the seventh day he will not be clean
13  everyone who touches the corpse of any dead person and does not purify himself has defiled jehovahs tabernacle and that person must be cut off from israel
because the water for cleansing has not been sprinkled on him he continues unclean
his uncleanness remains upon him
14  this is the law that applies when a man dies in a tent everyone who enters the tent and everyone who was already in the tent will be unclean for seven days
15  every opened container with no lid tied on it is unclean
16  everyone in the open field who touches someone killed with the sword or a corpse or the bone of a man or a burial place will be unclean for seven days
17  they should take for the unclean one some of the ashes of the sin offering that was burned and pour running water on them in a container
18  then a clean man will take hyssop and dip it into the water and spatter it on the tent and on all the containers and on the people who were there and on the one who touched the bone or the slain one or the corpse or the burial place
19  the clean person will spatter it on the unclean one on the third day and on the seventh day and he will purify him from sin on the seventh day then he should wash his garments and bathe in water and he will become clean in the evening
20  but the man who is unclean and who will not purify himself that person must be cut off from the congregation because he has defiled jehovahs sanctuary
the water for cleansing was not sprinkled on him so he is unclean
21  this will serve as a lasting statute for them the one spattering the water for cleansing should wash his garments and the one touching the water for cleansing will be unclean until the evening
22  anything the unclean one touches will be unclean and the person who touches it will be unclean until the evening
24  when baʹlaam saw that it pleased jehovah to bless israel he did not go away again to search for omens of doom but he turned his face to the wilderness
2  when baʹlaam raised his eyes and saw israel encamped by his tribes then the spirit of god came upon him
3  he then spoke this proverbial saying the saying of baʹlaam the son of beʹorand the saying of a man whose eyes have been opened
4  the saying of the one hearing the word of godwho saw a vision of the almightywho has bowed down with his eyes uncovered
5  how beautiful are your tents o jacobyour tabernacles o israel
6  like the valleys they have extended a long waylike gardens by the riverlike aloes that jehovah has plantedlike cedars by the waters
7  water keeps trickling from his two leather bucketsand his seed is sown by many waters
his king also will be greater than aʹgagand his kingdom will be exalted
8  god is bringing him out of egypthe is like the horns of a wild bull for them
he will consume the nations his oppressorsand their bones he will gnaw and he will shatter them with his arrows
9  he has crouched down he has lain down like the lionand like a lion who dares rouse him those blessing you are blessedand those cursing you are cursed
10  then baʹlak became furious with baʹlaam
baʹlak scornfully clapped his hands together and said to baʹlaam it was to put a curse on my enemies that i called you but now you have done nothing but bless them these three times
11  now go home immediately
i intended to honor you greatly but look jehovah has deprived you of honor
12  baʹlaam replied to baʹlak did i not say to the messengers you sent
13  if baʹlak were to give me his house full of silver and gold i could not of my own will do anything beyond the order of jehovah whether good or bad
i will only speak what jehovah will tell me
14  and now i am going away to my people
come and let me advise you what this people will do to your people in the future
15  so he spoke this proverbial saying the saying of baʹlaam the son of beʹorand the saying of a man whose eyes have been opened
16  the saying of the one hearing the word of godand the one having the knowledge of the most higha vision of the almighty he sawwhile bowing down with his eyes uncovered
17  i will see him but not nowi will behold him but not soon
a star will come out of jacoband a scepter will rise out of israel
and he will certainly break apart the forehead of moʹaband the skull of all the sons of tumult
18  and eʹdom will become a possessionyes seʹir the possession of his enemieswhile israel is displaying his courage
19  and out of jacob one will be subduingand he will destroy any survivor from the city
20  when he saw amʹalek he continued his proverbial saying amʹalek was the first of the nationsbut in the end he will perish
21  when he saw the kenʹites he continued his proverbial saying secure is your dwelling and set on the crag is your abode
22  but someone will burn kaʹin down
how long before assyrʹia carries you away captive
23  and he continued his proverbial saying woe who will survive when god does this
24  ships will come from the coast of kitʹtimand they will afflict assyrʹiaand they will afflict eʹber
but he too will utterly perish
25  then baʹlaam got up and went and returned to his place
baʹlak also went his own way
5  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
2  command the israelites to send out of the camp every leprous person and everyone having a discharge and everyone unclean by a dead person
3  whether a male or a female you should send them out
you should send them outside the camp so that they may not contaminate the camps of those in whose midst i am dwelling
4  therefore the israelites did so and sent them outside the camp
just as jehovah told moses so the israelites did
5  jehovah continued speaking to moses saying
6  tell the israelites if a man or a woman commits any of the sins of mankind and acts unfaithfully toward jehovah that person has become guilty
7  he must confess the sin that he has committed and return the full amount as compensation for his guilt and also add a fifth of its value he is to give it to the one he wronged
8  but if the victim does not have a close relative to receive the compensation it should be returned to jehovah and will belong to the priest apart from the ram of atonement with which he will make atonement for him
9  every holy contribution from the israelites that is presented to the priest should become his
10  the holy things of each person will remain his own
whatever each one gives to the priest that will belong to the priest
11  jehovah went on to speak to moses saying
12  speak to the israelites and tell them this is what should be done if a mans wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him
13  and another man has sexual relations with her but it was unknown to her husband and remains undiscovered so that she has defiled herself but there is no witness against her and she has not been caught
14  whether the husband becomes jealous and suspicious of his wifes faithfulness when she has defiled herself or whether he is jealous and suspicious of his wifes faithfulness when she has not defiled herself
15  the man must bring his wife to the priest along with an offering for her a tenth of an eʹphah of barley flour
he must not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it because it is a grain offering of jealousy a grain offering bringing guilt to mind
16  the priest will bring her forward and make her stand before jehovah
17  the priest will take holy water in an earthenware vessel and the priest will take some of the dust from the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water
18  and the priest will make the woman stand before jehovah and unbind the womans hair and put in her palms the grain offering for a reminder that is the grain offering of jealousy and the priest will have in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse
19  the priest will then make her swear saying to the woman if no other man had sexual relations with you while you were under your husbands authority and you have not gone astray and become defiled may you be free of the effect of this bitter water that brings a curse
20  but if you have gone astray while under your husbands authority by defiling yourself and you have had sexual relations with another man besides your husband
21  the priest will then make the woman swear an oath that includes a curse and the priest will say to the woman may jehovah make you an object for cursing and for an oath among your people as jehovah makes your thigh fall away and causes your abdomen to swell
22  this water that brings a curse will enter into your intestines to cause your abdomen to swell and make your thigh fall away
to this the woman should say amen amen
23  then the priest should write these curses in the book and wash them off into the bitter water
24  he will then make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse and the water that brings a curse will enter into her and produce bitterness
25  and the priest should take the grain offering of jealousy from the womans hand and wave the grain offering back and forth before jehovah and he will bring it near the altar
26  the priest will take a handful of the grain offering as a token offering and make it smoke on the altar and afterward he will make the woman drink the water
27  when he makes her drink the water if she has defiled herself and committed an act of unfaithfulness toward her husband the water that brings a curse will then enter into her and become something bitter and her abdomen will swell and her thigh will fall away and the woman will become an object of cursing among her people
28  however if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean she will then be free from such punishment and she will be able to conceive and produce offspring
29  this is the law about jealousy when a woman may go astray and defile herself while under her husbands authority
30  or in the case of a man who becomes jealous and suspects his wife of unfaithfulness he should make his wife stand before jehovah and the priest must carry out toward her all this law
31  the man will be free from guilt but his wife will answer for her guilt
36  the family heads of the descendants of gilʹead the son of maʹchir the son of manasʹseh of the families of the sons of joseph approached and spoke before moses and the chieftains the family heads of the israelites
2  they said jehovah commanded my lord to distribute the land by lot as an inheritance to the israelites and my lord was commanded by jehovah to give the inheritance of our brother zeloʹphehad to his daughters
3  if they marry men from another israelite tribe the womens inheritance will also be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers and be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they would then belong so that it would be withdrawn from the lot of our inheritance
4  now when the jubilee takes place for the people of israel the womens inheritance will also be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they then belong so that their inheritance would be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
5  then moses commanded the israelites at the order of jehovah what the tribe of the sons of joseph is saying is correct
6  this is the word that jehovah has commanded for the daughters of zeloʹphehad they may marry whomever they wish
however they should marry someone from a family of the tribe of their father
7  no inheritance of the israelites should circulate from tribe to tribe for the israelites should hold on to the inheritance of the tribe of their forefathers
8  and every daughter who possesses an inheritance among the tribes of israel should become a wife of a descendant of her fathers tribe so that the israelites may keep possession of the inheritance of their forefathers
9  no inheritance should circulate from one tribe to another tribe for the tribes of israel should hold on to their own inheritance
10  the daughters of zeloʹphehad did just as jehovah had commanded moses
11  so mahʹlah tirʹzah hogʹlah milʹcah and noah the daughters of zeloʹphehad married the sons of their fathers brothers
12  they became wives of men from the families of manasʹseh the son of joseph so that their inheritance would remain in the tribe of their fathers family
13  these are the commandments and the judicial decisions that jehovah gave to the israelites through moses on the desert plains of moʹab by the jordan at jerʹicho
15  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
2  speak to the israelites and say to them when you eventually come into the land that i am giving you to dwell in
3  and you make an offering by fire to jehovah from the herd or from the flockwhether a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or a voluntary offering or an offering during your seasonal festivals in order to make a pleasing aroma to jehovah
4  the one presenting his offering must also present to jehovah a grain offering of fine flour a tenth of an eʹphah mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil
5  you should also offer wine as a drink offering a fourth of a hin together with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice of each male lamb
6  or for a ram you should make a grain offering of two tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil
7  and you should present wine as a drink offering a third of a hin as a pleasing aroma to jehovah
8  but if you should offer a male of the herd as a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or communion sacrifices to jehovah
9  you should also present together with the male of the herd a grain offering of three tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil
10  you should also present wine as a drink offering half a hin as an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to jehovah
11  this is what should be done for each bull or for each ram or for each of the male lambs or of the goats
12  whatever may be the number that you offer that is what you should do for each one according to their number
13  this is how every nativeborn israelite should present an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to jehovah
14  if a foreigner who is residing with you or one who has been in your midst for many of your generations should also make an offering by fire as a pleasing aroma to jehovah he should do just as you do
15  you who are of the congregation and the foreigner who is residing with you will have one statute
it will be a lasting statute for all your generations
the foreign resident should be the same as you before jehovah
16  there should be one law and one judicial decision for you and for the foreigner who is residing with you
17  jehovah went on to say to moses
18  speak to the israelites and tell them when you come into the land where i am bringing you
19  and you eat any of the bread of the land you should make a contribution to jehovah
20  you should make a contribution of the firstfruits of your coarse meal as ringshaped loaves
like the contribution of a threshing floor is the way you should contribute it
21  some of the firstfruits of your coarse meal you should give as a contribution to jehovah throughout your generations
22  now if you make a mistake and fail to observe all these commandments that jehovah has spoken to moses
23  all that jehovah has commanded you through moses from the day that jehovah commanded and onward for your generations
24  and if it was done by mistake and without the knowledge of the assembly the whole assembly must offer one young bull as a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to jehovah together with its grain offering and its drink offering according to the regular procedure and one young goat as a sin offering
25  the priest will make atonement for the whole assembly of the israelites and it will be forgiven them because it was a mistake and they brought as their offering an offering made by fire to jehovah and their sin offering before jehovah for their mistake
26  it will be forgiven the whole assembly of the israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst because it was by mistake on the part of all the people
27  if any person should sin by mistake then he must present a female goat in its first year for a sin offering
28  and the priest will make atonement for the person who made a mistake by an unintentional sin before jehovah so as to make atonement for it and it will be forgiven him
29  as for the nativeborn among the israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst there should be one law for you in the matter of doing something unintentionally
30  but the person who does something deliberately whether he is nativeborn or a foreign resident is blaspheming jehovah and must be cut off from among his people
31  because he has despised jehovahs word and broken his commandment that person should be cut off without fail
his own error is upon him
32  while the israelites were in the wilderness they found a man collecting pieces of wood on the sabbath day
33  those who found him collecting wood brought him up to moses and aaron and the whole assembly
34  they committed him into custody because it had not been specified what should be done to him
35  and jehovah said to moses the man should be put to death without fail and the whole assembly should stone him outside the camp
36  so the whole assembly brought him outside the camp and stoned him so that he died just as jehovah had commanded moses
37  jehovah went on to say this to moses
38  speak to the israelites and tell them that they must make for themselves fringed edges on the skirts of their garments throughout their generations and they are to put a blue string above the fringed edge of the skirt
39  you must have this fringed edge so that you will see it and remember all the commandments of jehovah and observe them
you must not follow your own hearts and eyes which are leading you to spiritual prostitution
40  this will help you remember and you will observe all my commandments and be holy to your god
41  i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt in order to prove myself your god
i am jehovah your god
20  in the first month the entire assembly of the israelites came into the wilderness of zin and the people began dwelling in kaʹdesh
it was there that mirʹiam died and was buried
2  now there was no water for the assembly and they gathered together against moses and aaron
3  the people were quarreling with moses saying if only we had died when our brothers died before jehovah
4  why have you brought jehovahs congregation into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here
5  and why have you led us up out of egypt to bring us into this evil place it is no place for seed and figs and vines and pomegranates and there is no water to drink
6  then moses and aaron came from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell with their faces to the ground and jehovahs glory began to appear to them
7  then jehovah said to moses
8  take the rod and call the assembly together you and aaron your brother and speak to the crag before their eyes that it may give its water and you will bring out water for them from the crag and give the assembly and their livestock something to drink
9  so moses took the rod from before jehovah just as he had commanded him
10  then moses and aaron called the congregation together before the crag and he said to them hear now you rebels must we bring out water for you from this crag
11  with that moses lifted his hand up and struck the crag twice with his rod and much water began to pour out and the assembly and their livestock began to drink
12  jehovah later said to moses and aaron because you did not show faith in me and sanctify me before the eyes of the people of israel you will not bring this congregation into the land that i will give them
13  these are the waters of merʹibah where the israelites quarreled with jehovah so that he was sanctified among them
14  then moses sent messengers from kaʹdesh to the king of eʹdom this is what your brother israel says you well know all the hardship that we have experienced
15  our fathers went to egypt and we dwelled in egypt many years and the egyptians mistreated us and our fathers
16  finally we cried out to jehovah and he heard us and sent an angel and brought us out of egypt and here we are in kaʹdesh a city on the border of your territory
17  please let us pass through your land
we will not pass through any field or vineyard and we will not drink the water of any well
we will march on the kings road without turning to the right or the left until we pass through your territory
18  however eʹdom said to him you may not pass through our territory
if you do i will come out with the sword to meet you
19  in turn the israelites said to him by the highway we will go up and if we and our livestock drink your water we will pay for it
we want nothing more than to pass through on foot
20  still he said you may not pass through
with that eʹdom came out to encounter him with many people and a strong army
21  so eʹdom refused to allow israel to pass through his territory therefore israel turned away from him
22  the people of israel the entire assembly departed from kaʹdesh and came to mount hor
23  then jehovah said to moses and aaron in mount hor by the border of the land of eʹdom
24  aaron will be gathered to his people
he will not enter the land that i will give to the israelites because you both rebelled against my order regarding the waters of merʹibah
25  take aaron and his son eleaʹzar and bring them up into mount hor
26  remove aarons garments and clothe eleaʹzar his son with them and aaron will die there
27  so moses did just as jehovah had commanded and they climbed mount hor before the eyes of all the assembly
28  then moses removed aarons garments and clothed eleaʹzar his son with them
after that aaron died there on the top of the mountain
and moses and eleaʹzar came down from the mountain
29  when all the assembly saw that aaron had died the entire house of israel wept for aaron for 30 days
1  and jehovah spoke to moses in the wilderness of siʹnai in the tent of meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year of their coming out of the land of egypt
he said
2  take a census of the whole assembly of the israelites individually according to their families according to their paternal houses according to the count of the names of all the males
3  you and aaron are to register by their companies all those from 20 years old and up who can serve in the army in israel
4  take with you one man from each tribe each one is to be a head of his paternal house
5  these are the names of the men who will stand with you of reuʹben eliʹzur the son of shedʹeur
6  of simʹeon sheluʹmiel the son of zurishadʹdai
7  of judah nahʹshon the son of amminʹadab
8  of isʹsachar nethanʹel the son of zuʹar
9  of zebʹulun eliʹab the son of heʹlon
10  of the sons of joseph from eʹphraim elishʹama the son of ammiʹhud from manasʹseh gamaʹliel the son of pedahʹzur
11  of benjamin abʹidan the son of gideoʹni
12  of dan ahieʹzer the son of ammishadʹdai
13  of ashʹer paʹgiel the son of ochʹran
14  of gad eliʹasaph the son of deuʹel
15  of naphʹtali ahiʹra the son of eʹnan
16  these are the ones summoned from the assembly
they are the chieftains of the tribes of their fathers the heads of the thousands of israel
17  so moses and aaron took these men who had been designated by name
18  they gathered all the assembly on the first day of the second month so that they might be registered individually by name by family and by their paternal houses from 20 years old and up
19  just as jehovah had commanded moses
so he registered them in the wilderness of siʹnai
20  the sons of reuʹben the descendants of israels firstborn were listed by name by family and by their paternal houses
all the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted individually
21  and the number registered of the tribe of reuʹben was 46500

42  the descendants of naphʹtali were listed by name by family and by their paternal houses
all the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted
43  and the number registered of the tribe of naphʹtali was 53400
44  these were registered by moses together with aaron and the 12 chieftains of israel each representing his paternal house
45  all the israelites from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army in israel were registered by their paternal house
46  and the total number registered was 603550
47  but the levites were not registered in among them by the tribe of their fathers
48  so jehovah told moses
49  only the tribe of leʹvi you are not to register and you should not include the number of them along with the other israelites
50  you should appoint the levites over the tabernacle of the testimony and over all its utensils and over everything that belongs to it
they will carry the tabernacle and all its utensils and they will minister at it and they are to camp around the tabernacle
51  whenever the tabernacle is to be moved the levites should take it down and when the tabernacle is to be reassembled the levites should set it up and any unauthorized person who comes near should be put to death
52  each israelite should set up his tent in his assigned camp each man according to his threetribe division by their companies
53  and the levites should encamp around the tabernacle of the testimony so that no indignation may arise against the assembly of the israelites and the levites must be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the testimony
54  the people of israel did all that jehovah had commanded moses
they did just so
2  jehovah now spoke to moses and aaron saying
2  the israelites should encamp where their threetribe division is assigned each man near the banner of his paternal house
they should camp facing the tent of meeting all around it
3  those camping on the east side toward the sunrise will be the threetribe division of the encampment of judah by their companies the chieftain for the sons of judah is nahʹshon the son of amminʹadab
4  those registered in his army are 74600
5  camping alongside him will be the tribe of isʹsachar the chieftain for the sons of isʹsachar is nethanʹel the son of zuʹar
6  those registered in his army are 54400
7  next is the tribe of zebʹulun the chieftain for the sons of zebʹulun is eliʹab the son of heʹlon
8  those registered in his army are 57400
9  all those registered in the armies of the camp of judah are 186400
they should break camp first
10  the threetribe division of the encampment of reuʹben by their companies will be toward the south the chieftain for the sons of reuʹben is eliʹzur the son of shedʹeur
11  those registered in his army are 46500
12  camping alongside him will be the tribe of simʹeon the chieftain for the sons of simʹeon is sheluʹmiel the son of zurishadʹdai
13  those registered in his army are 59300
14  next is the tribe of gad the chieftain for the sons of gad is eliʹasaph the son of reuʹel
15  those registered in his army are 45650
16  all those registered in the armies of the camp of reuʹben are 151450 and they should break camp second
17  when the tent of meeting is moved the camp of the levites should be in the middle of the other camps
they should travel in the same order as they encamp with each in his place according to their threetribe divisions
18  the threetribe division of the encampment of eʹphraim by their companies will be toward the west the chieftain for the sons of eʹphraim is elishʹama the son of ammiʹhud
19  those registered in his army are 40500
20  next to him will be the tribe of manasʹseh the chieftain for the sons of manasʹseh is gamaʹliel the son of pedahʹzur
21  those registered in his army are 32200
22  next is the tribe of benjamin the chieftain for the sons of benjamin is abʹidan the son of gideoʹni
23  those registered in his army are 35400
24  all those registered in the armies of the camp of eʹphraim are 108100 and they should break camp third
25  the threetribe division of the encampment of dan by their companies will be toward the north the chieftain for the sons of dan is ahieʹzer the son of ammishadʹdai

30  those registered in his army are 53400
31  all those registered in the camp of dan are 157600
they should break camp last according to their threetribe divisions
32  these were the israelites who were registered according to their paternal houses the total of those in the camps registered for the army was 603550
33  but the levites did not get registered along with the other israelites just as jehovah had commanded moses
34  the israelites did everything that jehovah had commanded moses
this is how they encamped by their threetribe divisions and how they broke camp each by family and according to their paternal houses
3  now these were the family lines of aaron and moses in the day that jehovah spoke with moses on mount siʹnai
2  these were the names of aarons sons the firstborn naʹdab and abiʹhu eleaʹzar and ithʹamar
3  these were the names of aarons sons the anointed priests who had been installed to serve as priests
4  however naʹdab and abiʹhu died before jehovah when they offered unauthorized fire before jehovah in the wilderness of siʹnai and they did not have any sons
but eleaʹzar and ithʹamar continued to serve as priests along with aaron their father
5  jehovah then said to moses

39  all the levite males from a month old and up whom moses and aaron registered by their families at the order of jehovah were 22000

on the very day after the passover the israelites went out with confidence before the eyes of all the egyptians

38  and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the order of jehovah and died there in the 40th year after the israelites left the land of egypt in the fifth month on the first of the month
39  aaron was 123 years old at his death on mount hor
40  now the king of aʹrad the caʹnaanite who was dwelling in the negʹeb in the land of caʹnaan heard about the coming of the israelites
41  in time they departed from mount hor and camped at zalmoʹnah
42  after that they departed from zalmoʹnah and camped at puʹnon

49  they continued camping along the jordan from bethjeshʹimoth as far as aʹbelshitʹtim on the desert plains of moʹab
50  jehovah spoke to moses on the desert plains of moʹab by the jordan at jerʹicho saying
51  speak to the israelites and tell them you are crossing the jordan into the land of caʹnaan
52  you must drive away all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their carvings of stone and all their metal statues and you should demolish all their sacred high places
53  and you will take possession of the land and dwell in it because i will certainly give you the land as a possession
54  you must apportion the land by lot as a possession among your families
to the larger group you should increase his inheritance and to the smaller group you should reduce his inheritance
everyones inheritance will be where his lot falls
you will receive your property as an inheritance by the tribes of your fathers
55  if though you do not drive the inhabitants of the land away from before you those whom you allow to remain will be as irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides and they will harass you in the land where you will dwell
56  and i will do to you what i intended to do to them
12  now mirʹiam and aaron began to speak against moses because of the cushʹite wife he had married for he had taken a cushʹite wife
2  they were saying is it only by moses that jehovah has spoken has he not also spoken through us and jehovah was listening
3  now the man moses was by far the meekest of all the men on the face of the earth
4  jehovah suddenly said to moses and aaron and mirʹiam go out the three of you to the tent of meeting
so the three of them went out
5  and jehovah came down in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called aaron and mirʹiam
both of them went forward
6  he then said hear my words please
if there was a prophet of jehovah among you i would make myself known to him in a vision and i would speak to him in a dream
7  but it is not that way with my servant moses he is being entrusted with all my house
8  facetoface i speak to him openly not by riddles and the appearance of jehovah is what he sees
why then did you not fear to speak against my servant against moses
9  so jehovahs anger burned against them and he departed from them
10  the cloud moved away from over the tent and look mirʹiam was struck with leprosy as white as snow
then aaron turned toward mirʹiam and he saw that she was struck with leprosy
11  immediately aaron said to moses i beg you my lord please do not hold this sin against us we have acted foolishly in what we have done
12  please do not let her continue like someone dead whose flesh is half eaten away at birth
13  and moses began to cry out to jehovah saying o god please heal her please
14  jehovah replied to moses if her father would spit directly in her face would she not be humiliated for seven days let her be quarantined for seven days outside the camp and afterward she may be brought back in
15  so mirʹiam was quarantined outside the camp for seven days and the people did not break camp until mirʹiam was brought back in
16  then the people departed from hazeʹroth and began camping in the wilderness of paʹran
