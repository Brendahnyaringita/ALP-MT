10  while ezʹra was praying and making confession weeping and lying prostrate before the house of the true god a large crowd of men women and children of israel gathered around him for the people were weeping profusely
2  then shecaniʹah the son of jehiʹel of the sons of eʹlam said to ezʹra we have acted unfaithfully against our god by marrying foreign women from the peoples of the land
despite this there is still hope for israel
3  now let us make a covenant with our god to send away all the wives and those born from them in harmony with the direction of jehovah and of those who have reverence for the commandment of our god
let us act according to the law
4  get up for this matter is your responsibility and we are with you
be strong and take action
5  at that ezʹra rose and had the chiefs of the priests the levites and all israel take an oath to do what had been said
so they took an oath
6  ezʹra now got up from before the house of the true god and went to the chamber of jehohaʹnan the son of eliʹashib
although he went there he ate no food and drank no water for he was in mourning because of the unfaithfulness of the exiled people
7  then they made a proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem that all the former exiles gather together at jerusalem
8  and according to the decision of the princes and the elders anyone who did not come within three days time would have all his goods confiscated and he would be banished from the congregation of the exiled people
9  so all the men of judah and benjamin gathered together at jerusalem within three days that is in the ninth month on the 20th day of the month
all the people were sitting in a courtyard of the house of the true god shivering because of the matter at hand and because of the heavy rain
10  then ezʹra the priest rose and said to them you have acted unfaithfully by marrying foreign women and so you have added to the guilt of israel
11  now make confession to jehovah the god of your forefathers and do his will
separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from these foreign wives
12  to this the whole congregation answered with a loud voice it is our duty to do exactly as you say
13  however there are many people and it is the rainy season
it is not possible to stand outside and the matter will not take just one or two days for we have rebelled extensively in this matter
14  so please let our princes represent the entire congregation and let all those in our cities who have married foreign women come at an appointed time along with the elders and judges of each city until we turn back the burning anger of our god from us concerning this matter
15  however jonʹathan the son of asʹahel and jahzeiʹah the son of tikʹvah objected to this and the levites meshulʹlam and shabʹbethai supported them
16  but the former exiles did what was agreed on and ezʹra the priest and the family heads of their paternal houses all designated by name convened separately on the first day of the tenth month to look into the matter
17  and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women
18  and it was discovered that some of the sons of the priests had married foreign women of the sons of jeshʹua the son of jehozʹadak and his brothers maaseiʹah elieʹzer jaʹrib and gedaliʹah
19  but they promised to send their wives away and since they were guilty they would offer a ram of the flock for their guilt
20  of the sons of imʹmer there were hanaʹni and zebadiʹah
21  and of the sons of haʹrim maaseiʹah eliʹjah shemaiʹah jehiʹel and uzziʹah
22  and of the sons of pashʹhur elioeʹnai maaseiʹah ishʹmael nethanʹel joʹzabad and eleaʹsah
23  and of the levites there were joʹzabad shimʹei kelaiʹah that is keliʹta pethahiʹah judah and elieʹzer
24  and of the singers eliʹashib and of the gatekeepers shalʹlum teʹlem and uʹri
25  and of israel of the sons of paʹrosh there were ramiʹah izziʹah malchiʹjah mijʹamin eleaʹzar malchiʹjah and benaiʹah
26  and of the sons of eʹlam mattaniʹah zechariʹah jehiʹel abʹdi jerʹemoth and eliʹjah
27  and of the sons of zatʹtu elioeʹnai eliʹashib mattaniʹah jerʹemoth zaʹbad and aziʹza
28  and of the sons of beʹbai jehohaʹnan hananiʹah zabʹbai and athʹlai
29  and of the sons of baʹni meshulʹlam malʹluch adaiʹah jaʹshub sheʹal and jerʹemoth
30  and of the sons of paʹhathmoʹab adʹna cheʹlal benaiʹah maaseiʹah mattaniʹah bezʹalel binʹnui and manasʹseh
31  and of the sons of haʹrim elieʹzer isshiʹjah malchiʹjah shemaiʹah shimʹeon
32  benjamin malʹluch and shemariʹah
33  of the sons of haʹshum matteʹnai matʹtattah zaʹbad eliphʹelet jerʹemai manasʹseh and shimʹei
34  of the sons of baʹni maadaʹi amʹram uʹel
35  benaiʹah bedeiʹah chelʹuhi
36  vaniʹah merʹemoth eliʹashib
37  mattaniʹah matteʹnai and jaʹasu
38  and of the sons of binʹnui shimʹei
39  shelemiʹah nathan adaiʹah
40  machnadʹebai shaʹshai shaʹrai
41  azʹarel shelemiʹah shemariʹah
42  shalʹlum amariʹah and joseph
43  and of the sons of neʹbo jeiʹel mattithiʹah zaʹbad zebiʹna jadʹdai joel and benaiʹah
44  all of these had taken foreign wives and they sent their wives away along with their sons
4  when the enemies of judah and benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to jehovah the god of israel
2  they immediately approached zerubʹbabel and the heads of the paternal houses and said to them let us build along with you for like you we worship your god and we have been sacrificing to him since the days of king eʹsarhadʹdon of assyrʹia who brought us here
3  however zerubʹbabel and jeshʹua and the rest of the heads of the paternal houses of israel said to them you have no share with us in building a house to our god for we alone will build it to jehovah the god of israel just as king cyrus the king of persia has commanded us
4  then the people of the land were continually discouraging the people of judah and disheartening them from building
5  they hired advisers against them to frustrate their plans all the days of king cyrus of persia until the reign of king dariʹus of persia
6  at the beginning of the reign of ahasueʹrus they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem
7  and in the days of king artaxerxʹes of persia bishʹlam mithʹredath tabʹeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote to artaxerxʹes the king they translated the letter into aramaʹic writing it with aramaʹic characters
8   reʹhum the chief government official and shimʹshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to king artaxerxʹes as follows
9  it was from reʹhum the chief government official and shimʹshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues the judges and the lesser governors the secretaries the people of eʹrech the babylonians the inhabitants of suʹsa that is the eʹlamites
10  and the rest of the nations that the great and honorable asʹenappar took into exile and settled in the cities of samarʹia and the rest in the region beyond the river and now
11  this is a copy of the letter that they sent him
to king artaxerxʹes from your servants the men of the region beyond the river and now
12  let it be known to the king that the jews who came up here from you to us have arrived at jerusalem
they are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city and they are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations
13  now let it be known to the king that if this city should be rebuilt and its walls finished they will not give tax tribute or toll and it will result in a loss to the treasuries of the kings
14  since we eat the salt of the palace and it is not proper for us to see the kings interests harmed we have therefore sent to make this known to the king
15  so that there may be an investigation of the book of records of your ancestors
you will find in the book of records and learn that this city is a rebellious city injurious to kings and provinces and within it have been those stirring up sedition from ancient times
that is why this city was destroyed
16  we are making known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished you will have no control of the region beyond the river
17  the king sent word to reʹhum the chief government official and shimʹshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues who were dwelling in samarʹia and the rest of the region beyond the river greetings and now
18  the official document that you sent us has been clearly read before me
19  by my order an investigation was made and it was found that from long ago the city has had uprisings against kings and rebellions and revolts have taken place there
20  there were powerful kings over jerusalem who ruled the whole region beyond the river and tax tribute and toll were paid to them
21  now issue an order for these men to stop work so that the city may not be rebuilt until i issue an order
22  be careful not to neglect acting in this regard so that the kings interests are not harmed any further
23  now after the copy of the official document of king artaxerxʹes had been read before reʹhum and shimʹshai the scribe and their colleagues they quickly went to jerusalem to the jews and used force to stop them
24  it was then that the work on the house of god which was in jerusalem came to a halt and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of king dariʹus of persia
8  now these were the heads of their paternal houses and the genealogical enrollment of those who went up with me out of babylon during the reign of king artaxerxʹes
2  of the sons of phinʹehas gerʹshom of the sons of ithʹamar daniel of the sons of david hatʹtush
3  of the sons of shecaniʹah of the sons of paʹrosh zechariʹah and with him there was an enrollment of 150 males
4  of the sons of paʹhathmoʹab elʹiehoeʹnai the son of zerahiʹah and with him 200 males
5  of the sons of zatʹtu shecaniʹah the son of jahaziʹel and with him 300 males
6  of the sons of aʹdin eʹbed the son of jonʹathan and with him 50 males
7  of the sons of eʹlam jeshaʹiah the son of athaliʹah and with him 70 males
8  of the sons of shephatiʹah zebadiʹah the son of miʹchael and with him 80 males
9  of the sons of joʹab obadiʹah the son of jehiʹel and with him 218 males
10  of the sons of baʹni sheloʹmith the son of josiphiʹah and with him 160 males
11  of the sons of beʹbai zechariʹah the son of beʹbai and with him 28 males
12  of the sons of azʹgad johaʹnan the son of hakʹkatan and with him 110 males
13  of the sons of adoniʹkam those who were the last and these were their names eliphʹelet jeiʹel and shemaiʹah and with them 60 males
14  and of the sons of bigʹvai uʹthai and zabʹbud and with them 70 males
15  i assembled them at the river that comes to ahaʹva and we camped there for three days
but when i examined the people and the priests i did not find any of the levites there
16  so i sent for elieʹzer arʹiel shemaiʹah elnaʹthan jaʹrib elnaʹthan nathan zechariʹah and meshulʹlam who were leading men and for joiʹarib and elnaʹthan who were instructors
17  then i gave them a command concerning idʹdo the leader in the place called casiphiʹa
i told them to tell idʹdo and his brothers the temple servants who were in casiphiʹa to bring to us ministers for the house of our god
18  since the good hand of our god was upon us they brought a discreet man from the sons of mahʹli the grandson of leʹvi the son of israel namely sherebiʹah and his sons and his brothers 18 men
19  and hashabiʹah and with him jeshaʹiah from the merarʹites his brothers and their sons 20 men
20  and there were 220 of the temple servants whom david and the princes gave to the service of the levites all of whom had been designated by name
21  then i proclaimed a fast there at the river ahaʹva to humble ourselves before our god to seek guidance from him for our journey for us and for our children and for all our goods
22  i was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemies along the way because we had said to the king the good hand of our god is over all those seeking him but his strength and his anger are against all those abandoning him
23  so we fasted and made request of our god concerning this and he listened to our entreaty
24  i now set apart 12 of the chiefs of the priests namely sherebiʹah and hashabiʹah along with ten of their brothers
25  then i weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the utensils the contribution that the king and his advisers and his princes and all the israelites who were present there had made to the house of our god
26  thus i weighed out into their hand 650 talents of silver 100 silver utensils worth 2 talents 100 talents of gold
27  20 small gold bowls worth 1000 darics and 2 utensils of fine copper gleaming red as desirable as gold
28  then i said to them you are holy to jehovah and the utensils are holy and the silver and the gold are a voluntary offering to jehovah the god of your forefathers
29  guard them carefully until you weigh them out before the chiefs of the priests and the levites and the princes of the paternal houses of israel in jerusalem in the chambers of the house of jehovah
30  and the priests and the levites took the silver and the gold and the utensils that had been weighed out to them in order to bring them to jerusalem to the house of our god
31  finally we pulled away from the river ahaʹva on the 12th day of the first month to go to jerusalem and the hand of our god was over us and he rescued us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the way
32  so we came to jerusalem and stayed there for three days
33  and on the fourth day we weighed out the silver and the gold and the utensils in the house of our god and handed them over to merʹemoth son of uriʹjah the priest and with him was eleaʹzar son of phinʹehas and with them were the levites joʹzabad son of jeshʹua and noadiʹah son of binʹnui
34  everything was numbered and weighed and all the weight was recorded
35  those coming out of the captivity the former exiles presented burnt sacrifices to the god of israel 12 bulls for all israel 96 rams 77 male lambs and 12 male goats as a sin offering all of this was a burnt offering to jehovah
36  then we gave the decrees of the king to the satraps of the king and the governors of the region beyond the river and they supported the people and the house of the true god
9  and as soon as these things had been done the princes approached me and said the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands and their detestable practices those of the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the perʹizzites the jebʹusites the amʹmonites the moʹabites the egyptians and the amʹorites
2  they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons
now they the holy offspring have become mingled with the peoples of the lands
the princes and the deputy rulers have been the foremost offenders in this unfaithfulness
3  now as soon as i heard of this i ripped apart my garment and my sleeveless coat and pulled out some of the hair of my head and my beard and i sat down in shock
4  then everyone who had reverence for the words of the god of israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiled people while i was sitting in shock until the evening grain offering
5  and at the time of the evening grain offering i stood up from my humiliation with my garment and my sleeveless coat torn apart and i got down on my knees and spread out my hands to jehovah my god
6  and i said o my god i feel ashamed and embarrassed to raise my face to you o my god for our errors have multiplied over our heads and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens
7  from the days of our forefathers until this day our guilt has been great and because of our errors we our kings and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity to plunder and to disgrace as is the case today
8  but now for a brief moment favor has come from jehovah our god by letting a remnant escape and by giving us a secure position in his holy place to make our eyes shine o our god and to revive us a little in our slavery
9  for although we are slaves our god has not abandoned us in our slavery but he has extended his loyal love toward us before the kings of persia to revive us so as to raise up the house of our god and to restore its ruins and to give us a stone wall in judah and in jerusalem
10  but now what can we say o our god after this for we have left your commandments
11  which you gave us through your servants the prophets saying the land that you are going in to take possession of is an impure land because of the impurity of the peoples of the lands because of their detestable practices with which they have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness
12  therefore do not give your daughters to their sons neither accept their daughters for your sons and you must never seek their peace and their prosperity so that you may grow strong and eat the good of the land and take possession of it for your sons forever
13  and after all that has come upon us for our bad deeds and our great guiltfor you o our god have not dealt with us according to our error and you have allowed those of us here to escape
14  are we to break your commandments again and form marriage alliances with the peoples who practice these detestable things would you not become so angry with us that you would completely destroy us leaving no remnant or survivor
15  o jehovah the god of israel you are righteous for we have survived as a remnant to this day
here we are before you in our guilt for it is impossible to stand before you because of this
7  after these things during the reign of king artaxerxʹes of persia ezʹra returned
he was the son of seraiʹah son of azariʹah son of hilkiʹah
2  son of shalʹlum son of zaʹdok son of ahiʹtub
3  son of amariʹah son of azariʹah son of meraʹioth
4  son of zerahiʹah son of uzʹzi son of bukʹki
5  son of abishuʹa son of phinʹehas son of eleaʹzar son of aaron the chief priest
6  this ezʹra came up from babylon
he was a copyist who was wellversed in the law of moses which jehovah the god of israel had given
the king granted everything he requested for the hand of jehovah his god was upon him
7  some of the israelites the priests the levites the singers the gatekeepers and the temple servants went up to jerusalem in the seventh year of king artaxerxʹes
8  and ezʹra came to jerusalem in the fifth month in the seventh year of the king
9  on the first day of the first month he began the journey from babylon and he arrived in jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month for the good hand of his god was upon him
10  ezʹra had prepared his heart to consult the law of jehovah and to practice it and to teach its regulations and judgments in israel
11  this is a copy of the letter that king artaxerxʹes gave to ezʹra the priest and copyist an expert in the study of the commandments of jehovah and of his regulations to israel
12   artaxerxʹes the king of kings to ezʹra the priest the copyist of the law of the god of the heavens may you have perfect peace
and now
13  i have issued an order that everyone in my realm of the people of israel and their priests and levites who is willing to go with you to jerusalem should go
14  for you are sent by the king and his seven advisers to investigate whether the law of your god which is with you is being applied in judah and jerusalem
15  and to take the silver and the gold that the king and his advisers have voluntarily given to the god of israel whose residence is in jerusalem
16  with all the silver and the gold that you receive in all the province of babylon along with the gift that the people and the priests voluntarily give to the house of their god which is in jerusalem
17  and you are to buy promptly with this money bulls rams lambs along with their grain offerings and their drink offerings and you are to present them on the altar of the house of your god in jerusalem
18  and whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do you may do with the rest of the silver and the gold according to the will of your god
19  and all the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your god you are to deliver before god at jerusalem
20  and the rest of the necessities of the house of your god that you are required to give you will give out of the royal treasury
21  i king artaxerxʹes have issued an order to all the treasurers in the region beyond the river that everything that ezʹra the priest the copyist of the law of the god of the heavens requests of you is to be done promptly
22  up to 100 talents of silver 100 cor measures of wheat 100 bath measures of wine 100 bath measures of oil and salt without limit
23  let everything that is ordered by the god of the heavens be done with zeal for the house of the god of the heavens so that there may be no wrath against the kings realm and his sons
24  and you are further advised that it is not permitted to impose any tax tribute or toll on any of the priests and levites musicians doorkeepers temple servants and workers of this house of god
25  and you ezʹra according to the wisdom that you possess from your god appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people in the region beyond the river all those who know the laws of your god and you should instruct anyone who does not know them
26  and everyone who does not observe the law of your god and the law of the king should have judgment executed on him promptly whether it is death banishment a fine or imprisonment
27  may jehovah the god of our forefathers be praised who put it into the heart of the king to beautify the house of jehovah in jerusalem
28  and he has shown me loyal love before the king and his advisers and all the mighty princes of the king
so i took courage because the hand of jehovah my god was upon me and i gathered out of israel leading men to go up with me
6  it was then that king dariʹus issued an order and they made an investigation in the archives where the treasures were deposited in babylon
2  and a scroll was found in the citadel at ecbatʹana in the province of meʹdia and the following memorandum was written on it
3  in the first year of king cyrus king cyrus issued an order concerning the house of god in jerusalem let the house be rebuilt as the place where they are to offer sacrifices and its foundations are to be set in place its height is to be 60 cubits its width 60 cubits
4  with three layers of large stones rolled into place and one layer of timbers and let the expense be paid from the kings house
5  also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of god that nebuchadnezʹzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and brought to babylon be returned so that they may be put in their place in the temple in jerusalem and be deposited in the house of god
6  so now tatʹtenai the governor of the region beyond the river sheʹtharbozʹenai and your colleagues the lesser governors of the region beyond the riverstay away from there
7  do not interfere with the work on that house of god
the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews will rebuild that house of god in its former place
8  furthermore i am issuing an order as to what you are to do for these elders of the jews for rebuilding that house of god from the royal treasury from the tax collected in the region beyond the river the expenses are to be promptly given to these men to continue without interruption
9  and whatever is neededyoung bulls as well as rams and lambs for the burnt offerings to the god of heaven wheat salt wine and oil just as the priests who are in jerusalem sayis to be given them continually day by day without fail
10  so that they may continually present offerings that please the god of the heavens and pray for the life of the king and his sons
11  i have also issued an order that if anyone violates this decree a timber will be pulled out of his house and he will be lifted up and fastened to it and his house will be turned into a public latrine for this offense
12  and may the god who has caused his name to reside there overthrow any king and people who lift a hand to violate this order and destroy that house of god which is in jerusalem
i dariʹus issue this order
let it be done promptly
13  then tatʹtenai the governor of the region beyond the river sheʹtharbozʹenai and their colleagues promptly carried out everything that king dariʹus had ordered
14  and the elders of the jews continued building and making progress urged on by the prophesying of hagʹgai the prophet and zechariʹah the grandson of idʹdo they finished building it by the order of the god of israel and by the order of cyrus and dariʹus and king artaxerxʹes of persia
15  they completed the house by the third day of the month of aʹdar in the sixth year of the reign of king dariʹus
16  then the israelites the priests the levites and the rest of the former exiles held the inauguration of this house of god with joy
17  and they presented for the inauguration of this house of god 100 bulls 200 rams 400 lambs and as a sin offering for all israel 12 male goats corresponding to the number of the tribes of israel
18  and they appointed the priests in their groups and the levites in their divisions for the service of god in jerusalem according to what is written in the book of moses
19  and the former exiles held the passover on the 14th day of the first month
20  the priests and the levites without exception had cleansed themselves so they were all clean they slaughtered the passover sacrifice for all the former exiles for their fellow priests and for themselves
21  then the israelites who had returned from the exile ate of it along with everyone who had joined them and had separated himself from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to worship jehovah the god of israel
22  they also joyfully held the festival of unleavened bread for seven days for jehovah caused them to rejoice and he had made the heart of the king of assyrʹia favorable toward them so that he supported them in the work of the house of the true god the god of israel
5  then the prophets hagʹgai and zechariʹah the grandson of idʹdo prophesied to the jews who were in judah and in jerusalem in the name of the god of israel who was over them
2  it was then that zerubʹbabel the son of shealʹtiel and jeshʹua the son of jehozʹadak started to rebuild the house of god which was in jerusalem and the prophets of god were with them and supported them
3  at that time tatʹtenai the governor of the region beyond the river and sheʹtharbozʹenai and their colleagues came to them and asked them who issued an order to you to build this house and to finish this structure
4  then they asked them what are the names of the men who are working on this building
5  but god was watching over the elders of the jews and they did not stop them until the report could be sent to dariʹus and an official document could be sent back concerning this
6  here is a copy of the letter that tatʹtenai the governor of the region beyond the river and sheʹtharbozʹenai and his colleagues the lesser governors of the region beyond the river sent to king dariʹus
7  they sent the report to him and this is what they wrote to king dariʹus all peace
8  let it be known to the king that we went to the province of judah to the house of the great god and it is being built with large stones rolled into place and timbers are being laid in the walls
the work is being eagerly done by the people and is making progress through their efforts
9  then we questioned their elders asking them who issued an order to you to build this house and to finish this structure
10  we also asked them their names to inform you so that we could write the names of the men who are taking the lead
11  this is the response they gave us we are the servants of the god of the heavens and the earth and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago which a great king of israel built and finished
12  however because our fathers angered the god of the heavens he gave them into the hand of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon the chaldeʹan who demolished this house and took the people into exile to babylon
13  nevertheless in the first year of king cyrus of babylon king cyrus issued an order to rebuild this house of god
14  moreover king cyrus took out of the temple of babylon the gold and silver vessels of the house of god that nebuchadnezʹzar had taken from the temple in jerusalem and had brought to the temple of babylon
they were given to a man named sheshbazʹzar whom cyrus made governor
15  cyrus said to him take these vessels
go deposit them in the temple that is in jerusalem and let the house of god be rebuilt in its former place
16  then this sheshbazʹzar came and he laid the foundations of the house of god which is in jerusalem and it has been under construction from then until now but it has not been completed
17  now if it seems good to the king let an investigation be made in the royal treasury there in babylon to determine whether king cyrus issued an order to rebuild that house of god in jerusalem and let the decision of the king concerning this be sent to us
1  in the first year of king cyrus of persia in order that jehovahs word spoken by jeremiah would be fulfilled jehovah stirred the spirit of king cyrus of persia to make a proclamation throughout his kingdom which he also put in writing saying
2  this is what king cyrus of persia says jehovah the god of the heavens has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has commissioned me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judah
3  whoever there is among you of all his people may his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and rebuild the house of jehovah the god of israelhe is the true godwhose house was in jerusalem
4  anyone who is residing as a foreigner wherever he may be let him be helped by his neighbors by their giving him silver and gold goods and livestock along with the voluntary offering for the house of the true god which was in jerusalem
5  then the heads of the paternal houses of judah and of benjamin and the priests and the leviteseveryone whose spirit the true god had stirredprepared to go up and rebuild the house of jehovah which was in jerusalem
6  all those around them supported them by giving them utensils of silver and of gold goods livestock and valuable things besides all the voluntary offerings
7  king cyrus also brought out the utensils of the house of jehovah that nebuchadnezʹzar had taken from jerusalem and had put in the house of his god
8  king cyrus of persia brought them out under the supervision of mithʹredath the treasurer who made an inventory of them for sheshbazʹzar the chieftain of judah
9  now this was the inventory 30 basketshaped vessels of gold 1000 basketshaped vessels of silver 29 replacement vessels
10  30 small gold bowls 410 small silver bowls 1000 other utensils

3  when the seventh month arrived and the israelites were in their cities they gathered together with one accord in jerusalem
2  jeshʹua the son of jehozʹadak and his fellow priests and zerubʹbabel the son of shealʹtiel and his brothers rose up and built the altar of the god of israel so that they could offer up burnt sacrifices on it as it is written in the law of moses the man of the true god
3  so they set the altar up on its former site despite their fear of the peoples of the surrounding lands and they began offering up burnt sacrifices to jehovah on it the morning and the evening burnt sacrifices
4  then they held the festival of booths according to what is written and day by day they offered up the specified number of burnt sacrifices that were required each day
5  afterward they offered up the regular burnt offering and the offerings for the new moons and those for all the sanctified festival seasons of jehovah as well as those from everyone who willingly offered a voluntary offering to jehovah
6  from the first day of the seventh month they started to offer up burnt sacrifices to jehovah though the foundation of jehovahs temple had not yet been laid
7  they gave money to the stonecutters and the craftsmen and food and drink and oil to the sidoʹnians and the tyrʹians for bringing cedar timbers by sea from lebʹanon to jopʹpa according to the authorization granted them by king cyrus of persia

9  so jeshʹua his sons and his brothers and kadʹmiel and his sons the sons of judah joined together to supervise those doing the work in the house of the true god along with the sons of henʹadad their sons and their brothers the levites
10  when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of jehovah then the priests in official clothing with the trumpets and the levites the sons of aʹsaph with the cymbals stood up to praise jehovah according to the direction of king david of israel
11  and they began to sing in response by praising and giving thanks to jehovah for he is good his loyal love toward israel endures forever
then all the people shouted with a loud shout of praise to jehovah because the foundation of the house of jehovah had been laid
12  many of the priests the levites and the heads of the paternal housesthe old men who had seen the former housewept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid while many others shouted joyfully at the top of their voice
13  so the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shouts from the sound of the weeping for the people were shouting so loudly that the sound was heard from a great distance
