10  later the king of the amʹmonites died and his son haʹnun became king in his place
2  at that david said i will show loyal love toward haʹnun the son of naʹhash as his father showed loyal love toward me
so david sent his servants to offer him comfort over the loss of his father
but when davids servants came into the land of the amʹmonites
3  the princes of the amʹmonites said to haʹnun their lord do you think that david is honoring your father by sending comforters to you is it not to search through the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it that david has sent his servants to you
4  so haʹnun took the servants of david and shaved off half their beards and cut their garments in half at their buttocks and sent them away
5  when david was told he at once sent men to meet them because the men had been deeply humiliated and the king told them stay in jerʹicho until your beards grow back and then return
6  in time the amʹmonites saw that they had become a stench to david so the amʹmonites sent and hired syrians of bethreʹhob and syrians of zoʹbah 20000 foot soldiers and the king of maʹacah with 1000 men and from ishʹtob 12000 men
7  when david heard about it he sent joʹab and the entire army including his mightiest warriors
8  and the amʹmonites went out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the city gate while the syrians of zoʹbah and of reʹhob along with ishʹtob and maʹacah were by themselves in the open field
9  when joʹab saw that the battle charges were coming against him from the front and the rear he chose some of the best troops in israel and drew them up in battle formation to meet the syrians
10  he put the rest of the men under the command of his brother abishʹai in order to draw them up in battle formation to meet the amʹmonites
11  then he said if the syrians become too strong for me then you must come to my rescue but if the amʹmonites become too strong for you i will come to your rescue
12  we must be strong and courageous for our people and for the cities of our god and jehovah will do what is good in his eyes
13  then joʹab and his men advanced to meet the syrians in battle and they fled from before him
14  when the amʹmonites saw that the syrians had fled they fled from abishʹai and went into the city
after that joʹab returned from the amʹmonites and came to jerusalem
15  when the syrians saw that they had been defeated by israel they regrouped
16  so hadadeʹzer sent for the syrians in the region of the river and then they came to heʹlam with shoʹbach the chief of the army of hadadeʹzer leading them
17  when the report was made to david he immediately gathered all israel and crossed the jordan and came to heʹlam
the syrians then drew up in battle formation to meet david and fought against him
18  but the syrians fled from israel and david killed 700 charioteers and 40000 horsemen of the syrians and he struck down shoʹbach the chief of their army who died there
19  when all the kings the servants of hadadeʹzer saw that they had been defeated by israel they promptly made peace with israel and became their subjects and the syrians were afraid to help the amʹmonites anymore
4  when sauls son ishboʹsheth heard that abʹner had died in hebʹron his courage failed him and all the israelites were disturbed
2  there were two men in charge of the marauder bands that belonged to the son of saul one was named baʹanah and the other reʹchab
they were sons of rimʹmon the beerʹothite of the tribe of benjamin
for beerʹoth too used to be counted as part of benjamin
3  the beerʹothites ran away to gitʹtaim and they are foreign residents there down to this day
4  now sauls son jonʹathan had a son whose feet were crippled
he was five years old when the report about saul and jonʹathan came from jezʹreel and his nurse picked him up and fled but as she was fleeing in panic he fell and was crippled
his name was mephibʹosheth
5  the sons of rimʹmon the beerʹothite reʹchab and baʹanah went to the house of ishboʹsheth during the hot part of the day as he was taking his midday rest
6  they went into the house as if they were getting wheat and they struck him in the abdomen then reʹchab and his brother baʹanah escaped
7  when they had entered the house he was lying on his bed in his bedroom and they struck him and put him to death after which they cut off his head
then they took his head and walked all night long on the road to the arʹabah
8  and they brought the head of ishboʹsheth to david at hebʹron and said to the king here is the head of ishboʹsheth the son of saul your enemy who sought your life
this day jehovah gives to my lord the king revenge on saul and his descendants
9  however david answered reʹchab and his brother baʹanah the sons of rimʹmon the beerʹothite and said to them as surely as jehovah is living the one who rescued me out of all distress
10  when someone reported to me here saul is dead and he thought he was bringing me good news i took hold of him and killed him in zikʹlag
that was the messengers reward he received from me
11  how much more so when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed should i not require his blood from your hands and rid the earth of you
12  david then ordered the young men to kill them
they cut off their hands and feet and hung them by the pool in hebʹron
but they took the head of ishboʹsheth and buried it in the burial place of abʹner in hebʹron
11  at the start of the year at the time when kings go on campaigns david sent joʹab and his servants and the entire army of israel to bring the amʹmonites to ruin and they besieged rabʹbah while david stayed in jerusalem
2  one evening david got up from his bed and walked around on the rooftop of the kings house
from the rooftop he saw a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful
3  david sent someone to inquire about the woman and he reported is this not bathsheʹba the daughter of eliʹam and the wife of uriʹah the hitʹtite
4  then david sent messengers to bring her
so she came in to him and he lay down with her
this happened while she was purifying herself from her uncleanness
afterward she returned to her house
5  the woman became pregnant and she sent a message to david i am pregnant
6  at this david sent a message to joʹab send to me uriʹah the hitʹtite
so joʹab sent uriʹah to david
7  when uriʹah came to him david asked him how joʹab was getting along how the troops were getting along and how the war was going
8  david then said to uriʹah go down to your house and relax
when uriʹah left the kings house the kings courtesy gift was sent after him
9  however uriʹah slept at the entrance of the kings house with all the other servants of his lord and he did not go down to his own house
10  so david was told uriʹah did not go down to his own house
at that david said to uriʹah have you not just returned from a journey why did you not go down to your own house
11  uriʹah replied to david the ark and israel and judah are dwelling in temporary shelters and my lord joʹab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field
so should i go into my own house to eat and drink and lie down with my wife as surely as you live and are alive i will not do this thing
12  then david said to uriʹah stay here also today and tomorrow i will send you away
so uriʹah stayed in jerusalem on that day and the following day
13  david then sent for him to come and eat and drink with him and he got him drunk
but in the evening he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord and he did not go down to his house
14  in the morning david wrote a letter to joʹab and sent it by the hand of uriʹah
15  he wrote in the letter put uriʹah in the front lines where the fighting is fiercest
then retreat from behind him so that he will be struck down and die
16  joʹab had been carefully watching the city and he stationed uriʹah where he knew there were mighty warriors
17  when the men of the city came out and fought against joʹab some of davids servants fell and uriʹah the hitʹtite was among those who died
18  joʹab now reported to david all the news about the war
19  he instructed the messenger when you finish speaking to the king about all the news of the war
20  the king may become angry and say to you why did you have to go so near to the city to fight did you not know that they would shoot from the top of the wall
21  who struck down abimʹelech the son of jerubʹbesheth was it not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from the top of the wall causing his death at theʹbez why did you have to go so close to the wall then say your servant uriʹah the hitʹtite also died
22  so the messenger went and told david everything that joʹab had sent him to tell
23  then the messenger told david their men overpowered us and they came out against us in the field but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate
24  and the archers were shooting at your servants from the top of the wall and some of the servants of the king died your servant uriʹah the hitʹtite also died
25  at that david said to the messenger say this to joʹab do not let this matter trouble you for the sword devours one as well as another
intensify your battle against the city and conquer it
and encourage him
26  when uriʹahs wife heard that her husband uriʹah had died she began to mourn her husband
27  as soon as the mourning period was over david sent for her and brought her to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son
but what david had done was very displeasing to jehovah
8  some time later david defeated the philisʹtines and subdued them and david took methʹegamʹmah out of the hands of the philisʹtines
2  he defeated the moʹabites and made them lie down on the ground and measured them with a line
he measured out two lines to be put to death and one full line to be kept alive
and the moʹabites became davids servants and brought tribute
3  david defeated hadadeʹzer the son of reʹhob the king of zoʹbah as he was on his way to restore his authority at the euphraʹtes river
4  david captured 1700 horsemen and 20000 foot soldiers from him
then david hamstrung all but 100 of the chariot horses
5  when the syrians of damascus came to help king hadadeʹzer of zoʹbah david struck down 22000 of the syrians
6  david then established garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became davids servants and brought tribute
jehovah gave david victory wherever he went
7  moreover david took the circular shields of gold from the servants of hadadeʹzer and brought them to jerusalem
8  from beʹtah and beroʹthai cities of hadadeʹzer king david took a great quantity of copper
9  now king toʹi of haʹmath heard that david had defeated the entire army of hadadeʹzer
10  so toʹi sent his son joʹram to king david to ask about his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought and defeated hadadeʹzer for hadadeʹzer had often fought against toʹi and he brought articles of silver gold and copper
11  king david sanctified these to jehovah along with the silver and the gold that he had sanctified from all the nations that he had subdued
12  from syria and moʹab from the amʹmonites the philisʹtines the amalʹekites and from the spoil of hadadeʹzer the son of reʹhob the king of zoʹbah
13  david also made a name for himself when he came back from striking down 18000 eʹdomites in the valley of salt
14  he established garrisons in eʹdom
in all eʹdom he established garrisons and all the eʹdomites became davids servants
jehovah gave david victory wherever he went
15  david kept reigning over all israel and david was administering justice and righteousness for all his people
16  joʹab the son of zeruʹiah was over the army and jehoshʹaphat the son of ahiʹlud was recorder
17  zaʹdok the son of ahiʹtub and ahimʹelech the son of abiʹathar were priests and seraiʹah was secretary
18  benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada was over the cherʹethites and the pelʹethites
and davids sons became chief ministers
16  when david had passed a little beyond the summit ziʹba the attendant of mephibʹosheth was there to meet him with a couple of saddled donkeys and on them were 200 loaves of bread 100 cakes of raisins 100 cakes of summer fruit and a large jar of wine
2  then the king said to ziʹba why have you brought these things ziʹba replied the donkeys are for the household of the king to ride the bread and the summer fruit are for the young men to eat and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the wilderness to drink
3  the king now said and where is the son of your master at this ziʹba said to the king he is staying in jerusalem for he said today the house of israel will give back the royal rule of my father to me
4  the king then said to ziʹba look everything that belongs to mephibʹosheth is yours
ziʹba replied i bow down before you
may i find favor in your eyes my lord the king
5  when king david reached bahuʹrim a man of the family of sauls house named shimʹei the son of geʹra came out shouting curses as he approached
6  he was throwing stones at david and at all the servants of king david as well as at all the people and the mighty men on his right and on his left
7  shimʹei said as he cursed get out get out you bloodguilty man you worthless man
8  jehovah has brought back on you all the bloodguilt for the house of saul in whose place you have ruled as king but jehovah gives the kingship into the hand of abʹsalom your son
now calamity has overtaken you because you are a bloodguilty man
9  then abishʹai the son of zeruʹiah said to the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over please and take off his head
10  but the king said what do i have to do with you you sons of zeruʹiah let him curse me for jehovah has said to him curse david so who should say why are you doing this
11  david then said to abishʹai and all his servants here my own son who came from my own body is seeking my life and how much more now a benʹjaminite leave him alone so that he may curse me for jehovah told him to
12  perhaps jehovah will see my affliction and jehovah will restore goodness to me instead of the curses shouted at me this day
13  with that david and his men kept going down the road while shimʹei was walking alongside the mountain abreast of him shouting curses and throwing stones and a lot of dust
14  at length the king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted and they refreshed themselves
15  meanwhile abʹsalom and all the men of israel arrived in jerusalem and ahithʹophel was with him
16  when huʹshai the arʹchite davids friend came in to abʹsalom huʹshai said to abʹsalom long live the king long live the king
17  at this abʹsalom said to huʹshai is this your loyal love toward your friend why did you not go with your friend
18  so huʹshai said to abʹsalom no i am on the side of the one who has been chosen by jehovah this people and all the men of israel
i will stay with him
19  and again i say whom should i serve should it not be his son just as i served your father so i will serve you
20  abʹsalom then said to ahithʹophel give me your advice
what should we do
21  at that ahithʹophel said to abʹsalom have relations with your fathers concubines those whom he left behind to take care of the house
then all israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father and those who support you will be strengthened
22  so they pitched a tent for abʹsalom on the roof and abʹsalom had relations with the concubines of his father before the eyes of all israel
23  in those days the advice that ahithʹophel gave was considered as the word of the true god
that was how all the advice of ahithʹophel was esteemed both by david and by abʹsalom
18  then david numbered the men who were with him and placed over them chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds
2  and david sent one third of the men under the command of joʹab one third under the command of joʹabs brother abishʹai the son of zeruʹiah and one third under the command of itʹtai the gitʹtite
the king then said to the men i will also go out with you
3  but they said you must not go out for if we flee they would not care about us and if half of us would die they would not care about us because you are worth 10000 of us
therefore it would be better if you would send us help from the city
4  the king said to them whatever seems best to you i will do
so the king stood next to the city gate and all the men went out by hundreds and by thousands
5  then the king gave joʹab and abishʹai and itʹtai this order deal gently with the young man abʹsalom for my sake
all the men heard it when the king gave all the chiefs the order about abʹsalom
6  the men went out to the field to meet israel and the battle took place in the forest of eʹphraim
7  there the people of israel were defeated by the servants of david and a great slaughter took place on that day20000 men
8  the battle spread through the whole region
furthermore the forest devoured more of the people than the sword did on that day
9  abʹsalom eventually found himself facing the servants of david
abʹsalom was riding on a mule and the mule went under the thick branches of a large tree and his head got entangled in the big tree so that he was suspended in midair while the mule he had been riding kept going
10  then someone saw it and told joʹab look i have seen abʹsalom hanging in a big tree
11  joʹab replied to the man who told him if you saw it why did you not strike him down to the ground on the spot then i would have gladly given you ten pieces of silver and a belt
12  but the man said to joʹab even if i were handed 1000 pieces of silver i could not lift my hand against the kings son for we heard the king order you and abishʹai and itʹtai whoever you are watch over the young man abʹsalom
13  if i had disobeyed and taken his life it could never have remained hidden from the king and you would not have protected me
14  to this joʹab said i am not going to waste any more time with you so he took three spikes in his hand and drove them through the heart of abʹsalom while he was still alive in the midst of the big tree
15  then ten attendants who carried joʹabs weapons came and struck abʹsalom until he was dead
16  joʹab now blew the horn and the men returned from chasing after israel joʹab called for them to halt
17  they took abʹsalom and threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up over him a very big heap of stones
and all israel fled to their homes
18  now abʹsalom while he was alive had taken and set up for himself a pillar in the valley of the king for he said i have no son to preserve the memory of my name
so he named the pillar after himself and it is called abʹsaloms monument to this day
19  ahimʹaaz the son of zaʹdok said let me run please and break the news to the king for jehovah has given him justice by freeing him from his enemies
20  but joʹab said to him you will not be a bearer of news this day
you may break the news on another day but today you will not break the news because the kings own son has died
21  then joʹab said to a cushʹite go tell the king what you have seen
at that the cushʹite bowed to joʹab and ran off
22  ahimʹaaz the son of zaʹdok said once again to joʹab whatever happens please let me also run behind the cushʹite
however joʹab said why should you run my son when there is no news for you to tell
23  still he said whatever happens let me run
so joʹab said to him run and ahimʹaaz ran by the way of the district of the jordan and he eventually overtook the cushʹite
24  now david was sitting between the two city gates and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall
he looked up and saw a man running by himself
25  so the watchman called out and told the king
the king said if he is by himself he has news to tell
as he came steadily nearer
26  the watchman saw another man running
the watchman then called to the gatekeeper look another man running by himself the king said this one is also bringing news
27  the watchman said i can see that the first man runs like ahimʹaaz the son of zaʹdok so the king said he is a good man and he comes with good news
28  ahimʹaaz then called out to the king all is well with that he bowed to the king with his face to the ground
then he said may jehovah your god be praised who has surrendered the men who rebelled against my lord the king
29  however the king said is everything all right with the young man abʹsalom to this ahimʹaaz said i saw the great commotion when joʹab sent the kings servant and your servant but i did not know what it was
30  so the king said step aside stand here
at that he stepped aside and stood there
31  then the cushʹite arrived and the cushʹite said let my lord the king accept this news today jehovah has brought justice by freeing you from the hand of all those who rebelled against you
32  but the king said to the cushʹite is everything all right with the young man abʹsalom to this the cushʹite said may all the enemies of my lord the king and all those who rebelled against you to harm you become like the young man
33  this disturbed the king and he went up to the roof chamber over the gateway and wept saying as he walked my son abʹsalom my son my son abʹsalom if only i had died instead of you abʹsalom my son my son
17  ahithʹophel then said to abʹsalom please let me choose 12000 men and rise up and chase after david tonight
2  i will come upon him when he is weary and powerless and i will throw him into a panic and all the people who are with him will flee and i will strike down only the king
3  then i will bring all the people back to you
the return of all the people depends on what happens with the man you are seeking
then all the people will be at peace
4  the proposal was just right in the eyes of abʹsalom and all the elders of israel
5  however abʹsalom said please call huʹshai the arʹchite as well and let us hear what he has to say
6  so huʹshai came in to abʹsalom
then abʹsalom said to him this is the advice ahithʹophel gave
should we act on his advice if not you tell us
7  at this huʹshai said to abʹsalom the advice that ahithʹophel gave is not good in this instance
8  huʹshai continued you well know that your father and his men are mighty and they are desperate like a bear that has lost her cubs in the field
moreover your father is a warrior and he will not spend the night with the people
9  at this very moment he is hiding in one of the caves or in some other place and if he attacks first those hearing of it will say the people following abʹsalom have been defeated
10  even the courageous man whose heart is like that of a lion will surely melt in fear for all israel knows that your father is a mighty man and that the men with him are courageous
11  i give this advice let all israel be gathered to you from dan to beʹersheʹba as many as the grains of sand by the sea and you should lead them into the fight
12  we will come against him wherever he is found and we will come upon him just like the dew that falls on the ground and not one of them will survive not he nor any of the men with him
13  if he retreats into a city all israel will carry ropes to that city and we will drag it down into the valley until not even a pebble is left
14  then abʹsalom and all the men of israel said the advice of huʹshai the arʹchite is better than the advice of ahithʹophel for jehovah had determined to frustrate the sound advice of ahithʹophel so that jehovah could bring disaster on abʹsalom
15  huʹshai later said to zaʹdok and abiʹathar the priests this is what ahithʹophel has advised abʹsalom and the elders of israel and this is what i have advised
16  now quickly send word to david and warn him do not stay at the fords of the wilderness tonight but cross over without fail or the king and all the people with him may be wiped out
17  jonʹathan and ahimʹaaz were staying at enroʹgel so a servant girl went off and told them and they went to tell king david for they did not dare to be seen entering the city
18  however a young man saw them and told abʹsalom
so the two of them quickly went off and came to the house of a man in bahuʹrim who had a well in his courtyard
they went down into it
19  and the mans wife spread a covering over the top of the well and covered it with cracked grain no one knew about it
20  the servants of abʹsalom came to the woman at her house and asked where are ahimʹaaz and jonʹathan the woman replied they passed by toward the water
then the men searched for them but did not find them so they returned to jerusalem
21  after the men were gone they came up out of the well and went and informed king david
they said to him rise up and quickly cross the water for this is what ahithʹophel advised against you
22  immediately david and all the people with him rose up and crossed the jordan
by daybreak there was no one left who had not crossed the jordan
23  when ahithʹophel saw that his advice had not been acted on he saddled a donkey and went to his house in his hometown
after he gave instructions to his household he hanged himself
so he died and was buried in the burial place of his forefathers
24  meanwhile david went to mahanaʹim and abʹsalom crossed the jordan with all the men of israel
25  abʹsalom put amaʹsa in charge of the army in place of joʹab amaʹsa was the son of a man named ithʹra the israelite who had relations with abʹigail the daughter of naʹhash the sister of zeruʹiah joʹabs mother
26  israel and abʹsalom camped in the land of gilʹead
27  as soon as david came to mahanaʹim shoʹbi the son of naʹhash from rabʹbah of the amʹmonites maʹchir the son of amʹmiel from lodeʹbar and barzilʹlai the gilʹeadite from rogeʹlim
28  brought beds basins clay pots wheat barley flour roasted grain broad beans lentils parched grain
29  honey butter sheep and cheese
they brought all of this out for david and the people with him to eat for they said the people are hungry and tired and thirsty in the wilderness
9  david then said is there anyone still left of the house of saul to whom i may show loyal love for the sake of jonʹathan
2  now there was a servant of the house of saul named ziʹba
so they called him to david and the king asked him are you ziʹba he replied i am your servant
3  the king continued is there anyone left of the house of saul to whom i may extend gods loyal love ziʹba replied to the king there is still one son of jonʹathan he is crippled in both feet
4  the king asked him where is he ziʹba replied to the king he is in the house of maʹchir the son of amʹmiel at lodeʹbar
5  king david immediately sent for him and took him from the house of maʹchir the son of amʹmiel at lodeʹbar
6  when mephibʹosheth the son of jonʹathan the son of saul came in to david he at once fell facedown and prostrated himself
then david said mephibʹosheth to which he replied here is your servant
7  david said to him do not be afraid for i will certainly show loyal love to you for the sake of your father jonʹathan and i will return to you all the land of saul your grandfather and you will always dine at my table
8  at that he prostrated himself and said what is your servant that you have turned your attention to a dead dog like me
9  the king now sent for ziʹba sauls attendant and said to him everything that belonged to saul and to all his house i give to the grandson of your master
10  you will cultivate the land for himyou and your sons and your servantsand you will gather its produce to provide food for those who belong to the grandson of your master to eat
but mephibʹosheth the grandson of your master will always dine at my table
now ziʹba had 15 sons and 20 servants
11  then ziʹba said to the king your servant will do all that my lord the king commands his servant to do
so mephibʹosheth ate at davids table like one of the sons of the king
12  now mephibʹosheth also had a young son named miʹca and all those who lived in ziʹbas house became servants of mephibʹosheth
13  and mephibʹosheth lived in jerusalem for he always ate at the table of the king and he was crippled in both feet
7  when the king was settled in his own house and jehovah had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies
2  the king said to nathan the prophet here i am living in a house of cedars while the ark of the true god sits in the midst of tent cloths
3  nathan replied to the king go and do whatever is in your heart for jehovah is with you
4  on that very night the word of jehovah came to nathan saying
5  go and say to my servant david this is what jehovah says should you build me a house to dwell in
6  for i have not dwelled in a house from the day i brought the people of israel out of egypt to this day but i have been moving about in a tent and in a tabernacle
7  during all the time that i went with all the israelites did i ever say one word to any of the tribal leaders of israel whom i appointed to shepherd my people israel saying why did you not build a house of cedars for me
8  now say this to my servant david this is what jehovah of armies says i took you from the pastures from following the flock to become a leader over my people israel
9  and i will be with you wherever you go and i will do away with all your enemies from before you and i will make a great name for you like the name of the great men of the earth
10  i will appoint a place for my people israel and settle them and they will live there and not be disturbed anymore and wicked men will not oppress them again as they did in the past
11  from the day that i appointed judges over my people israel
and i will give you rest from all your enemies
also jehovah has told you that jehovah will make a house for you
12  when your days come to an end and you are laid to rest with your forefathers then i will raise up your offspring after you your own son and i will firmly establish his kingdom
13  he is the one who will build a house for my name and i will firmly establish the throne of his kingdom forever
14  i will become his father and he will become my son
when he does wrong i will reprove him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of men
15  my loyal love will not be taken away from him the way i took it away from saul whom i removed from before you
16  your house and your kingdom will be secure forever before you your throne will be firmly established forever
17  nathan told david all these words and this entire vision
18  at that king david came in and sat down before jehovah and said who am i o sovereign lord jehovah and what is my house that you have brought me this far
19  as if this were not enough o sovereign lord jehovah you also speak about the house of your servant down to a distant future time and this is instruction for all mankind o sovereign lord jehovah
20  what more can your servant david say to you when you know me so well o sovereign lord jehovah
21  for the sake of your word and in agreement with your heart you have done all these great things and have revealed them to your servant
22  that is why you are truly great o sovereign lord jehovah
there is no one like you and there is no god except you everything we have heard with our ears confirms this
23  and what other nation on earth is like your people israel god went and redeemed them as his people making a name for himself by doing great and aweinspiring things for them
you drove out the nations and their gods in behalf of your people whom you redeemed to yourself from egypt
24  you established your people israel as your own people for all time and you o jehovah have become their god
25  now o jehovah god carry out the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house for all time and may you do just as you have promised
26  may your name be exalted forever so that people may say jehovah of armies is god over israel and may the house of your servant david be firmly established before you
27  for you jehovah of armies the god of israel have made a revelation to your servant by saying i will build a house for you
that is why your servant has the courage to pray this prayer to you
28  and now o sovereign lord jehovah you are the true god and your words are truth and you have promised these good things to your servant
29  so may it please you to bless the house of your servant and may it continue forever before you for you o sovereign lord jehovah have promised and with your blessing may the house of your servant be blessed forever
23  these are the last words of david the word of david the son of jesʹseand the word of the man who was raised on highthe anointed of the god of jacobthe pleasant singer of the songs of israel
2  the spirit of jehovah spoke through mehis word was on my tongue
3  the god of israel spoketo me the rock of israel said when the one ruling over mankind is righteousruling in the fear of god
4  it is like the morning light when the sun shinesa morning without clouds
it is like the brightness after the rainmaking grass sprout from the earth
5  is not my house like that before god for he has made an eternal covenant with mearranged in every detail and secured
because it means my complete salvation and all my delightis that not why he makes it flourish
6  but worthless men are all thrown away like thornbushesfor they cannot be taken with the hand
7  when a man touches themhe should be fully armed with iron and the shaft of a spearand they should be completely burned up with fire in their place
8  these are the names of davids mighty warriors joʹshebbassheʹbeth a tahcheʹmonite the head of the three
he brandished his spear over 800 slain at one time
9  next to him eleaʹzar the son of doʹdo the son of ahoʹhi was among the three mighty warriors with david when they taunted the philisʹtines
they had gathered there for the battle and when the men of israel retreated
10  he stood his ground and kept striking down the philisʹtines until his arm grew weary and his hand became stiff from gripping the sword
so jehovah brought about a great victory on that day and the people returned behind him to strip the slain
11  next to him was shamʹmah the son of aʹgee the harʹarite
the philisʹtines gathered together at leʹhi where there was a plot of land full of lentils and the people fled because of the philisʹtines
12  but he took his stand in the middle of the field and defended it and kept striking down the philisʹtines so that jehovah brought about a great victory
13  three of the 30 headmen went down during the harvest to david at the cave of adulʹlam and a company of the philisʹtines was camped in the valley of rephʹaim
14  david was then in the stronghold and an outpost of the philisʹtines was in bethʹlehem
15  then david expressed his longing if only i could have a drink of the water from the cistern by the gate of bethʹlehem
16  at that the three mighty warriors forced their way into the camp of the philisʹtines and drew water from the cistern by the gate of bethʹlehem and brought it to david but he refused to drink it and poured it out to jehovah
17  he said it is unthinkable on my part o jehovah that i should do this should i drink the blood of the men going at the risk of their lives so he refused to drink it
these are the things that his three mighty warriors did
18  abishʹai the brother of joʹab the son of zeruʹiah was the head of another three he brandished his spear over 300 slain and he had a reputation like the three
19  although he was the most distinguished of the other three and he was their chief he did not attain to the rank of the first three
20  benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada was a courageous man who performed many exploits in kabʹzeel
he struck down the two sons of arʹiel of moʹab and he descended into a waterpit on a snowy day and killed a lion
21  he also struck down an egyptian man of extraordinary size
though the egyptian had a spear in his hand he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the egyptians hand and killed him with his own spear
22  these things benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada did and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors
23  although he was distinguished even more than the thirty he did not attain to the rank of the three
however david appointed him over his own bodyguard
24  asʹahel the brother of joʹab was among the thirty elhaʹnan the son of doʹdo of bethʹlehem
25  shamʹmah the haʹrodite eliʹka the haʹrodite
26  heʹlez the palʹtite iʹra the son of ikʹkesh the tekoʹite
27  abieʹzer the anʹathothite mebunʹnai the huʹshathite
28  zalʹmon the ahoʹhite maʹharai the netophʹathite
29  heʹleb the son of baʹanah the netophʹathite itʹtai the son of riʹbai of gibʹeah of the benʹjaminites
30  benaiʹah a pirʹathonite hidʹdai of the wadis of gaʹash
31  aʹbialʹbon the arʹbathite azʹmaveth the barhuʹmite
32  eliʹahba the shaalʹbonite the sons of jaʹshen jonʹathan
33  shamʹmah the harʹarite ahiʹam the son of shaʹrar the harʹarite
34  eliphʹelet the son of ahasʹbai the son of the maacʹathite eliʹam the son of ahithʹophel the giʹlonite
35  hezʹro the carʹmelite paʹarai the arʹbite
36  iʹgal the son of nathan of zoʹbah baʹni the gadʹite
37  zeʹlek the amʹmonite naʹharai the beerʹothite the armorbearer of joʹab the son of zeruʹiah
38  iʹra the ithʹrite gaʹreb the ithʹrite
39  and uriʹah the hitʹtite37 in all
22  and david spoke to jehovah the words of this song in the day that jehovah rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of sauls hand
2  he said jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the one who rescues me
3  my god is my rock in whom i take refugemy shield and my horn of salvation my secure refugeand my place to flee my savior you who save me from violence
4  i call on jehovah who is worthy of praiseand i will be saved from my enemies
5  the waves of death broke all around meflash floods of worthless men terrified me
6  the ropes of the grave surrounded methe snares of death confronted me
7  in my distress i called on jehovahto my god i kept calling
then from his temple he heard my voiceand my cry for help reached his ears
8  back and forth the earth began to shake and rockthe foundations of the heavens trembledand shook back and forth because he had been angered
9  smoke ascended from his nostrilsand a consuming fire came from his mouthglowing coals blazed from him
10  he made the heavens bend as he descendedand thick gloom was beneath his feet
11  he rode on a cherub and came flying
he was visible on the wings of a spirit
12  then he put darkness around him as a shelterin dark waters and thick clouds
13  from the brightness before him fiery coals blazed
14  then jehovah began to thunder from heaventhe most high made his voice heard
15  he shot his arrows and scattered themlightning and he threw them into confusion
16  the bed of the sea became visiblethe foundations of the land were exposed by the rebuke of jehovahby the blast of the breath from his nostrils
17  he reached down from on highhe took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters
18  he rescued me from my strong enemyfrom those hating me who were stronger than i was
19  they confronted me on the day of my disasterbut jehovah was my support
20  he brought me out into a place of safetyhe rescued me because he was pleased with me
21  jehovah rewards me according to my righteousnesshe repays me according to the innocence of my hands
22  for i have kept the ways of jehovahand i have not wickedly abandoned my god
23  all his judgments are before mei will not deviate from his statutes
24  i will remain blameless before himand i will keep myself from error
25  may jehovah repay me according to my righteousnessaccording to my innocence before him
26  with someone loyal you act in loyaltywith the blameless mighty man you deal blamelessly
27  with the pure you show yourself purebut with the crooked you show yourself shrewd
28  for you save those who are humblebut your eyes are against the haughty and you abase them
29  for you are my lamp o jehovahit is jehovah who lights up my darkness
30  with your help i can charge against a marauder bandby gods power i can scale a wall
31  the way of the true god is perfectthe saying of jehovah is refined
he is a shield to all those taking refuge in him
32  for who is a god besides jehovah and who is a rock except our god
33  the true god is my strong fortressand he will make my way perfect
34  he makes my feet like those of a deerhe makes me stand on high places
35  he trains my hands for warfaremy arms can bend a bow of copper
36  you give me your shield of salvationand your humility makes me great
37  you widen the path for my footstepsmy feet will not slip
38  i will pursue my enemies and annihilate themi will not return until they are wiped out
39  and i will wipe them out and crush them so that they will not rise upthey will fall under my feet
40  you will equip me with strength for the battleyou will make my foes collapse under me
41  you will make my enemies retreat from mei will put an end to those who hate me
42  they cry for help but there is no one to save themthey even cry to jehovah but he does not answer them
43  i will pound them as fine as the dust of the earthi will pulverize and trample them like mud in the streets
44  you will rescue me from the faultfinding of my people
you will safeguard me to be the head of nationsa people whom i have not known will serve me
45  foreigners will come cringing before mewhat they hear about me will make them obey me
46  foreigners will lose couragethey will come trembling from their strongholds
47  jehovah is alive praised be my rock let the god of the rock of my salvation be exalted
48  the true god executes vengeance for mehe subdues the peoples under me
49  he rescues me from my enemies
you lift me high above those who attack meyou save me from the man of violence
50  that is why i will thank you o jehovah among the nationsand to your name i will sing praises
51  he performs great acts of salvation for his kinghe displays loyal love to his anointed oneto david and his offspring forever
6  david again gathered all the best troops in israel 30000 men
2  then david and all the men with him set out for baʹalejuʹdah to bring up from there the ark of the true god before which people call on the name of jehovah of armies who sits enthroned above the cherubs
3  however they placed the ark of the true god on a new wagon to transport it from the house of abinʹadab which was on the hill and uzʹzah and ahiʹo the sons of abinʹadab were leading the new wagon
4  so they transported the ark of the true god from abinʹadabs house on the hill and ahiʹo was walking ahead of the ark
5  david and all the house of israel were celebrating before jehovah with all sorts of juniperwood instruments harps other stringed instruments tambourines sistrums and cymbals
6  but when they came to the threshing floor of naʹcon uzʹzah thrust his hand out to the ark of the true god and grabbed hold of it for the cattle nearly upset it
7  at that jehovahs anger blazed against uzʹzah and the true god struck him down there for his irreverent act and he died there beside the ark of the true god
8  but david became angry because jehovahs wrath had broken through against uzʹzah and that place has been called peʹrezuzʹzah down to this day
9  so david became fearful of jehovah on that day and said how can the ark of jehovah come to me
10  david was not willing to bring the ark of jehovah to where he was in the city of david
instead david had it taken to the house of oʹbedeʹdom the gitʹtite
11  the ark of jehovah remained at the house of oʹbedeʹdom the gitʹtite for three months and jehovah kept blessing oʹbedeʹdom and all his household
12  the report was made to king david jehovah has blessed the house of oʹbedeʹdom and all that belongs to him because of the ark of the true god
so david went to bring the ark of the true god from the house of oʹbedeʹdom up to the city of david with rejoicing
13  when the carriers of the ark of jehovah had marched six steps he sacrificed a bull and a fattened animal
14  david was dancing around before jehovah with all his might all the while david wore a linen ephʹod
15  david and all the house of israel were bringing up the ark of jehovah with joyful shouting and with the sound of the horn
16  but when the ark of jehovah came into the city of david sauls daughter miʹchal looked down through the window and saw king david leaping and dancing around before jehovah and she began to despise him in her heart
17  so they brought the ark of jehovah in and set it in its place inside the tent that david had pitched for it
then david offered up burnt offerings and communion sacrifices before jehovah
18  when david finished offering up the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices he blessed the people in the name of jehovah of armies
19  further he distributed to all the people to the whole multitude of israel to each man and woman a ringshaped loaf of bread a date cake and a raisin cake and then all the people left each to his own house
20  when david returned to bless his own household sauls daughter miʹchal came out to meet him
she said how glorious the king of israel made himself when he uncovered himself today before the eyes of the slave girls of his servants just as an emptyheaded man openly uncovers himself
21  at this david said to miʹchal my celebration was before jehovah who chose me rather than your father and all his household and who appointed me as leader over jehovahs people israel
therefore i will celebrate before jehovah
22  and i will humble myself even more than this and become low even in my own eyes
but by the slave girls whom you mentioned i will be glorified
23  so sauls daughter miʹchal had no children down to the day of her death
21  now there was a famine in the days of david for three consecutive years so david consulted jehovah and jehovah said there is bloodguilt on saul and on his house because he put the gibʹeonites to death
2  so the king called the gibʹeonites and spoke to them
incidentally the gibʹeonites were not israelites but amʹorites who remained and the israelites had sworn to spare them but saul sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of israel and judah
3  david said to the gibʹeonites what should i do for you and how can i make atonement so that you will bless the inheritance of jehovah
4  the gibʹeonites said to him it is not a matter of silver or gold for us in connection with saul and his household nor can we put any man to death in israel
at that he said whatever you say i will do for you
5  they said to the king the man who exterminated us and schemed to annihilate us from living anywhere in the territory of israel
6  let seven of his sons be given to us
we will hang their dead bodies before jehovah in gibʹeah of saul the chosen one of jehovah
the king then said i will hand them over
7  however the king showed compassion for mephibʹosheth the son of jonʹathan the son of saul because of the oath made before jehovah between david and jonʹathan the son of saul
8  so the king took armoʹni and mephibʹosheth the two sons of rizʹpah the daughter of aʹiah whom she bore to saul and the five sons of miʹchal the daughter of saul whom she bore to aʹdriel the son of barzilʹlai the meholʹathite
9  then he handed them over to the gibʹeonites and they hung their dead bodies on the mountain before jehovah
all seven of them died together they were put to death in the first days of harvest at the start of the barley harvest
10  then rizʹpah the daughter of aʹiah took sackcloth and spread it out on the rock from the start of harvest until rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies she did not allow the birds of the heavens to land on them by day nor the wild beasts of the field to come near by night
11  david was told what sauls concubine rizʹpah the daughter of aʹiah had done
12  so david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of his son jonʹathan from the leaders of jaʹbeshgilʹead who had stolen them from the public square of bethshan where the philisʹtines had hung them on the day that the philisʹtines struck down saul on gilboʹa
13  he brought the bones of saul and the bones of his son jonʹathan up from there and they also gathered the bones of the men who had been executed
14  then they buried the bones of saul and of jonʹathan his son in the land of benjamin in zeʹla in the tomb of kish his father
after they did everything that the king had commanded god listened to their entreaties for the land
15  once again there was war between the philisʹtines and israel
so david and his servants went down and fought the philisʹtines but david became exhausted
16  a descendant of the rephʹaim named ishʹbibeʹnob whose copper spear weighed 300 shekels and who was armed with a new sword intended to strike david down
17  at once abishʹai the son of zeruʹiah came to his aid and struck the philisʹtine down and put him to death
at that time the men of david swore this oath to him you must not go out with us to battle anymore you must not extinguish the lamp of israel
18  after this war broke out again with the philisʹtines at gob
at that time sibʹbecai the huʹshathite struck down saph who was a descendant of the rephʹaim
19  and war broke out again with the philisʹtines at gob and elhaʹnan the son of jaʹareorʹegim the bethʹlehemite struck down goliʹath the gitʹtite whose spear had a shaft like the beam of loom workers
20  war broke out yet again at gath where there was a man of extraordinary size with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot 24 in all and he too was a descendant of the rephʹaim
21  he kept taunting israel
so jonʹathan the son of shimʹei davids brother struck him down
22  these four were descendants of the rephʹaim in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants
13  now davids son abʹsalom had a beautiful sister named taʹmar and davids son amʹnon fell in love with her
2  amʹnon was so distressed that he became sick because of his sister taʹmar for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible for amʹnon to do anything to her
3  now amʹnon had a companion named jehonʹadab the son of shimʹeah davids brother and jehonʹadab was a very clever man
4  so he said to him why are you the kings son so depressed every morning why not tell me amʹnon replied to him i am in love with taʹmar the sister of my brother abʹsalom
5  jehonʹadab replied to him lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick
when your father comes to see you say to him please let my sister taʹmar come and serve me some food
if she prepares the food given to the sick before my eyes i will eat it from her hand
6  so amʹnon lay down and pretended to be sick and the king came in to see him
then amʹnon said to the king please let my sister taʹmar come in and bake two heartshaped cakes before my eyes so that i may take food from her hand
7  at that david sent a message to taʹmar at the house saying please go to the house of your brother amʹnon and prepare food for him
8  so taʹmar went to the house of her brother amʹnon where he was lying down
she took the dough and kneaded it into cakes before his eyes and cooked the cakes
9  then she took the pan and served him
but amʹnon refused to eat and said have everybody leave me so everybody left him
10  amʹnon now said to taʹmar bring the food into the bedroom so that i may eat it from your hand
so taʹmar took the heartshaped cakes that she had made and brought them to her brother amʹnon in the bedroom
11  when she brought them for him to eat he grabbed her and said come lie down with me my sister
12  but she said to him no my brother do not humiliate me for such a thing is not done in israel
do not do this disgraceful thing
13  how could i live down my shame and you will be regarded as one of the disgraceful men in israel
now speak please to the king for he will not withhold me from you
14  but he refused to listen to her and he overpowered her and humiliated her by raping her
15  then amʹnon began hating her with a very intense hatred so that his hatred for her became greater than the love he had felt for her
amʹnon said to her get up go away
16  at this she said to him no my brother for sending me away now is worse than what you have done with me but he refused to listen to her
17  with that he called his young attendant and said get this person out of my presence please and lock the door behind her
18  now she was wearing a special robe for those were the garments that the virgin daughters of the king wore
so his attendant led her outside and he locked the door behind her
19  then taʹmar put ashes on her head and she ripped apart the fine robe she was wearing and she kept her hands on her head and walked off crying out as she walked
20  at this her brother abʹsalom asked her was it your brother amʹnon who was with you and now keep silent my sister
he is your brother
do not let your heart dwell on this matter
then taʹmar lived in isolation at the house of her brother abʹsalom
21  when king david heard about all these things he became very angry
but he would not hurt the feelings of amʹnon his son because he loved him for he was his firstborn
22  and abʹsalom said nothing to amʹnon either bad or good for abʹsalom hated amʹnon because he had humiliated his sister taʹmar
23  after two full years abʹsaloms sheepshearers were at baʹalhaʹzor near eʹphraim and abʹsalom invited all the sons of the king
24  so abʹsalom came in to the king and said your servant is having his sheep sheared
please let the king and his servants go with me
25  but the king said to abʹsalom no my son
if all of us go we will be a burden to you
although he kept urging him he did not consent to go but he blessed him
26  abʹsalom then said if not you please let my brother amʹnon go with us
the king replied to him why should he go with you
27  but abʹsalom urged him so he sent amʹnon and all the kings sons with him
28  then abʹsalom ordered his attendants watch and when amʹnons heart is in a cheerful mood from the wine i will say to you strike down amʹnon you must then put him to death
do not be afraid
is it not i who command you be strong and courageous
29  so abʹsaloms attendants did to amʹnon exactly as abʹsalom had ordered then all the other sons of the king got up and each one mounted his mule and fled
30  while they were on the way the report reached david abʹsalom has struck down all the sons of the king and not one of them survived
31  at this the king got up and ripped his clothes apart and lay on the ground and all his servants were standing by with their garments ripped apart
32  however jehonʹadab the son of shimʹeah davids brother said do not let my lord think that they have killed all the young sons of the king for only amʹnon has died
this is by the order of abʹsalom who decided to do this from the day that amʹnon humiliated his sister taʹmar
33  now do not let my lord the king pay attention to the report that says all the kings sons have died only amʹnon has died
34  meanwhile abʹsalom ran away
later the watchman raised his eyes and saw that there were many people coming from the road behind him next to the mountain
35  at this jehonʹadab said to the king look the kings sons have returned
it is just as your servant said
36  as he finished speaking the kings sons came in weeping loudly also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly
37  but abʹsalom fled and went to talʹmai the son of ammiʹhud the king of geshʹur
david mourned his son for many days
38  after abʹsalom fled and went to geshʹur he stayed there for three years
39  finally king david longed to go to abʹsalom for he had become reconciled to the death of amʹnon
14  now joʹab the son of zeruʹiah learned that the kings heart longed for abʹsalom
2  so joʹab sent to tekoʹa and summoned from there a clever woman and told her act like you are in mourning please and put on garments of mourning and do not rub yourself with oil
behave like a woman who has been mourning over someone dead for a long time
3  then go in and speak to the king like this
with that joʹab put the words in her mouth
4  the tekoʹite woman went in to the king and fell with her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said help me o king
5  the king replied to her what is the matter to this she said alas i am a widow my husband is dead
6  and i your servant had two sons and the two of them fought with each other in the field
there was no one to separate them and one struck the other down and killed him
7  now the whole family has risen up against me your servant and they are saying hand over the one who struck his brother so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed even if it means wiping out the heir they would extinguish the last glowing coal that i have left and leave to my husband neither a name nor a survivor on the surface of the earth
8  then the king said to the woman go to your home and i will issue an order regarding you
9  at this the tekoʹite woman said to the king o my lord the king let the guilt be on me and on my fathers house while the king and his throne are innocent
10  the king then said if anyone speaks further to you bring him to me and he will never trouble you again
11  but she said please let the king remember jehovah your god so that the avenger of blood does not bring ruin and annihilate my son
to this he said as surely as jehovah is living not one of your sons hairs will fall to the ground
12  the woman now said let your servant please speak a word to my lord the king
so he said speak
13  the woman said why then have you thought to do something like this against the people of god when the king speaks this way he makes himself guilty for the king does not bring back his own banished son
14  we will surely die and be like waters that are poured out on the ground which cannot be recovered
but god would not take away a life and he considers reasons why the banished one should not always be banished from him
15  i have come in to say this to my lord the king because the people made me afraid
so your servant said let me speak please to the king
perhaps the king will act on the request of his slave
16  the king may listen and rescue his slave from the hand of the man seeking to annihilate me and my only son from the inheritance god gave us
17  then your servant said may the word of my lord the king please give me relief for my lord the king is just like an angel of the true god in distinguishing what is good from what is bad
may jehovah your god be with you
18  the king now answered the woman please do not hide from me anything i ask you
the woman replied let my lord the king speak please
19  the king then asked did joʹab put you up to all of this the woman answered as surely as you are living o my lord the king it is just as my lord the king says for it was your servant joʹab who instructed me and put all these words in the mouth of your servant
20  your servant joʹab has done this to change the appearance of things but my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of the true god and knows all that is happening in the land
21  the king then said to joʹab all right i will do this thing
go and bring back the young man abʹsalom
22  at this joʹab fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and praised the king
joʹab said today your servant knows that i have found favor in your eyes o my lord the king because the king has acted on the request of his servant
23  then joʹab got up and went to geshʹur and brought abʹsalom to jerusalem
24  however the king said let him return to his own house but he may not see my face
so abʹsalom returned to his own house and he did not see the face of the king
25  now in all israel no man was as highly praised for his handsome appearance as abʹsalom
from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no flaw in him
26  when he shaved his headhe had to shave it at the end of every year because it was so heavy for himthe hair of his head weighed 200 shekels by the royal stone weight
27  to abʹsalom were born three sons and one daughter whose name was taʹmar
she was a very beautiful woman
28  and abʹsalom continued living in jerusalem for two full years but he did not see the face of the king
29  so abʹsalom summoned joʹab in order to send him to the king but joʹab would not come to him
then he sent for him again a second time and he still refused to come
30  finally he said to his servants joʹabs plot of land is next to mine and he has some barley there
go and set it on fire
so the servants of abʹsalom set the plot of land on fire
31  at this joʹab got up and came to abʹsaloms house and said to him why did your servants set my plot of land on fire
32  abʹsalom replied to joʹab look i sent this message to you come and let me send you to the king to ask why have i come from geshʹur it would have been better for me to stay there
now let me see the face of the king and if there is guilt in me then he should put me to death
33  so joʹab went in to the king and told him
then he called abʹsalom who came in to the king and prostrated himself before him falling with his face to the ground before the king
then the king kissed abʹsalom
19  it was reported to joʹab the king is weeping and mourning for abʹsalom
2  so the victory on that day was turned into mourning for all the people because they heard that the king was grieving over his son
3  the people quietly returned to the city that day like people who are ashamed because they fled in the battle
4  the king covered his face and kept crying out with a loud voice my son abʹsalom abʹsalom my son my son
5  then joʹab went in to the king at the house and said today you have put to shame all your servants who this day saved your life and the lives of your sons your daughters your wives and your concubines
6  you love those who hate you and hate those who love you for you have made it clear today that your chiefs and servants mean nothing to you because i am sure that if only abʹsalom were alive today and the rest of us were dead it would be all right with you
7  now get up go out and reassure your servants because by jehovah i swear that if you do not go out not a man will remain with you tonight
this will be worse for you than all the injury that has come upon you from your youth until now
8  so the king rose up and sat in the city gate and all the people were informed now the king is sitting in the gate
then all the people came before the king
but israel had fled each to his home
9  all the people in all the tribes of israel were disputing saying the king saved us from our enemies and he rescued us from the philisʹtines but now he has fled the land because of abʹsalom
10  and abʹsalom whom we anointed over us has died in the battle
so now why are you doing nothing to bring the king back
11  king david sent this message to zaʹdok and abiʹathar the priests speak to the elders of judah saying why should you be the last ones to bring the king back to his house when the word of all israel has come to the king at his house
12  you are my brothers you are my own bone and flesh
why should you be the last ones to bring the king back
13  and you should say to amaʹsa are you not my own bone and flesh so may god do to me and add to it if you will not become my army chief from now on instead of joʹab
14  so he won over the hearts of all the men of judah as one man and they sent word to the king come back you and all your servants
15  the king started back and reached the jordan and the people of judah came to gilʹgal to meet the king and to escort him across the jordan
16  then shimʹei the son of geʹra the benʹjaminite from bahuʹrim hurried down with the men of judah to meet king david
17  and there were 1000 men from benjamin with him
also ziʹba the attendant of the house of saul with his 15 sons and 20 servants rushed down to the jordan ahead of the king
18  he crossed the ford to bring the kings household across and to do whatever he desired
but shimʹei the son of geʹra fell down before the king when he was about to cross the jordan
19  he said to the king do not let my lord hold me guilty and do not remember the wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem
may the king not take it to heart
20  for your servant well knows that i have sinned so today i have been the first of all the house of joseph to come down to meet my lord the king
21  at once abishʹai the son of zeruʹiah said should not shimʹei be put to death for this because he cursed the anointed of jehovah
22  but david said what does this have to do with you you sons of zeruʹiah that you should act against me today should anyone be put to death today in israel for do i not know that today i am king over israel
23  then the king said to shimʹei you will not die
and the king gave him his oath
24  mephibʹosheth the grandson of saul also came down to meet the king
he had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his garments from the day the king left until the day he returned in peace
25  when he came to jerusalem to meet the king the king said to him why did you not go with me mephibʹosheth
26  to this he said my lord the king my servant tricked me
for your servant had said let me get my donkey saddled so that i may ride on it and go with the king for your servant is crippled
27  but he slandered your servant to my lord the king
however my lord the king is like an angel of the true god so do whatever seems good to you
28  all the household of my father could have been doomed to death by my lord the king and yet you placed your servant among those eating at your table
so what right do i have to cry out further to the king
29  however the king said to him why keep on speaking like this i have decided that you and ziʹba should share the field
30  at this mephibʹosheth said to the king let him take it all now that my lord the king has come to his house in peace
31  then barzilʹlai the gilʹeadite came down from rogeʹlim to the jordan to escort the king to the jordan
32  barzilʹlai was very old 80 years of age and he supplied the king with food while he was staying in mahanaʹim for he was a very wealthy man
33  so the king said to barzilʹlai cross over with me and i will supply you with food in jerusalem
34  but barzilʹlai said to the king how many days of my life are left that i should go up with the king to jerusalem
35  i am 80 years old today
can i discern between good and bad can i your servant taste what i eat and drink can i still listen to the voice of male and female singers so why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king
36  it is enough that your servant could bring the king to the jordan
why should the king repay me with this reward
37  let your servant return please and let me die in my city near the burial place of my father and my mother
but here is your servant chimʹham
let him cross over with my lord the king and you may do for him what seems good to you
38  so the king said chimʹham will go across with me and i will do for him what seems good to you whatever you ask of me i will do for you
39  all the people now began to cross the jordan and when the king crossed the king kissed barzilʹlai and blessed him and barzilʹlai returned home
40  when the king went across to gilʹgal chimʹham crossed with him
all the people of judah and half the people of israel brought the king across
41  then all the men of israel approached the king and said to him why did our brothers the men of judah steal you away and bring the king and his household over the jordan along with all of davids men
42  all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is related to us
why are you angry over this have we eaten anything at the kings expense or has a gift been given to us
43  however the men of israel answered the men of judah we have ten parts in the king so that we have a greater claim in david than you have
why then have you treated us with contempt should we not have been first to bring our king back but the word of the men of judah prevailed over that of the men of israel
24  the anger of jehovah again blazed against israel when one incited david against them saying go take a count of israel and judah
2  so the king said to joʹab the chief of the army who was with him please go through all the tribes of israel from dan to beʹersheʹba and register the people so that i may know the number of the people
3  but joʹab said to the king may jehovah your god multiply the people 100 times and may the eyes of my lord the king see it but why does my lord the king want to do such a thing
4  but the kings word prevailed over joʹab and the chiefs of the army
so joʹab and the chiefs of the army went out from before the king to register the people of israel
5  they crossed the jordan and camped at aroʹer to the right of the city in the middle of the valley toward the gadʹites and on to jaʹzer
6  after that they went on to gilʹead and the land of tahʹtimhodʹshi and continued to danjaʹan and went around to siʹdon
7  then they went to the fortress of tyre and all the cities of the hiʹvites and of the caʹnaanites and finally they ended up in the negʹeb of judah at beʹersheʹba
8  thus they went through all the land and came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days
9  joʹab now gave to the king the number of the people who were registered
israel amounted to 800000 warriors armed with swords and the men of judah were 500000
10  but davids heart was struck with remorse after he had numbered the people
david then said to jehovah i have sinned greatly by doing this
and now jehovah please forgive your servants error for i have acted very foolishly
11  when david got up in the morning jehovahs word came to gad the prophet davids visionary saying
12  go and say to david this is what jehovah says i am giving you three options
choose the one that i should bring on you
13  so gad came in to david and told him should seven years of famine come on your land or should you flee for three months from your adversaries while they pursue you or should there be three days of pestilence in your land now consider carefully what i should reply to the one who sent me
14  so david said to gad it is very distressing to me
let us fall please into the hand of jehovah for his mercy is great but do not let me fall into the hand of man
15  then jehovah sent a pestilence on israel from the morning until the designated time so that 70000 of the people from dan to beʹersheʹba died
16  when the angel stretched out his hand toward jerusalem to destroy it jehovah felt regret over the calamity and he said to the angel bringing destruction among the people it is enough now let your hand drop
jehovahs angel was close to the threshing floor of arauʹnah the jebʹusite
17  when david saw the angel who was striking the people down he said to jehovah i am the one who sinned and i am the one who did wrong but these sheepwhat have they done let your hand please come against me and my fathers house
18  so gad came in to david on that day and said to him go up set up for jehovah an altar on the threshing floor of arauʹnah the jebʹusite
19  so david went up at the word of gad as jehovah had commanded
20  when arauʹnah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming toward him arauʹnah immediately went out and bowed down to the king with his face to the ground
21  arauʹnah asked why has my lord the king come to his servant david replied to buy from you the threshing floor in order to build an altar to jehovah so that the scourge against the people may be halted
22  but arauʹnah said to david let my lord the king take it and offer up what seems good to him
here are cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing sledge and the equipment of the cattle for the wood
23  all of this o king arauʹnah gives to the king
then arauʹnah said to the king may jehovah your god show you favor
24  however the king said to arauʹnah no i must buy it from you for a price
i will not offer up to jehovah my god burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing
so david bought the threshing floor and the cattle for 50 silver shekels
25  and david built an altar there to jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices
jehovah then responded to the entreaty for the land and the scourge against israel was halted
5  in time all the tribes of israel came to david at hebʹron and said look we are your own bone and flesh
2  in times past while saul was our king you were the one who was leading israel on its campaigns
and jehovah said to you you will shepherd my people israel and you will become leader over israel
3  so all the elders of israel came to the king at hebʹron and king david made a covenant with them in hebʹron before jehovah
then they anointed david as king over israel
4  david was 30 years old when he became king and he reigned for 40 years
5  in hebʹron he reigned over judah for 7 years and 6 months and in jerusalem he reigned for 33 years over all israel and judah
6  and the king and his men set out for jerusalem against the jebʹusites who were inhabiting the land
they taunted david you will never come in here even the blind and the lame will drive you away
they thought david will never get in here
7  however david captured the stronghold of zion which is now the city of david
8  so david said on that day those who attack the jebʹusites should go through the water tunnel to strike down both the lame and the blind who are hateful to david that is why it is said the blind and the lame will never enter the house
9  then david took up residence in the stronghold and it was called the city of david and david began to build all around from the mound inward
10  thus david became greater and greater and jehovah the god of armies was with him
11  king hiʹram of tyre sent messengers to david also cedar timbers woodworkers and stonemasons for building walls and they began to build a house for david
12  and david knew that jehovah had firmly established him as king over israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people israel
13  david took more concubines and wives in jerusalem after he came from hebʹron and more sons and daughters were born to david
14  these are the names of those born to him in jerusalem shammuʹa shoʹbab nathan solʹomon
15  ibʹhar eliʹshua neʹpheg japhiʹa
16  elishʹama eliʹada and eliphʹelet
17  when the philisʹtines heard that david had been anointed as king over israel all the philisʹtines came up to search for david
when david heard about it he went down to the stronghold
18  then the philisʹtines came in and spread out in the valley of rephʹaim
19  david inquired of jehovah saying should i go up against the philisʹtines will you give them into my hand at this jehovah said to david go up for i will surely give the philisʹtines into your hand
20  so david came to baʹalperaʹzim and david struck them down there
at that he said jehovah has broken through my enemies before me like a breach made by waters
that is why he named that place baʹalperaʹzim
21  the philisʹtines abandoned their idols there and david and his men took them away
22  later the philisʹtines came up once again and spread out in the valley of rephʹaim
23  david inquired of jehovah but he said do not go directly up
instead go around behind them and come against them in front of the baʹca bushes
24  and when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baʹca bushes then act decisively for jehovah will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the philisʹtines
25  so david did just as jehovah commanded him and he struck down the philisʹtines from geʹba all the way to geʹzer
15  after all these things abʹsalom acquired for himself a chariot and horses and 50 men to run before him
2  abʹsalom would rise up early and stand at the side of the road to the city gate
whenever any man had a legal case that was to come to the king for judgment abʹsalom would call him and say from what city are you and he would say your servant is from one of the tribes of israel
3  abʹsalom would say to him see your claims are right and proper but there is no one from the king to hear your case
4  abʹsalom would say if only i were appointed judge in the land then every man who has a legal case or judgment could come to me and i would see that he receives justice
5  and when a man came near to bow down to him abʹsalom would extend his hand and grab hold of him and kiss him
6  abʹsalom would do this to all the israelites who would come in to the king for judgment so abʹsalom kept stealing the hearts of the men of israel
7  at the end of four years abʹsalom said to the king let me go please to hebʹron to pay my vow that i made to jehovah
8  for your servant made this solemn vow when i was dwelling in geshʹur in syria if jehovah will bring me back to jerusalem i will make an offering to jehovah
9  so the king said to him go in peace
with that he rose up and went to hebʹron
10  abʹsalom now sent spies through all the tribes of israel saying as soon as you hear the sound of the horn announce abʹsalom has become king in hebʹron
11  now 200 men from jerusalem had gone there with abʹsalom they were invited and went unsuspectingly unaware of what was happening
12  further when he offered the sacrifices abʹsalom sent for ahithʹophel the giʹlonite davids adviser from his city giʹloh
the conspiracy kept gaining momentum and the people who supported abʹsalom were growing in number
13  in time an informer came to david saying the heart of the men of israel has turned to abʹsalom
14  at once david said to all his servants with him in jerusalem get up and let us run away for none of us will escape from abʹsalom hurry for fear he may quickly overtake us and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the sword
15  the kings servants replied to the king whatever my lord the king decides your servants are ready to do
16  so the king went out with all his household following him but the king left ten concubines to take care of the house
17  and the king continued on his way out with all the people following and they stopped at bethmerʹhak
18  all his servants leaving with him and all the cherʹethites the pelʹethites and the gitʹtites 600 men who had followed him from gath were passing by as the king reviewed them
19  then the king said to itʹtai the gitʹtite why should you also go with us go back and dwell with the new king for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your place
20  yesterday you came so today should i make you wander with us to go when i must go and where i must go go back and take your brothers with you and may jehovah show you loyal love and faithfulness
21  but itʹtai answered the king as surely as jehovah is living and as surely as my lord the king is living wherever my lord the king may be whether for death or for life there your servant will be
22  at that david said to itʹtai go and cross over
so itʹtai the gitʹtite crossed over together with all his men and children
23  everyone in the land was weeping loudly while all these people crossed over and the king was standing by the kidʹron valley all the people were crossing over to the road leading to the wilderness
24  zaʹdok was also there and with him were all the levites carrying the ark of the covenant of the true god and they set the ark of the true god down and abiʹathar went up while all the people completed crossing over from the city
25  but the king said to zaʹdok take the ark of the true god back to the city
if i find favor in the eyes of jehovah he will also bring me back and let me see it and its dwelling place
26  but if he should say i have found no pleasure in you then let him do to me whatever seems good in his eyes
27  the king said to zaʹdok the priest are you not a seer return to the city in peace and take the two sons of you men with you ahimʹaaz your own son and jonʹathan the son of abiʹathar
28  see i will linger by the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me
29  so zaʹdok and abiʹathar took the ark of the true god back to jerusalem and they remained there
30  as david was going up the mount of olives he was weeping as he went up his head was covered and he was walking barefoot
all the people with him also covered their heads and were weeping as they went up
31  david was then told ahithʹophel is among those conspiring with abʹsalom
at this david said turn please the advice of ahithʹophel into foolishness o jehovah
32  when david came to the summit where people used to bow down to god huʹshai the arʹchite was there to meet him with his robe ripped apart and dirt on his head
33  however david said to him if you go across with me you will be a load on me
34  but if you return to the city and you say to abʹsalom i am your servant o king
i was the servant of your father in the past but now i am your servant you can then frustrate the advice of ahithʹophel for me
35  are not zaʹdok and abiʹathar the priests there with you you must tell zaʹdok and abiʹathar the priests everything that you hear from the house of the king
36  look there with them are their two sons ahimʹaaz the son of zaʹdok and jonʹathan the son of abiʹathar and through them send to me everything that you hear
37  so huʹshai davids friend went into the city as abʹsalom was entering into jerusalem
20  now there was a troublemaker named sheʹba the son of bichʹri a benʹjaminite
he blew the horn and said we have no share in david and we have no inheritance in the son of jesʹse
everyone to his gods o israel
2  at that all the men of israel quit following david to follow sheʹba the son of bichʹri but the men of judah stuck to their king from the jordan to jerusalem
3  when david came to his house at jerusalem the king took the ten concubines he had left behind to take care of the house and he put them in a house under guard
he supplied food to them but he did not have any relations with them
they remained in confinement until the day of their death living as if they were widows even though they had a living husband
4  the king now said to amaʹsa call the men of judah together to me within three days and you also should be here
5  so amaʹsa went to call judah together but he came later than the set time that had been appointed for him
6  then david said to abishʹai sheʹba the son of bichʹri may do us more harm than abʹsalom did
take the servants of your lord and chase after him so that he may not find fortified cities and escape from us
7  so the men of joʹab the cherʹethites the pelʹethites and all the mighty men went out after him they left jerusalem to chase after sheʹba the son of bichʹri
8  when they were near the great stone in gibʹeon amaʹsa came to meet them
now joʹab was wearing his battle clothing and he had a sword in its sheath strapped to his hip
when he stepped forward the sword fell out
9  joʹab said to amaʹsa are you all right my brother then with his right hand joʹab took hold of amaʹsas beard as if to kiss him
10  amaʹsa was not on guard against the sword that was in joʹabs hand and joʹab stabbed him with it in the abdomen and his intestines spilled out on the ground
he did not have to stab him again once was enough to kill him
then joʹab and his brother abishʹai chased after sheʹba the son of bichʹri
11  one of joʹabs young men stood by him and was saying whoever is on joʹabs side and whoever belongs to david let him follow joʹab
12  all the while amaʹsa was wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road
when the man saw that all the people were stopping he moved amaʹsa from the road to the field
then he threw a garment over him because he saw that everyone was stopping when they came up to him
13  after he had removed him from the road all the men followed joʹab to chase after sheʹba the son of bichʹri
14  sheʹba passed through all the tribes of israel to abel of bethmaʹacah
the bichʹrites gathered together and also went in after him
15  joʹab and his men came and besieged him in abel of bethmaʹacah and raised up a siege rampart against the city as it was standing within a rampart
and all the men with joʹab were undermining the wall to knock it down
16  and a wise woman called out from the city listen men listen please tell joʹab come here and let me speak to you
17  so he went near to her and the woman said are you joʹab he replied i am
at this she said to him listen to the words of your servant
he said i am listening
18  she continued they would always say in the past let them inquire in abel and that was the end of the matter
19  i represent the peaceable and faithful ones of israel
you are seeking to destroy a city that is like a mother in israel
why should you do away with the inheritance of jehovah
20  joʹab answered it is unthinkable for me to do away with it and destroy it
21  that is not the case at all
rather a man named sheʹba the son of bichʹri from the mountainous region of eʹphraim has rebelled against king david
if you hand over this one man i will withdraw from the city
then the woman said to joʹab look his head will be thrown over the wall to you
22  at once the wise woman went in to all the people and they cut off the head of sheʹba the son of bichʹri and threw it to joʹab
at that he blew the horn and they dispersed from the city each one to his home and joʹab returned to jerusalem to the king
23  now joʹab was in charge of all the army of israel benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada was over the cherʹethites and the pelʹethites
24  adoʹram was over those conscripted for forced labor jehoshʹaphat the son of ahiʹlud was the recorder
25  sheʹva was the secretary zaʹdok and abiʹathar were priests
26  and iʹra the jaʹirite also became a chief minister for david
1  after sauls death when david had returned from defeating the amalʹekites david stayed at zikʹlag for two days
2  on the third day a man came from the camp of saul with his garments ripped apart and dirt on his head
when he approached david he fell down to the ground and prostrated himself
3  david asked him where are you coming from he replied i have escaped from the camp of israel
4  david asked him how did things turn out please tell me
to this he said the people have fled from the battle and many have fallen and died
even saul and his son jonʹathan have died
5  then david asked the young man who brought him the news how do you know that saul and his son jonʹathan are dead
6  the young man replied by chance i was on mount gilboʹa and there was saul supporting himself on his spear and the chariots and horsemen had caught up with him
7  when he turned around and saw me he called me and i said here i am
8  he asked me who are you i replied i am an amalʹekite
9  then he said please stand over me and put me to death for i am in great agony but i am still alive
10  so i stood over him and put him to death for i knew that he could not survive after he had fallen down wounded
then i took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and i brought them here to my lord
11  at this david took hold of his garments and ripped them apart and so did all the men who were with him
12  and they wailed and wept and fasted until evening for saul for his son jonʹathan for the people of jehovah and for the house of israel because they had fallen by the sword
13  david asked the young man who brought him the news where are you from he said i am the son of a foreign resident an amalʹekite
14  then david said to him why did you not fear to lift your hand to do away with the anointed of jehovah
15  with that david called one of the young men and said step forward and strike him
so he struck him down and he died
16  david said to him your blood is on your own head because your own mouth testified against you by saying i myself put the anointed of jehovah to death
17  then david chanted this dirge over saul and his son jonʹathan
18  and said that the people of judah should be taught the dirge called the bow which is written in the book of jaʹshar
19  the beauty o israel lies slain upon your high places
how the mighty have fallen
20  do not tell it in gathdo not announce it in the streets of ashʹkelonor the daughters of the philisʹtines will rejoiceor the daughters of the uncircumcised men will exult
21  you mountains of gilboʹamay there be no dew or rain upon younor fields producing holy contributionsbecause there the shield of mighty ones was defiledthe shield of saul is no longer anointed with oil
22  from the blood of the slain from the fat of mighty onesthe bow of jonʹathan did not turn backand the sword of saul would not return without success
23  saul and jonʹathan beloved and cherished during their lifeand in death they were not separated
swifter than the eagles they weremightier than the lions
24  o daughters of israel weep over saulwho clothed you in scarlet and finerywho put gold ornaments upon your clothing
25  how the mighty have fallen in battle jonʹathan lies slain upon your high places
26  i am distressed over you my brother jonʹathanyou were very dear to me
more wonderful was your love to me than the love of women
27  how the mighty have fallenand the weapons of war have perished
2  afterward david inquired of jehovah saying should i go up into one of the cities of judah jehovah said to him go up
david then asked where should i go he replied to hebʹron
2  so david went up there with his two wives ahinʹoam of jezʹreel and abʹigail the widow of naʹbal the carʹmelite
3  david also brought the men who were with him each with his household and they settled in the cities around hebʹron
4  then the men of judah came and there they anointed david as king over the house of judah
they told david the men of jaʹbeshgilʹead were the ones who buried saul
5  so david sent messengers to the men of jaʹbeshgilʹead and said to them may you be blessed by jehovah because you showed loyal love to your lord saul by burying him
6  may jehovah show loyal love and faithfulness to you
i will also show you kindness because you have done this
7  now let your hands be strong and be courageous men for your lord saul is dead and the house of judah has anointed me as king over them
8  but abʹner the son of ner the chief of sauls army had taken sauls son ishboʹsheth and brought him across to mahanaʹim
9  and made him king over gilʹead the ashʹurites jezʹreel eʹphraim benjamin and over all israel
10  ishboʹsheth sauls son was 40 years old when he became king over israel and he reigned for two years
the house of judah however supported david
11  the time that david was king in hebʹron over the house of judah was seven years and six months
12  in time abʹner the son of ner and the servants of ishboʹsheth sauls son went out from mahanaʹim to gibʹeon
13  joʹab the son of zeruʹiah and the servants of david also went out and encountered them at the pool of gibʹeon and one group sat on this side of the pool and the other group on that side of the pool
14  finally abʹner said to joʹab let the young men get up and engage in combat before us
to this joʹab said let them get up
15  so they got up and crossed over by number 12 for benjamin and sauls son ishboʹsheth and 12 from the servants of david
16  they grabbed one another by the head and each of them thrust his sword into the side of his opponent and they all fell down together
so that place which is in gibʹeon was called helʹkathhazzuʹrim
17  the fighting that ensued was extremely fierce that day and abʹner and the men of israel were finally defeated before the servants of david
18  now the three sons of zeruʹiah were therejoʹab abishʹai and asʹahel and asʹahel was as swift on his feet as a gazelle in the open field
19  asʹahel chased after abʹner and he would not veer to the right or to the left in his pursuit of abʹner
20  when abʹner looked behind he asked is that you asʹahel to which he replied yes it is
21  then abʹner said to him veer to your right or to your left and capture one of the young men and take whatever you strip off him for yourself
but asʹahel did not want to stop chasing him
22  so abʹner said to asʹahel once again stop chasing me
why should i strike you down how could i look your brother joʹab in the face
23  but he kept refusing to stop so abʹner struck him in the abdomen with the butt end of the spear and the spear came out from his back and he fell there and died on the spot
everyone who came to the place where asʹahel fell and died would stop and pause there
24  then joʹab and abishʹai went in pursuit of abʹner
as the sun was setting they came to the hill of amʹmah which faces giʹah on the way to the wilderness of gibʹeon
25  there the benʹjaminites gathered together behind abʹner and they formed one company and made a stand on the top of a certain hill
26  then abʹner called out to joʹab is the sword going to devour endlessly do you not know that the outcome will only be bitterness how long then will it be before you tell the people to turn back from pursuing their brothers
27  at that joʹab said as surely as the true god is living if you had not spoken then only by the morning would the people have stopped pursuing their brothers
28  joʹab now blew the horn and his men stopped chasing after israel and the fighting ceased
29  abʹner and his men then marched through the arʹabah all that night and crossed the jordan and marched through the entire ravine and finally came to mahanaʹim
30  after joʹab turned back from pursuing abʹner he gathered all the people together
of davids servants 19 were missing in addition to asʹahel
31  but the servants of david had defeated the benʹjaminites and the men of abʹner and 360 of their men had died
32  they took asʹahel and buried him in his fathers tomb which is at bethʹlehem
then joʹab and his men marched all night long and they reached hebʹron at daybreak
3  the war between the house of saul and the house of david dragged on and david kept getting stronger and the house of saul grew steadily weaker
2  meanwhile sons were born to david in hebʹron
his firstborn was amʹnon by ahinʹoam of jezʹreel
3  his second was chilʹeab by abʹigail the widow of naʹbal the carʹmelite and the third was abʹsalom the son of maʹacah the daughter of talʹmai the king of geshʹur
4  the fourth was adoniʹjah the son of hagʹgith and the fifth was shephatiʹah the son of abiʹtal
5  the sixth was ithʹream by davids wife egʹlah
these were born to david in hebʹron
6  while the war between the house of saul and the house of david continued abʹner kept strengthening his position in the house of saul
7  now saul had had a concubine whose name was rizʹpah the daughter of aʹiah
ishboʹsheth later said to abʹner why did you have relations with the concubine of my father
8  abʹner grew very angry over the words of ishboʹsheth and said am i a dogs head from judah until this very day i have shown loyal love toward the house of your father saul and to his brothers and his friends and i have not betrayed you into the hand of david yet today you call me to account for an error concerning a woman
9  may god do so to abʹner and add to it if i do not do for david just as jehovah swore to him
10  to transfer the kingdom from the house of saul and to establish the throne of david over israel and over judah from dan to beʹersheʹba
11  he was not able to say one more word in reply to abʹner for he was afraid of him
12  abʹner immediately sent messengers to david saying to whom does the land belong he added make a covenant with me and i will do whatever i can to turn all israel to your side
13  to this he replied good i will make a covenant with you
the only thing i ask of you is that you do not try to see my face unless first you bring miʹchal sauls daughter when you come to see me
14  then david sent messengers to ishboʹsheth sauls son saying give me my wife miʹchal to whom i became engaged for 100 foreskins of the philisʹtines
15  so ishboʹsheth sent to take her from her husband palʹtiel the son of laʹish
16  but her husband kept walking with her weeping as he followed her as far as bahuʹrim
then abʹner said to him go return at that he returned
17  meanwhile abʹner sent word to the elders of israel saying for some time you wanted to have david as king over you
18  now act for jehovah said to david by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel from the hand of the philisʹtines and from the hand of all their enemies
19  then abʹner spoke to the people of benjamin
abʹner also went to speak privately to david at hebʹron to tell him what israel and the whole house of benjamin had agreed upon
20  when abʹner came to david at hebʹron with 20 men david held a feast for abʹner and for the men with him
21  then abʹner said to david let me go and gather all israel together to my lord the king so that they may make a covenant with you and you will become king over all that you desire
so david sent abʹner off and he went his way in peace
22  just then davids servants and joʹab returned from a raid bringing a great quantity of spoil back with them
abʹner was no longer with david in hebʹron for he had sent him on his way in peace
23  when joʹab and all the army that was with him arrived joʹab was told abʹner the son of ner came to the king and he sent him off and he went his way in peace
24  so joʹab went in to the king and said what have you done here abʹner came to you
why did you send him off so that he successfully got away
25  you know abʹner the son of ner he came here to fool you and to get to know your every move and to find out everything that you are doing
26  so joʹab left david and sent messengers after abʹner and they brought him back from the cistern of siʹrah but david did not know anything about it
27  when abʹner returned to hebʹron joʹab took him aside inside the gate to speak with him privately
however there he stabbed him in the abdomen and he died this was for killing his brother asʹahel
28  when david heard about it later he said i and my kingdom are forever innocent before jehovah of the bloodguilt for abʹner the son of ner
29  may it turn back on the head of joʹab and on the entire house of his father
may joʹabs house never be without a man suffering from a discharge or a leper or a man working at the spindle or one falling by the sword or one in need of food
30  so joʹab and his brother abishʹai killed abʹner because he had put asʹahel their brother to death in the battle at gibʹeon
31  then david said to joʹab and all the people with him rip your garments apart and tie on sackcloth and wail over abʹner
king david himself was walking behind the funeral bier
32  they buried abʹner in hebʹron and the king wept loudly at abʹners tomb and all the people gave way to weeping
33  the king chanted over abʹner and said should abʹner die the death of a senseless person
34  your hands had not been boundand your feet were not in fetters
you fell like one falling before criminals
at that all the people wept over him again
35  later all the people came to give david bread for consolation while it was still daytime but david swore may god do so to me and add to it if before the sun sets i taste bread or anything at all
36  all the people took notice and it pleased them
like everything that the king did it pleased all the people
37  so all the people and all israel knew on that day that the king was not responsible for having abʹner the son of ner put to death
38  then the king said to his servants do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in israel
39  today i am weak although anointed as king and these men the sons of zeruʹiah are too brutal for me
may jehovah repay the evildoer according to his own evil
12  so jehovah sent nathan to david
he came in to him and said there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor
2  the rich man had very many sheep and cattle
3  but the poor man had nothing but one small female lamb which he had bought
he cared for it and it grew up together with him and his sons
it would eat from the little food he had and drink from his cup and sleep in his arms
it became as a daughter to him
4  later a visitor came to the rich man but he would not take any of his own sheep and cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him
instead he took the poor mans lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him
5  at this david grew very angry against the man and he said to nathan as surely as jehovah is living the man who did this deserves to die
6  and he should pay for the lamb four times over because he did this and showed no compassion
7  then nathan said to david you are the man this is what jehovah the god of israel says i myself anointed you as king over israel and i rescued you from the hand of saul
8  i was willing to give you your masters house and put your masters wives in your arms and i gave you the house of israel and of judah
and as if that were not enough i was willing to do much more for you
9  why did you despise the word of jehovah by doing what is bad in his eyes you struck down uriʹah the hitʹtite with the sword then you took his wife as your wife after you killed him by the sword of the amʹmonites
10  now a sword will never depart from your own house because you despised me by taking the wife of uriʹah the hitʹtite as your wife
11  this is what jehovah says here i am bringing against you calamity from within your own house and before your own eyes i will take your wives and give them to another man and he will lie down with your wives in broad daylight
12  although you acted in secret i will do this in front of all israel and in broad daylight
13  david then said to nathan i have sinned against jehovah
nathan replied to david jehovah in turn forgives your sin
you will not die
14  nevertheless because you have treated jehovah with utter disrespect in this matter the son just born to you will certainly die
15  then nathan went to his own house
and jehovah struck the child whom uriʹahs wife had borne to david and he became sick
16  david pleaded with the true god in behalf of the boy
david went on a strict fast and would go in and spend the night lying on the ground
17  so the elders of his house stood over him and tried to raise him up from the ground but he refused and would not eat with them
18  on the seventh day the child died but davids servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead
they said while the child was alive we spoke to him and he did not listen to us
so how can we tell him that the child has died he may do something terrible
19  when david saw that his servants were whispering to one another he discerned that the child had died
david said to his servants has the child died they replied he has died
20  so david got up from the ground
he washed rubbed himself with oil changed his clothing and went to the house of jehovah and prostrated himself
afterward he went to his house and asked for food to be brought to him and he ate
21  his servants asked him why have you acted in this way while the child was alive you fasted and kept weeping but as soon as the child died you got up and ate food
22  he replied while the child was alive i fasted and kept weeping because i said to myself who knows whether jehovah may show me favor and let the child live
23  now that he has died why should i fast can i bring him back i will go to him but he will not return to me
24  then david comforted his wife bathsheʹba
he went in to her and lay down with her
in time she bore a son and he was named solʹomon
and jehovah loved him
25  and he sent word through nathan the prophet to name him jedidiʹah for the sake of jehovah
26  joʹab continued fighting against rabʹbah of the amʹmonites and he captured the royal city
27  so joʹab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabʹbah and i have captured the city of waters
28  now gather the rest of the troops and encamp against the city and capture it
otherwise i will be the one to capture the city and it will be credited to me
29  so david gathered all the troops and went to rabʹbah and fought against it and captured it
30  then he took the crown of malʹcam from its head
the weight of it was a talent of gold along with precious stones and it was placed on davids head
he also took a vast amount of spoil from the city
31  and he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work at sawing stones at working with sharp iron instruments and with iron axes and at brickmaking
that was what he did to all the cities of the amʹmonites
finally david and all the troops returned to jerusalem
