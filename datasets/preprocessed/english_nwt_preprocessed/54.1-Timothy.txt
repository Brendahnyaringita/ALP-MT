4  however the inspired word clearly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith paying attention to misleading inspired statements and teachings of demons
2  by means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies whose conscience is seared as with a branding iron
3  they forbid marriage and command people to abstain from foods that god created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth
4  for every creation of god is fine and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving
5  for it is sanctified through gods word and prayer over it
6  by giving this counsel to the brothers you will be a fine minister of christ jesus one nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching that you have followed closely
7  but reject irreverent false stories like those told by old women
on the other hand train yourself with godly devotion as your aim
8  for physical training is beneficial for a little but godly devotion is beneficial for all things as it holds promise of the life now and the life that is to come
9  that statement is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance
10  this is why we are working hard and exerting ourselves because we have rested our hope on a living god who is a savior of all sorts of men especially of faithful ones
11  keep on giving these commands and teaching them
12  never let anyone look down on your youth
instead become an example to the faithful ones in speaking in conduct in love in faith in chasteness
13  until i come continue applying yourself to public reading to exhortation to teaching
14  do not neglect the gift in you that was given you through a prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you
15  ponder over these things be absorbed in them so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people
16  pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching
persevere in these things for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you
6  let those who are under the yoke of slavery keep on considering their owners worthy of full honor so that the name of god and the teaching may never be spoken of injuriously
2  moreover let those having believing owners not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers
rather they should serve more readily because those receiving the benefit of their good service are believers and beloved
keep on teaching these things and giving these exhortations
3  if any man teaches another doctrine and does not agree with the wholesome instruction which is from our lord jesus christ nor with the teaching that is in harmony with godly devotion
4  he is puffed up with pride and does not understand anything
he is obsessed with arguments and debates about words
these things give rise to envy strife slander wicked suspicions
5  constant disputes about minor matters by men who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth thinking that godly devotion is a means of gain
6  to be sure there is great gain in godly devotion along with contentment
7  for we have brought nothing into the world and neither can we carry anything out
8  so having food and clothing we will be content with these things
9  but those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge men into destruction and ruin
10  for the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains
11  however you o man of god flee from these things
but pursue righteousness godly devotion faith love endurance and mildness
12  fight the fine fight of the faith get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses
13  before god who preserves all things alive and christ jesus who as a witness made the fine public declaration before pontius pilate i give you orders
14  to observe the commandment in a spotless and irreprehensible way until the manifestation of our lord jesus christ
15  which the happy and only potentate will show in its own appointed times
he is the king of those who rule as kings and lord of those who rule as lords
16  the one alone having immortality who dwells in unapproachable light whom no man has seen or can see
to him be honor and eternal might
amen
17  instruct those who are rich in the present system of things not to be arrogant and to place their hope not on uncertain riches but on god who richly provides us with all the things we enjoy
18  tell them to work at good to be rich in fine works to be generous ready to share
19  safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future so that they may get a firm hold on the real life
20  timothy guard what has been entrusted to you turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called knowledge
21  by making a show of such knowledge some have deviated from the faith
may the undeserved kindness be with you
5  do not severely criticize an older man
on the contrary appeal to him as a father to younger men as brothers
2  to older women as mothers to younger women as sisters with all chasteness
3  give consideration to widows who are truly widows
4  but if any widow has children or grandchildren let these learn first to practice godly devotion in their own household and to repay their parents and grandparents what is due them for this is acceptable in gods sight
5  now the woman who is truly a widow and left destitute has put her hope in god and continues in supplications and prayers night and day
6  but the one who gives herself to sensual gratification is dead though she is living
7  so keep on giving these instructions so that they may be irreprehensible
8  certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own and especially for those who are members of his household he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith
9  a widow is to be put on the list if she is not less than 60 years old was the wife of one husband
10  having a reputation for fine works if she raised children if she practiced hospitality if she washed the feet of holy ones if she assisted the afflicted if she devoted herself to every good work
11  on the other hand do not put younger widows on the list for when their sexual desires come between them and the christ they want to marry
12  and they will incur judgment because they have abandoned their first expression of faith
13  at the same time they also learn to be unoccupied going around from one house to another yes not only unoccupied but also gossipers and meddlers in other peoples affairs talking about things they should not
14  therefore i desire the younger widows to marry to bear children to manage a household to give no opportunity to the opposer to criticize
15  in fact some have already been turned aside to follow satan
16  if any believing woman has relatives who are widows let her assist them so that the congregation is not burdened
then it can assist those who are truly widows
17  let the elders who preside in a fine way be considered worthy of double honor especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching
18  for the scripture says you must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain also the worker is worthy of his wages
19  do not accept an accusation against an older man except on the evidence of two or three witnesses
20  reprove before all onlookers those who practice sin as a warning to the rest
21  i solemnly charge you before god and christ jesus and the chosen angels to observe these instructions without any prejudice or partiality
22  never lay your hands hastily on any man neither become a sharer in the sins of others keep yourself chaste
23  do not drink water any longer but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness
24  the sins of some men are publicly known leading directly to judgment but those of other men become evident later
25  in the same way also the fine works are publicly known and those that are otherwise cannot be kept hidden
1  paul an apostle of christ jesus by the command of god our savior and of christ jesus our hope
2  to timothy a genuine child in the faith may you have undeserved kindness and mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
3  just as i encouraged you to stay in ephʹesus when i was about to go to macedoʹnia so i do now in order for you to command certain ones not to teach different doctrine
4  nor to pay attention to false stories and to genealogies
such things end up in nothing useful but merely give rise to speculations rather than providing anything from god in connection with faith
5  really the objective of this instruction is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy
6  by deviating from these things some have been turned aside to meaningless talk
7  they want to be teachers of law but they do not understand either the things they are saying or the things they insist on so strongly
8  now we know that the law is fine if one applies it properly
9  recognizing that law is made not for a righteous man but for those who are lawless and rebellious ungodly and sinners disloyal and profane murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers manslayers
10  sexually immoral people men who practice homosexuality kidnappers liars perjurers and everything else that is in opposition to the wholesome teaching
11  according to the glorious good news of the happy god with which i was entrusted
12  i am grateful to christ jesus our lord who imparted power to me because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry
13  although formerly i was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man
nevertheless i was shown mercy because i acted in ignorance and with a lack of faith
14  but the undeserved kindness of our lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and the love that is in christ jesus
15  this saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance christ jesus came into the world to save sinners
of these i am foremost
16  nevertheless i was shown mercy so that by means of me as the foremost case christ jesus might demonstrate all his patience making me an example to those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life
17  now to the king of eternity incorruptible invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever
amen
18  this instruction i entrust to you my child timothy in harmony with the prophecies that were made about you that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare
19  holding faith and a good conscience which some have thrust aside resulting in the shipwreck of their faith
20  hymenaeʹus and alexander are among these and i have handed them over to satan so that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme
2  first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgiving be made concerning all sorts of men
2  concerning kings and all those who are in high positions so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion and seriousness
3  this is fine and acceptable in the sight of our savior god
4  whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth
5  for there is one god and one mediator between god and men a man christ jesus
6  who gave himself a corresponding ransom for allthis is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time
7  for the purpose of this witness i was appointed a preacher and an apostlei am telling the truth i am not lyinga teacher of nations in the matter of faith and truth
8  so i desire that in every place the men carry on prayer lifting up loyal hands without anger and debates
9  likewise the women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress with modesty and soundness of mind not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing
10  but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to god namely through good works
11  let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness
12  i do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man but she is to remain silent
13  for adam was formed first then eve
14  also adam was not deceived but the woman was thoroughly deceived and became a transgressor
15  however she will be kept safe through childbearing provided she continues in faith and love and holiness along with soundness of mind
3  this statement is trustworthy if a man is reaching out to be an overseer he is desirous of a fine work
2  the overseer should therefore be irreprehensible a husband of one wife moderate in habits sound in mind orderly hospitable qualified to teach
3  not a drunkard not violent but reasonable not quarrelsome not a lover of money
4  a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner having his children in subjection with all seriousness
5  for if any man does not know how to preside over his own household how will he care for the congregation of god
6  not a newly converted man for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed on the devil
7  moreover he should also have a fine testimony from outsiders so that he does not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil
8  ministerial servants should likewise be serious not doubletongued not indulging in a lot of wine not greedy of dishonest gain
9  holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience
10  also let these be tested as to fitness first then let them serve as ministers as they are free from accusation
11  women should likewise be serious not slanderous moderate in habits faithful in all things
12  let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife presiding in a fine manner over their children and their own households
13  for the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith that is in christ jesus
14  i am writing you these things though i am hoping to come to you shortly
15  but in case i am delayed so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in gods household which is the congregation of the living god a pillar and support of the truth
16  indeed the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great he was made manifest in flesh was declared righteous in spirit appeared to angels was preached about among nations was believed upon in the world was received up in glory
