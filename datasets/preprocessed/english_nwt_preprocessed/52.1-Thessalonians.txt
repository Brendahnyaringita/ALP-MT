4  finally brothers just as you received instruction from us on how you should walk in order to please god just as you are in fact walking we request you and appeal to you by the lord jesus to keep doing it more fully
2  for you know the instructions we gave you through the lord jesus
3  for this is the will of god that you should be holy and abstain from sexual immorality
4  each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor
5  not with greedy uncontrolled sexual passion like the nations have that do not know god
6  no one should go beyond proper limits and take advantage of his brother in this matter because jehovah exacts punishment for all these things just as we told you previously and also strongly warned you
7  for god has called us not for uncleanness but for holiness
8  so then the man who disregards this is disregarding not man but god who gives you his holy spirit
9  however concerning brotherly love you do not need us to write to you for you yourselves are taught by god to love one another
10  in fact you are doing so toward all the brothers in all of macedoʹnia
but we urge you brothers to go on doing so in fuller measure
11  make it your aim to live quietly and to mind your own business and to work with your hands just as we instructed you
12  so that you may walk decently in the eyes of people outside and not need anything
13  moreover brothers we do not want you to be ignorant about those who are sleeping in death so that you may not sorrow as the rest do who have no hope
14  for if we have faith that jesus died and rose again so too god will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in death through jesus
15  for this is what we tell you by jehovahs word that we the living who survive to the presence of the lord will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death
16  because the lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call with an archangels voice and with gods trumpet and those who are dead in union with christ will rise first
17  afterward we the living who are surviving will together with them be caught away in clouds to meet the lord in the air and thus we will always be with the lord
18  so keep comforting one another with these words
5  now as for the times and the seasons brothers you need nothing to be written to you
2  for you yourselves know very well that jehovahs day is coming exactly as a thief in the night
3  whenever it is that they are saying peace and security then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them just like birth pains on a pregnant woman and they will by no means escape
4  but you brothers you are not in darkness so that the day should overtake you as it would thieves
5  for you are all sons of light and sons of day
we belong neither to night nor to darkness
6  so then let us not sleep on as the rest do but let us stay awake and keep our senses
7  for those who sleep sleep at night and those who get drunk are drunk at night
8  but as for us who belong to the day let us keep our senses and put on the breastplate of faith and love and the hope of salvation as a helmet
9  because god assigned us not to wrath but to the acquiring of salvation through our lord jesus christ
10  he died for us so that whether we stay awake or are asleep we should live together with him
11  therefore keep encouraging one another and building one another up just as you are in fact doing
12  now we request you brothers to show respect for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the lord and admonishing you
13  and to give them extraordinary consideration in love because of their work
be peaceable with one another
14  on the other hand we urge you brothers to warn the disorderly speak consolingly to those who are depressed support the weak be patient toward all
15  see that no one repays injury for injury to anyone but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others
16  always be rejoicing
17  pray constantly
18  give thanks for everything
this is gods will for you in christ jesus
19  do not put out the fire of the spirit
20  do not treat prophecies with contempt
21  make sure of all things hold fast to what is fine
22  abstain from every form of wickedness
23  may the god of peace himself sanctify you completely
and may the spirit and soul and body of you brothers sound in every respect be preserved blameless at the presence of our lord jesus christ
24  the one who is calling you is faithful and he will surely do so
25  brothers keep praying for us
26  greet all the brothers with a holy kiss
27  i am putting you under the solemn obligation by the lord to have this letter read to all the brothers
28  the undeserved kindness of our lord jesus christ be with you
1  paul silvaʹnus and timothy to the congregation of the thessaloʹnians in union with god the father and the lord jesus christ may you have undeserved kindness and peace
2  we always thank god when we mention all of you in our prayers
3  for we continually remember your faithful work your loving labor and your endurance because of your hope in our lord jesus christ in the presence of our god and father
4  for we know brothers loved by god his choosing of you
5  because the good news we preach did not come to you with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and with strong conviction just as you know what sort of men we became among you for your sakes
6  and you became imitators of us and of the lord seeing that you accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of holy spirit
7  so that you became an example to all the believers in macedoʹnia and in achaʹia
8  the fact is not only has the word of jehovah sounded out from you in macedoʹnia and achaʹia but your faith in god has spread abroad in every place so that we do not need to say anything
9  for they themselves keep reporting about our first contact with you and how you turned to god from your idols to slave for a living and true god
10  and to wait for his son from the heavens whom he raised up from the dead namely jesus who rescues us from the wrath that is coming
2  you yourselves surely know brothers that our visit to you has not been without results
2  for although we had first suffered and been insolently treated in philipʹpi as you know we mustered up boldness by means of our god to tell you the good news of god in the face of much opposition
3  for the exhortation we give does not spring from error or from uncleanness or with deceit
4  but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the good news so we speak to please not men but god who examines our hearts
5  in fact you know that we never used flattering speech or put on any false front with greedy motives god is witness
6  nor have we been seeking glory from men either from you or from others though we could be an expensive burden as apostles of christ
7  on the contrary we became gentle in your midst as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children
8  so having tender affection for you we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of god but also our very selves because you became so beloved to us
9  surely you remember brothers our labor and toil
we were working night and day so that we would not put an expensive burden on any one of you when we preached the good news of god to you
10  you are witnesses god is also of how loyal and righteous and blameless we behaved toward you believers
11  you well know that we kept exhorting and consoling you and bearing witness to each one of you just as a father does his children
12  so that you would go on walking worthily of god who is calling you to his kingdom and glory
13  indeed that is why we also thank god unceasingly because when you received gods word which you heard from us you accepted it not as the word of men but just as it truthfully is as the word of god which is also at work in you believers
14  for you brothers became imitators of the congregations of god in union with christ jesus that are in judeʹa because you suffered at the hands of your own countrymen the same things that they also are suffering at the hands of the jews
15  who even killed the lord jesus and the prophets and persecuted us
furthermore they are not pleasing god but are against the interests of all men
16  as they try to prevent us from speaking to people of the nations so that these might be saved
in this way they always fill up the measure of their sins
but his wrath has at last come upon them
17  but when we were separated from you brothers for just a short time in person not in our hearts because of our strong desire we made every effort to see you in person
18  for this reason we wanted to come to you yes i paul tried not just once but twice yet satan cut across our path
19  for what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation before our lord jesus at his presence is it not in fact you
20  you certainly are our glory and joy
3  so when we could bear it no longer we thought it best to stay on alone in athens
2  and we sent timothy our brother and gods minister in the good news about the christ to make you firm and comfort you regarding your faith
3  so that no one might be shaken by these tribulations
for you yourselves know that we cannot avoid suffering such things
4  for when we were with you we used to tell you in advance that we would suffer tribulation and that is what has happened just as you know
5  that is why when i could bear it no longer i sent to learn of your faithfulness in case somehow the tempter might have tempted you and our labor might have turned out to be in vain
6  but timothy has just now come to us from you and has given us the good news about your faithfulness and love that you always continue to remember us fondly and that you long to see us in the same way as we also do you
7  that is why brothers in all our distress and tribulation we have been comforted because of you and the faithfulness you demonstrate
8  because we are revitalized if you are standing firm in the lord
9  for how can we show our thanks to god concerning you in return for the great joy we feel before our god on your account
10  night and day we make supplications as earnestly as we can to see you in person and to supply what is lacking in your faith
11  now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus make a way for us to come to you
12  moreover may the lord cause you to increase yes to abound in love for one another and for all just as we do for you
13  so that he may make your hearts firm blameless in holiness before our god and father at the presence of our lord jesus with all his holy ones
