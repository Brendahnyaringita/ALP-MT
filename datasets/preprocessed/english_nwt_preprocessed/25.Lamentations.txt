4  how the shining gold has grown dim the fine gold how the holy stones lie scattered at every street corner
2  as for the precious sons of zion who were weighed against refined goldhow they have been regarded as earthenware jarsthe work of a potters hands
3  even jackals offer the udder to nurse their youngbut the daughter of my people has become cruel like ostriches in the wilderness
4  the tongue of the nursing infant sticks to its palate because of thirst
children beg for bread but no one gives them any
5  those who used to eat delicacies lie famished in the streets
those who were brought up wearing scarlet have embraced ash heaps
6  the punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment for the sin of sodʹomwhich was overthrown in a moment with no hand to help her
7  her nazʹirites were purer than snow whiter than milk
they were more ruddy than corals they were like polished sapphires
8  their appearance has become darker than sootthey are not recognized in the streets
their skin has shriveled over their bones it has become like dry wood
9  those slain with the sword are better off than those slain by faminethose who waste away who are pierced through for lack of food from the field
10  the hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children
they have become their food of mourning during the breakdown of the daughter of my people
11  jehovah has expressed his wrathhe has poured out his burning anger
and he starts a fire in zion that consumes her foundations
12  the kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the productive land did not believethat the adversary and the enemy would enter the gates of jerusalem
13  it was because of the sins of her prophets the errors of her priestswho shed the blood of righteous ones in her midst
14  they have wandered blindly in the streets
they are polluted with bloodso that none are able to touch their garments
15  go away unclean they call out to them
go away go away do not touch us for they have gone homeless and wander about
people have said among the nations they cannot stay here with us
16  the face of jehovah has scattered themhe will no longer look favorably on them
men will show no respect for the priests no favor to the elders
17  even now our eyes are worn out from looking in vain for help
we looked and looked for help from a nation that could not save us
18  they have hunted us down at every step so that we could not walk in our public squares
our end has drawn near our days have finished for our end has come
19  our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky
they chased us on the mountains they ambushed us in the wilderness
20  the breath of our nostrils the anointed one of jehovah has been captured in their large pitthe one of whom we said in his shade we will live among the nations
21  exult and rejoice o daughter of eʹdom living as you do in the land of uz
but to you also the cup will be passed and you will become drunk and expose your nakedness
22  the punishment for your error o daughter of zion has come to its finish
he will not carry you off into exile again
but he will turn his attention to your error o daughter of eʹdom
he will uncover your sins
5  remember o jehovah what has befallen us
look and see our disgrace
2  our inheritance has been turned over to strangers our houses to foreigners
3  we have become orphans without a father our mothers are like widows
4  we must pay to drink our own water and our own wood comes at a price
5  those pursuing us are at our neckwe are weary but we are given no rest
6  we hold out our hand to egypt and to assyrʹia to get enough bread to eat
7  our forefathers who sinned are no more but we must bear their errors
8  servants now rule over us there is no one to snatch us from their hand
9  we bring in our bread at the risk of our life because of the sword of the wilderness
10  our skin has become as hot as a furnace because of the pangs of hunger
11  the wives in zion they have humiliated the virgins in the cities of judah
12  princes were hanged by their hand and elders were shown no respect
13  young men carry the hand mill and boys stumble under loads of wood
14  the elders are gone from the city gate young men do not play their music
15  the joy is gone from our heart our dancing has turned into mourning
16  the crown has fallen from our head
woe to us because we have sinned
17  because of this our heart is sickand because of these things our eyes have grown dim
18  because of mount zion which is desolate foxes now roam on it
19  as for you o jehovah you sit enthroned forever
your throne is for generation after generation
20  why do you forget us forever and abandon us for so long a time
21  bring us back to yourself o jehovah and we will readily return to you
renew our days as in those of old
22  however you have utterly rejected us
you remain intensely angry with us
1  how she now sits all alone the city that was full of people how she has become like a widow she who was populous among the nations how she who was a princess among the provinces has been put to forced labor
2  she weeps profusely during the night and her tears cover her cheeks
not one of all her lovers is there to comfort her
all her own companions have betrayed her they have become her enemies
3  judah has gone into exile under affliction and harsh slavery
she must dwell among the nations she finds no restingplace
all her persecutors have overtaken her in her distress
4  the roads to zion are mourning because no one is coming to the festival
all her gates are desolate her priests are sighing
her virgins are grieving and she is in bitter anguish
5  her adversaries are now her master her enemies are carefree
for jehovah has brought grief to her because of her many transgressions
her children have gone into captivity before the adversary
6  all the splendor has departed from the daughter of zion
her princes are like stags that have found no pastureand they walk exhausted before the pursuer
7  in the days of her affliction and her homelessness jerusalem remembersall the precious things that were hers in the days of long ago
when her people fell into the hand of the adversary and she had no helperthe adversaries saw her and laughed over her collapse
8  jerusalem has sinned greatly
that is why she has become something abhorrent
all who used to honor her now treat her as something contemptible for they have seen her nakedness
she herself groans and turns away in shame
9  her uncleanness is in her skirts
she gave no thought to her future
her downfall was astounding she has no one to comfort her
o jehovah see my affliction for the enemy has magnified himself
10  the adversary has laid his hands on all her treasures
for she has seen nations enter her sanctuarythose whom you commanded should not enter into your congregation
11  all her people are sighing they are looking for bread
they have given their valuable things for something to eat just to stay alive
look o jehovah and see that i have become as a worthless woman
12  is it nothing to all of you who pass along the road look and see is there any pain like the pain that was dealt out to mewhich jehovah made me suffer in the day of his burning anger
13  from on high he has sent fire into my bones and he subdues each one
he has spread out a net for my feet he has forced me to turn backward
he has made me a desolate woman
all day long i am ill
14  my transgressions are bound as a yoke fastened together by his hand
they have been placed on my neck and my strength has failed
jehovah has given me into the hand of those whom i cannot resist
15  jehovah has tossed aside all the powerful men in my midst
he has summoned an assembly against me to crush my young men
jehovah has trodden the virgin daughter of judah in the winepress
16  i am weeping because of these things my eyes flow with tears
for anyone who could comfort me or refresh me is far away from me
my sons are desolate for the enemy has prevailed
17  zion has spread out her hands she has no one to comfort her
jehovah has given an order against jacob to all his adversaries around him
jerusalem has become to them an abhorrent thing
18  jehovah is righteous for it is against his commands that i have rebelled
listen all you peoples and see my pain
my virgins and my young men have gone into captivity
19  i have called out to my lovers but they have betrayed me
in the city my priests and my elders have perishedwhile they searched for food in order to stay alive
20  see o jehovah for i am in great distress
my insides are churning
my heart has turned over within me for i have been completely rebellious
outside the sword bereaves inside the house it is like death
21  people have heard my sighing there is no one to comfort me
all my enemies have heard of my calamity
they are joyful because you brought it about
but you will bring about the day that you proclaimed when they will become like me
22  may all their badness come before you and may you deal harshly with themjust as you have dealt harshly with me because of all my transgressions
for my sighs are many and my heart is sick
2  how jehovah has covered the daughter of zion in the cloud of his anger he has thrown down the beauty of israel from heaven to earth
he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger
2  jehovah has swallowed up without compassion all the dwellings of jacob
in his fury he has torn down the fortified places of the daughter of judah
he has brought down to the ground and profaned the kingdom and her princes
3  in the heat of anger he has cut down all the strength of israel
he withdrew his right hand when the enemy approachedand in jacob he kept burning like a fire that consumed everything around it
4  he has bent his bow like an enemy his right hand is poised as an adversaryhe kept killing all those desirable to the eyes
and he poured out his wrath like a fire into the tent of the daughter of zion
5  jehovah has become like an enemyhe has swallowed down israel
he has swallowed down all her towershe has destroyed all its fortified places
and in the daughter of judah he makes mourning and lamentation abound
6  he treats his booth violently like a hut in a garden
he has put an end to his festival
jehovah has caused festival and sabbath to be forgotten in zionand in his fierce indignation he shows no regard for king and priest
7  jehovah has rejected his altarhe has spurned his sanctuary
he has surrendered the walls of her fortified towers into the hand of the enemy
they have raised their voice in the house of jehovah as on the day of a festival
8  jehovah has resolved to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion
he has stretched out the measuring line
he has not held back his hand from bringing destruction
and he causes rampart and wall to mourn
together they have been made weak
9  her gates have sunk down into the earth
he has destroyed and broken her bars
her king and her princes are among the nations
there is no law even her prophets find no vision from jehovah
10  the elders of the daughter of zion sit on the ground in silence
they throw dust on their heads and wear sackcloth
the virgins of jerusalem have bowed their heads down to the ground
11  my eyes are worn out from shedding tears
my insides are churning
my liver has been poured out on the ground because of the downfall of the daughter of my peoplebecause of the children and infants fainting away in the public squares of the town
12  they keep asking their mothers where are grain and wine as they faint away like someone wounded in the public squares of the cityas their life ebbs away in their mothers arms
13  what can i use as a witnessor to what can i liken you o daughter of jerusalem to what can i compare you to comfort you o virgin daughter of zion for your breakdown is as vast as the sea
who can heal you
14  the visions your prophets saw for you were false and emptyand they did not expose your error in order to turn away your captivitybut they kept visioning for you false and misleading pronouncements
15  at you all those passing by on the road scornfully clap their hands
they whistle in amazement and shake their heads at the daughter of jerusalem saying is this the city about which they said it is perfect in beauty the joy of all the earth
16  at you all your enemies have opened their mouth
they whistle and grind their teeth and say we have swallowed her down
this is the day we were waiting for it has arrived and we have seen it
17  jehovah has done what he intended he has carried out his sayingwhat he commanded long ago
he has torn down without compassion
he has let the enemy rejoice over you he has exalted the strength of your adversaries
18  their heart cries out to jehovah o wall of the daughter of zion
let tears stream down like a torrent day and night
give yourself no respite give your eye no rest
19  rise up cry out during the night at the start of the watches
pour out your heart like water before the face of jehovah
raise your hands to him for the lives of your childrenwho are fainting away at every street corner because of famine
20  see o jehovah and look upon the one with whom you have dealt so harshly
should women keep eating their own offspring their own fully formed childrenor should priests and prophets be killed in the sanctuary of jehovah
21  young boy and old man are lying dead on the ground in the streets
my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword
you have killed in the day of your anger you have slaughtered without compassion
22  as if for a festival day you summon terrors from every direction
in the day of the wrath of jehovah no one escaped or survivedthose whom i gave birth to and reared my enemy exterminated
3  i am the man who has seen affliction because of the rod of his fury
2  he has driven me out and makes me walk in darkness not in light
3  indeed he repeatedly brings his hand against me all day long
4  he has worn away my flesh and my skinhe has broken my bones
5  he has besieged me he has surrounded me with bitter poison and hardship
6  he has forced me to sit in dark places like men who died long ago
7  he has walled me in so that i cannot escapehe has bound me with heavy copper fetters
8  and when i cry out desperately for help he rejects my prayer
9  he has blocked up my paths with hewn stoneshe has made my roadways crooked
10  he waits to ambush me like a bear like a lion in hiding
11  he has forced me off the paths and torn me to pieceshe has made me desolate
12  he has bent his bow and he sets me up as the target for the arrow
13  he has pierced my kidneys with the arrows of his quiver
14  i have become a laughingstock to all the peoples the theme of their song all day long
15  he has filled me with bitter things and saturated me with wormwood
16  he breaks my teeth with gravelhe makes me cower in the ashes
17  you deprive me of peace i have forgotten what is good
18  so i say my splendor has perished as well as my expectation in jehovah
19  remember my affliction and my homeless state the wormwood and the bitter poison
20  you will surely remember and bow low over me
21  i recall this in my heart that is why i will show a waiting attitude
22  it is because of jehovahs loyal love that we have not come to our finishfor his mercies never end
23  they are new each morning your faithfulness is abundant
24  jehovah is my share i have said that is why i will show a waiting attitude for him
25  good is jehovah to the one hoping in him to the person who keeps seeking him
26  good it is to wait in silence for the salvation of jehovah
27  good it is for a man to carry the yoke during his youth
28  let him sit alone and keep silent when he lays it upon him
29  let him put his mouth in the very dust there may yet be hope
30  let him give his cheek to the one striking him let him have his fill of insults
31  for jehovah will not cast us off forever
32  although he has caused grief he will also show mercy according to his abundant loyal love
33  for it is not in his heart to afflict or grieve the sons of men
34  to crush beneath ones feet all the prisoners of the earth
35  to deprive a man of justice in the presence of the most high
36  to defraud a man in his legal casejehovah does not tolerate such things
37  who then can speak and have it happen unless jehovah commands it
38  from the mouth of the most highbad things and good things do not go out together
39  why should a living person complain about the consequences of his sin
40  let us examine and scrutinize our ways and let us return to jehovah
41  let us lift up our hearts along with our hands to god in the heavens
42  we have transgressed and rebelled and you have not forgiven
43  with anger you have blocked our approachyou have pursued and killed us without compassion
44  you have blocked approach to yourself with a cloud so that our prayer may not pass through
45  you make us offscouring and refuse among the peoples
46  all our enemies open their mouths against us
47  dread and pitfalls have become our lot desolation and breakdown
48  streams of water flow from my eyes over the breakdown of the daughter of my people
49  my eyes weep without ceasing without pausing
50  until jehovah looks down and sees from heaven
51  my eyes have brought me grief because of all the daughters of my city
52  without cause my enemies have hunted me down like a bird
53  they have silenced my life in the pit they kept hurling stones at me
54  waters flowed over my head and i said i am finished
55  i called out your name o jehovah from the depths of the pit
56  hear my voice do not shut your ear to my cry for help for relief
57  you drew near in the day that i called you
you said do not be afraid
58  you have defended my cause o jehovah you have redeemed my life
59  you have seen o jehovah the wrong done to me please grant me justice
60  you have seen all their vengeance all their schemes against me
61  you have heard their taunts o jehovah all their schemes against me
62  the lips of my opposers and their whispering against me all day long
63  look at them whether they sit or stand they mock me in their songs
64  you will repay them o jehovah according to their deeds
65  you will make them hardhearted as your curse to them
66  you will pursue them in your anger and annihilate them from under the heavens of jehovah
