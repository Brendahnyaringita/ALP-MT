10  this is the history of noahs sons shem ham and jaʹpheth
sons were born to them after the flood
2  the sons of jaʹpheth were goʹmer maʹgog maʹdai jaʹvan tuʹbal meʹshech and tiʹras
3  the sons of goʹmer were ashʹkenaz riʹphath and togarʹmah
4  the sons of jaʹvan were eliʹshah tarʹshish kitʹtim and doʹdanim
5  from these the inhabitants of the islands spread into their lands according to their languages and their families and by their nations
6  the sons of ham were cush mizʹraim put and caʹnaan
7  the sons of cush were seʹba havʹilah sabʹtah raʹamah and sabʹteca
the sons of raʹamah were sheʹba and deʹdan
8  cush became father to nimʹrod
he was the first to become a mighty one on the earth
9  he became a mighty hunter in opposition to jehovah
that is why there is a saying just like nimʹrod a mighty hunter in opposition to jehovah
10  the beginning of his kingdom was baʹbel eʹrech acʹcad and calʹneh in the land of shiʹnar
11  from that land he went into assyrʹia and built ninʹeveh rehoʹbothir caʹlah
12  and reʹsen between ninʹeveh and caʹlah this is the great city
13  mizʹraim became father to luʹdim anʹamim lehaʹbim naphtuʹhim
14  pathruʹsim casluʹhim from whom the philisʹtines came and caphʹtorim
15  caʹnaan became father to siʹdon his firstborn and heth
16  as well as the jebʹusite the amʹorite the girʹgashite
17  the hiʹvite the arkʹite the siʹnite
18  the arʹvadite the zemʹarite and the haʹmathite
afterward the families of the caʹnaanites were scattered
19  so the boundary of the caʹnaanites was from siʹdon as far as geʹrar near gazʹa as far as sodʹom gomorʹrah adʹmah and zeboiʹim near laʹsha
20  these were the sons of ham according to their families and their languages by their lands and their nations
21  children were also born to shem the forefather of all the sons of eʹber and the brother of jaʹpheth the oldest
22  the sons of shem were eʹlam asʹshur arpachʹshad lud and aʹram
23  the sons of aʹram were uz hul geʹther and mash
24  arpachʹshad became father to sheʹlah and sheʹlah became father to eʹber
25  two sons were born to eʹber
the name of the one was peʹleg because in his lifetime the earth was divided
the name of his brother was jokʹtan
26  jokʹtan became father to almoʹdad sheʹleph hazarmaʹveth jeʹrah
27  hadoʹram uʹzal dikʹlah
28  oʹbal abimʹael sheʹba
29  oʹphir havʹilah and joʹbab all of these were the sons of jokʹtan
30  their place of dwelling extended from meʹsha as far as seʹphar the mountainous region of the east
31  these were the sons of shem according to their families and their languages by their lands and their nations
32  these were the families of the sons of noah according to their family lines and by their nations
from these the nations were spread abroad in the earth after the flood
4  now adam had sexual relations with his wife eve and she became pregnant
when she gave birth to cain she said i have produced a male child with the help of jehovah
2  later she again gave birth to his brother abel
abel became a shepherd of the flock but cain became a cultivator of the ground
3  after some time cain brought some fruits of the land as an offering to jehovah
4  but abel brought some firstlings of his flock including their fat
while jehovah looked with favor on abel and on his offering
5  he did not look with any favor on cain and on his offering
so cain grew hot with anger and was dejected
6  then jehovah said to cain why are you so angry and dejected
7  if you turn to doing good will you not be restored to favor but if you do not turn to doing good sin is crouching at the door and its craving is to dominate you but will you get the mastery over it
8  after that cain said to his brother abel let us go over into the field
so while they were in the field cain assaulted his brother abel and killed him
9  later on jehovah said to cain where is your brother abel and he said i do not know
am i my brothers guardian
10  at this he said what have you done listen your brothers blood is crying out to me from the ground
11  and now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand
12  when you cultivate the ground it will not give you back its produce
you will become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth
13  at this cain said to jehovah the punishment for my error is too great to bear
14  today you are driving me from the land and i will be hidden from your face and i will become a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth and anyone who finds me will certainly kill me
15  so jehovah said to him for that reason anyone who kills cain will suffer vengeance seven times
so jehovah set up a sign for cain in order that no one finding him would strike him
16  then cain went away from before jehovah and took up residence in the land of exile to the east of eʹden
17  afterward cain had sexual relations with his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to eʹnoch
then he engaged in building a city and named the city after his son eʹnoch
18  later iʹrad was born to eʹnoch
and iʹrad became father to mehuʹjael and mehuʹjael became father to methuʹshael and methuʹshael became father to laʹmech
19  laʹmech took two wives for himself
the name of the first was aʹdah and the name of the second was zilʹlah
20  aʹdah gave birth to jaʹbal
he was the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock
21  his brothers name was juʹbal
he was the founder of all those who play the harp and the pipe
22  also zilʹlah gave birth to tuʹbalcain who forged every sort of tool of copper and iron
and the sister of tuʹbalcain was naʹamah
23  then laʹmech composed these words for his wives aʹdah and zilʹlah hear my voice you wives of laʹmechgive ear to my saying a man i have killed for wounding meyes a young man for striking me
24  if 7 times cain is to be avengedthen laʹmech 77 times
25  adam again had sexual relations with his wife and she gave birth to a son
she named him seth because as she said god has appointed for me another offspring in place of abel because cain killed him
26  there was also born to seth a son and he named him eʹnosh
at that time people began calling on the name of jehovah
26  now there was a famine in the land in addition to the first famine that occurred in the days of abraham so that isaac went to abimʹelech king of the philisʹtines in geʹrar
2  then jehovah appeared to him and said do not go down to egypt
dwell in the land that i designate to you
3  reside as a foreigner in this land and i will continue with you and bless you because to you and to your offspring i will give all these lands and i will carry out the oath that i swore to your father abraham
4  i will multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens and i will give to your offspring all these lands and by means of your offspring all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves
5  on account of the fact that abraham listened to my voice and continued to keep my requirements my commands my statutes and my laws
6  so isaac continued to dwell in geʹrar
7  when the men of the place kept asking about his wife he would say she is my sister
he was afraid to say she is my wife for he said the men of the place might kill me because of rebekʹah for she was beautiful in appearance
8  after some time had passed abimʹelech king of the philisʹtines was looking out of the window and he saw isaac displaying affection for rebekʹah his wife
9  at once abimʹelech called isaac and said she is actually your wife why did you say she is my sister at this isaac said to him i said it for fear i should die because of her
10  but abimʹelech continued what have you done to us one of the people could easily have lain down with your wife and you would have brought guilt upon us
11  then abimʹelech commanded all the people saying anybody touching this man and his wife will surely be put to death
12  and isaac began to sow seed in that land and in that year he reaped 100 times what he sowed for jehovah was blessing him
13  the man became wealthy and he continued to prosper until he became very wealthy
14  he acquired flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and a large body of servants and the philisʹtines began to envy him
15  so the philisʹtines took soil and stopped up all the wells that his fathers servants had dug in the days of abraham
16  abimʹelech then said to isaac move from our neighborhood for you have grown far stronger than we are
17  so isaac moved from there and encamped in the valley of geʹrar and began dwelling there
18  and isaac again dug the wells that had been dug in the days of his father abraham but that the philisʹtines had stopped up after abrahams death and he called them by the names that his father had given them
19  when the servants of isaac were digging in the valley they found a well of fresh water
20  and the shepherds of geʹrar began quarreling with the shepherds of isaac saying the water is ours so he named the well eʹsek because they had quarreled with him
21  and they started digging another well and they began quarreling over it also
so he named it sitʹnah
22  later he moved away from there and dug another well but they did not quarrel over it
so he named it rehoʹboth and said it is because now jehovah has given us ample room and has made us fruitful in the land
23  then he went up from there to beʹersheʹba
24  that night jehovah appeared to him and said i am the god of your father abraham
do not be afraid for i am with you and i will bless you and multiply your offspring on account of abraham my servant
25  so he built an altar there and called on the name of jehovah
and isaac pitched his tent there and his servants dug a well there
26  later abimʹelech came to him from geʹrar with ahuzʹzath his personal adviser and phiʹcol the chief of his army
27  at this isaac said to them why have you come to me seeing that you hated me and sent me away from your neighborhood
28  to this they said we have clearly seen that jehovah has been with you
so we said let there please be an oath of obligation between us and you and let us make a covenant with you
29  that you will do nothing bad to us just as we have not harmed you seeing that we have done only good to you in that we sent you away in peace
you now are the blessed of jehovah
30  then he made a feast for them and they ate and drank
31  in the morning they got up early and swore an oath to each other
after that isaac sent them away and they went from him in peace
32  on that day the servants of isaac came and reported to him about the well that they had dug and they told him we have found water
33  so he named it shiʹbah
that is why the name of the city is beʹersheʹba to this day
34  when eʹsau was 40 years old he took as wife juʹdith the daughter of beeʹri the hitʹtite and also basʹemath the daughter of eʹlon the hitʹtite
35  they were a source of great grief to isaac and rebekʹah
11  now all the earth continued to be of one language and of one set of words
2  as they traveled eastward they discovered a valley plain in the land of shiʹnar and they began dwelling there
3  then they said to one another come let us make bricks and bake them with fire
so they used bricks instead of stone and bitumen as mortar
4  they now said come let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves so that we will not be scattered over the entire face of the earth
5  then jehovah went down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built
6  jehovah then said look they are one people with one language and this is what they have started to do
now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be impossible for them
7  come let us go down there and confuse their language in order that they may not understand one anothers language
8  so jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face of the earth and they gradually left off building the city
9  that is why it was named baʹbel because there jehovah confused the language of all the earth and jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face of the earth
10  this is the history of shem
shem was 100 years old when he became father to arpachʹshad two years after the flood
11  after becoming father to arpachʹshad shem continued to live 500 years
and he became father to sons and daughters
12  arpachʹshad lived for 35 years and then became father to sheʹlah
13  after becoming father to sheʹlah arpachʹshad continued to live 403 years
and he became father to sons and daughters
14  sheʹlah lived for 30 years and then became father to eʹber
15  after becoming father to eʹber sheʹlah continued to live 403 years
and he became father to sons and daughters
16  eʹber lived for 34 years and then became father to peʹleg
17  after becoming father to peʹleg eʹber continued to live 430 years
and he became father to sons and daughters
18  peʹleg lived for 30 years and then became father to reʹu
19  after becoming father to reʹu peʹleg continued to live 209 years
and he became father to sons and daughters
20  reʹu lived for 32 years and then became father to seʹrug
21  after becoming father to seʹrug reʹu continued to live 207 years
and he became father to sons and daughters
22  seʹrug lived for 30 years and then became father to naʹhor
23  after becoming father to naʹhor seʹrug continued to live 200 years
and he became father to sons and daughters
24  naʹhor lived for 29 years and then became father to teʹrah
25  after becoming father to teʹrah naʹhor continued to live 119 years
and he became father to sons and daughters
26  teʹrah lived for 70 years after which he became father to aʹbram naʹhor and haʹran
27  this is the history of teʹrah
teʹrah became father to aʹbram naʹhor and haʹran and haʹran became father to lot
28  while his father teʹrah was still alive haʹran died in the land of his birth in ur of the chaldeʹans
29  aʹbram and naʹhor took wives for themselves
the name of aʹbrams wife was sarʹai and the name of naʹhors wife was milʹcah the daughter of haʹran the father of milʹcah and isʹcah
30  now sarʹai was barren she had no child
31  teʹrah then took aʹbram his son and lot his grandson the son of haʹran and sarʹai his daughterinlaw the wife of aʹbram his son and they went with him out of ur of the chaldeʹans to go to the land of caʹnaan
in time they came to haʹran and began dwelling there
32  the days of teʹrah were 205 years
then teʹrah died in haʹran
49  and jacob called his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you what will happen to you in the final part of the days
2  assemble yourselves and listen you sons of jacob yes listen to israel your father
3  reuʹben you are my firstborn my vigor and the beginning of my procreative power the excellence of dignity and the excellence of strength
4  with recklessness like turbulent waters you will not excel because you have gone up to your fathers bed
at that time you defiled my bed
he actually went on to it
5  simʹeon and leʹvi are brothers
instruments of violence are their slaughter weapons
6  into their company do not come o my soul
with their assembly do not join o my honor because in their anger they killed men and for their pleasure they hamstrung bulls
7  cursed be their anger because it is cruel and their fury because it is harsh
let me disperse them in jacob and let me scatter them in israel
8  as for you judah your brothers will praise you
your hand will be on the neck of your enemies
the sons of your father will bow down before you
9  judah is a lion cub
from the prey my son you will certainly go up
he has crouched down and stretched himself out like a lion and like a lion who dares rouse him
10  the scepter will not depart from judah neither the commanders staff from between his feet until shiʹloh comes and to him the obedience of the peoples will belong
11  tying his donkey to a vine and his donkeys colt to a choice vine he will wash his clothing in wine and his garment in the blood of grapes
12  dark red are his eyes from wine and his teeth are white from milk
13  zebʹulun will reside by the seashore by the shore where the ships lie anchored and his remote border will be toward siʹdon
14  isʹsachar is a strongboned donkey lying down between the two saddlebags
15  and he will see that the restingplace is good and that the land is pleasant
he will bend his shoulder to bear the burden and will submit to forced labor
16  dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of israel
17  let dan be a serpent by the roadside a horned snake beside the path that bites the heels of the horse so that its rider falls backward
18  i will wait for salvation from you o jehovah
19  as for gad a marauder band will raid him but he will raid at their heels
20  ashʹers bread will be abundant and he will provide food fit for a king
21  naphʹtali is a slender doe
he is speaking words of elegance
22  joseph is the offshoot of a fruitful tree a fruitful tree by a spring whose branches extend over the wall
23  but the archers kept harassing him and shot at him and kept harboring animosity against him
24  and yet his bow remained in place and his hands stayed strong and agile
this was from the hands of the powerful one of jacob from the shepherd the stone of israel
25  he is from the god of your father and he will help you and he is with the almighty and he will bless you with the blessings of the heavens above with the blessings of the deep below with the blessings of the breasts and womb
26  the blessings of your father will be superior to the blessings of the eternal mountains to the desirable things of the enduring hills
they will continue upon the head of joseph upon the crown of the head of the one singled out from his brothers
27  benjamin will keep on tearing like a wolf
in the morning he will eat the prey and in the evening he will divide spoil
28  all of these are the 12 tribes of israel and this is what their father said to them when he was blessing them
he gave each of them an appropriate blessing
29  after that he gave these commands to them i am being gathered to my people
bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of eʹphron the hitʹtite
30  the cave in the field of machpeʹlah in front of mamʹre in the land of caʹnaan the field that abraham purchased from eʹphron the hitʹtite as a property for a burial place
31  there they buried abraham and his wife sarah
there they buried isaac and his wife rebekʹah and there i buried leʹah
32  the field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the sons of heth
33  thus jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons
then he drew his feet up onto the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people
8  but god gave attention to noah and to all the wild animals and domestic animals that were with him in the ark and god caused a wind to blow over the earth and the waters began to subside
2  the springs of the watery deep and the floodgates of the heavens were stopped up so the rain from the heavens stopped falling
3  then the waters began to recede progressively from the earth
by the end of 150 days the waters had subsided
4  in the seventh month on the 17th day of the month the ark came to rest on the mountains of arʹarat
5  and the waters were steadily decreasing until the tenth month
in the tenth month on the first of the month the tops of the mountains appeared
6  so at the end of 40 days noah opened the window that he had made in the ark
7  and sent out a raven it continued flying outside and returning until the waters dried off the earth
8  later he sent out a dove to see whether the waters had receded from the surface of the ground
9  the dove did not find any restingplace to perch so it returned to him into the ark because the waters were still covering the surface of the whole earth
so he reached his hand out and brought it inside the ark
10  he waited seven more days and once again he sent out the dove from the ark
11  when the dove came to him toward evening he saw that there was a freshly plucked olive leaf in its bill so noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth
12  he waited still another seven days
then he sent out the dove but it did not return to him anymore
13  now in the 601st year in the first month on the first day of the month the waters had drained from the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was drying
14  in the second month on the 27th day of the month the earth had dried off
15  god now said to noah
16  go out of the ark you your wife your sons and your sons wives
17  bring out with you all the living creatures of every sort of flesh of the flying creatures and of the animals and of all the creeping animals of the earth that they may multiply on the earth and be fruitful and become many on the earth
18  so noah went out together with his sons his wife and his sons wives
19  every living creature every creeping animal and every flying creature everything that moves on the earth went out of the ark by families
20  then noah built an altar to jehovah and took some of all the clean animals and of all the clean flying creatures and offered burnt offerings on the altar
21  and jehovah began to smell a pleasing aroma
so jehovah said in his heart never again will i curse the ground on mans account for the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up and never again will i strike down every living thing as i have done
22  from now on the earth will never cease to have seedsowing and harvest cold and heat summer and winter and day and night
30  when rachel saw that she had borne no children to jacob she became jealous of her sister and began to say to jacob give me children or else i will die
2  at this jacobs anger flared up against rachel and he said am i in the place of god who has prevented you from having children
3  so she said here is my slave girl bilʹhah
have relations with her in order that she may bear children for me and that through her i too may have children
4  with that she gave him her servant bilʹhah as a wife and jacob had relations with her
5  bilʹhah became pregnant and in time bore jacob a son
6  then rachel said god has acted as my judge and has also listened to my voice so that he gave me a son
that is why she named him dan
7  bilʹhah rachels servant became pregnant once more and in time bore jacob a second son
8  then rachel said with strenuous wrestlings i have wrestled with my sister
i have also come off the winner so she named him naphʹtali
9  when leʹah saw that she had stopped having children she took her servant zilʹpah and gave her to jacob as a wife
10  and leʹahs servant zilʹpah bore a son to jacob
11  then leʹah said with good fortune so she named him gad
12  after that zilʹpah leʹahs servant bore a second son to jacob
13  then leʹah said with my happiness for the daughters will certainly pronounce me happy
so she named him ashʹer
14  now reuʹben was walking in the days of the wheat harvest and he found mandrakes in the field
so he brought them to his mother leʹah
then rachel said to leʹah give me please some of your sons mandrakes
15  at this she said to her is it a small matter that you took my husband would you now take my sons mandrakes also so rachel said very well
he will lie down with you tonight in exchange for your sons mandrakes
16  when jacob was coming from the field in the evening leʹah went out to meet him and said it is with me you are going to have relations because i have hired you outright with my sons mandrakes
so he lay down with her that night
17  and god heard and answered leʹah and she became pregnant and in time bore to jacob a fifth son
18  then leʹah said god has given me my wages because i have given my servant to my husband
so she named him isʹsachar
19  and leʹah became pregnant once more and in time bore a sixth son to jacob
20  then leʹah said god has endowed me yes me with a good endowment
at last my husband will tolerate me for i have borne him six sons
so she named him zebʹulun
21  afterward she bore a daughter and named her diʹnah
22  finally god remembered rachel and god heard and answered her by enabling her to become pregnant
23  and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son
then she said god has taken away my reproach
24  so she named him joseph saying jehovah is adding another son to me
25  after rachel had given birth to joseph jacob immediately said to laʹban send me away so that i may go to my place and to my land
26  give over my wives and my children for whom i have served with you that i may go for you well know how i have served you
27  then laʹban said to him if i have found favor in your eyesi have understood by the omens that jehovah is blessing me because of you
28  and he added stipulate your wages to me and i will give them
29  so jacob said to him you know how i have served you and how your herd has fared with me
30  you had little before my coming but your herd has increased and multiplied and jehovah has blessed you since i arrived
so when will i do something for my own house
31  then he said what should i give you and jacob said you will give me nothing whatsoever if you will do this one thing for me i will resume shepherding your flock and guarding it
32  i will pass through your whole flock today
you set aside from there every sheep speckled and with color patches and every darkbrown sheep among the young rams and any colorpatched and speckled one among the shegoats
from now on these must become my wages
33  and my righteousness must speak for me on a future day when you come to look over my wages every one that is not speckled and colorpatched among the shegoats and dark brown among the young rams will be considered stolen if it is with me
34  to this laʹban said that is fine let it be according to your word
35  then on that day he set aside the hegoats striped and colorpatched and all the shegoats speckled and colorpatched every one in which there was any white and every one dark brown among the young rams and gave them into the care of his sons
36  after that he set a distance of three days journey between himself and jacob and jacob was shepherding the flocks of laʹban that remained over
37  jacob then took freshly cut staffs of the storax almond and plane trees and he peeled white spots in them by exposing the white wood of the staffs
38  then he placed the staffs that he had peeled in front of the flock in the gutters in the drinking troughs where the flocks would come to drink that they might get into heat in front of them when they came to drink
39  so the flocks would get into heat in front of the staffs and the flocks would produce striped speckled and colorpatched offspring
40  then jacob separated the young rams and turned the flocks to face the striped ones and all the darkbrown ones among the flocks of laʹban
then he separated his own flocks and did not mix them with laʹbans flocks
41  and whenever the robust animals would get into heat jacob would place the staffs in the gutters before the eyes of the flocks that they might get into heat by the staffs
42  but when the animals were weak he would not place the staffs there
so the weak ones always came to be laʹbans but the robust ones became jacobs
43  and the man grew very prosperous and he acquired great flocks and male and female servants and camels and donkeys
16  now aʹbrams wife sarʹai had borne him no children but she had an egyptian servant whose name was haʹgar
2  so sarʹai said to aʹbram please now jehovah has prevented me from bearing children
please have relations with my servant
perhaps i can have children by means of her
so aʹbram listened to what sarʹai said
3  after aʹbram had lived for ten years in the land of caʹnaan aʹbrams wife sarʹai took her egyptian servant haʹgar and gave her to her husband aʹbram as his wife
4  so he had relations with haʹgar and she became pregnant
when she realized that she was pregnant she began to despise her mistress
5  at this sarʹai said to aʹbram the injury done to me is your fault
i was the one who put my servant in your arms but when she realized that she was pregnant she began to despise me
may jehovah judge between me and you
6  so aʹbram said to sarʹai look your servant is under your authority
do to her whatever you think is best
then sarʹai humiliated her and she ran away from her
7  later jehovahs angel found her at a spring of waters in the wilderness the spring on the way to shur
8  and he said haʹgar servant of sarʹai where have you come from and where are you going to this she said i am running away from my mistress sarʹai
9  jehovahs angel then said to her return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand
10  then jehovahs angel said i will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count
11  jehovahs angel added here you are pregnant and you will give birth to a son and you must name him ishʹmael for jehovah has heard your affliction
12  he will be a wild donkey of a man
his hand will be against everyone and everyones hand will be against him and he will dwell opposite all his brothers
13  then she called on the name of jehovah who was speaking to her you are a god of sight for she said have i here actually looked upon the one who sees me
14  that is why the well was called beʹerlaʹhairoi
it is between kaʹdesh and beʹred
15  so haʹgar bore to aʹbram a son and aʹbram named his son whom haʹgar bore ishʹmael
16  aʹbram was 86 years old when haʹgar bore ishʹmael to him
35  after that god said to jacob rise go up to bethʹel and dwell there and make an altar there to the true god who appeared to you when you were running away from eʹsau your brother
2  then jacob said to his household and to all who were with him get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst and cleanse yourselves and change your garments
3  and let us rise and go up to bethʹel
there i will make an altar to the true god who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever i have gone
4  so they gave jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings that were in their ears and jacob buried them under the big tree that was close to sheʹchem
5  when they traveled on the terror of god struck the cities around them so they did not chase after the sons of jacob
6  jacob eventually came to luz that is bethʹel in the land of caʹnaan he and all the people with him
7  there he built an altar and called the place elbethʹel because there the true god had revealed himself to him when he had run away from his brother
8  later debʹorah rebekʹahs nurse died and was buried at the foot of bethʹel under an oak
so he named it alʹlonbacʹuth
9  god appeared to jacob once again while he was coming from padʹdanaʹram and blessed him
10  god said to him your name is jacob
your name will no longer be jacob but israel will be your name
and he began to call him israel
11  god further said to him i am god almighty
be fruitful and become many
nations and a congregation of nations will come from you and kings will descend from you
12  as for the land that i have given to abraham and to isaac to you i will give it and to your offspring after you i will give the land
13  then god went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him
14  so jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it
15  and jacob continued to call the place where god had spoken with him bethʹel
16  then they pulled away from bethʹel
and while they were still some distance from ephʹrath rachel began to give birth and her labor was very difficult
17  but while she was struggling to deliver the child the midwife said to her do not be afraid for you will have this son also
18  just as her life was slipping away for she was dying she named him benoʹni but his father called him benjamin
19  so rachel died and was buried on the way to ephʹrath that is bethʹlehem
20  jacob set up a pillar over her grave it is the pillar of rachels grave to this day
21  after that israel pulled away and pitched his tent a distance beyond the tower of eʹder
22  once while israel was dwelling in that land reuʹben went and lay down with bilʹhah his fathers concubine and israel heard about it
so there were 12 sons of jacob
23  the sons by leʹah were jacobs firstborn reuʹben then simʹeon leʹvi judah isʹsachar and zebʹulun
24  the sons by rachel were joseph and benjamin
25  and the sons by bilʹhah rachels servant were dan and naphʹtali
26  and the sons by zilʹpah leʹahs servant were gad and ashʹer
these are jacobs sons who were born to him in padʹdanaʹram
27  jacob eventually came to where his father isaac was at mamʹre to kirʹiatharʹba that is hebʹron where abraham and also isaac had resided as foreigners
28  isaac lived to be 180 years old
29  then isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people after a long and satisfying life and his sons eʹsau and jacob buried him
18  afterward jehovah appeared to him among the big trees of mamʹre while he was sitting at the entrance of the tent during the hottest part of the day
2  he looked up and saw three men standing some distance from him
when he saw them he ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them and he bowed down to the ground
3  then he said jehovah if i have found favor in your eyes please do not pass by your servant
4  please let a little water be brought and have your feet washed then recline under the tree
5  seeing that you have come here to your servant let me bring a piece of bread so that you may refresh yourselves
then you may go on your way
at this they said all right
you may do as you have spoken
6  so abraham hurried to the tent to sarah and said quick get three measures of fine flour knead the dough and make loaves of bread
7  next abraham ran to the herd and chose a tender and good young bull
he gave it to the attendant who hurried to prepare it
8  he then took butter and milk and the young bull that he had prepared and set the food before them
then he stood by them under the tree as they were eating
9  they said to him where is your wife sarah he replied here in the tent
10  so one of them continued i will surely return to you next year at this time and look your wife sarah will have a son
now sarah was listening at the tent entrance which was behind the man
11  abraham and sarah were old being advanced in years
sarah was past the age of childbearing
12  so sarah began to laugh to herself saying after i am worn out and my lord is old will i really have this pleasure
13  then jehovah said to abraham why did sarah laugh and say am i really going to give birth even though i am old
14  is anything too extraordinary for jehovah i will return to you next year at this appointed time and sarah will have a son
15  but sarah denied it saying i did not laugh for she was afraid
at this he said yes you did laugh
16  when the men got up to leave and looked down toward sodʹom abraham was walking with them to escort them
17  jehovah said am i keeping hidden from abraham what i am going to do
18  why abraham is surely going to become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth will be blessed by means of him
19  for i have come to know him in order that he may command his sons and his household after him to keep jehovahs way by doing what is right and just so that jehovah may bring about what he has promised concerning abraham
20  then jehovah said the outcry against sodʹom and gomorʹrah is indeed great and their sin is very heavy
21  i will go down to see whether they are acting according to the outcry that has reached me
and if not i can get to know it
22  then the men left from there and went toward sodʹom but jehovah remained with abraham
23  then abraham approached and said will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked
24  suppose there are 50 righteous men within the city
will you then sweep them away and not pardon the place for the sake of the 50 righteous who are inside it
25  it is unthinkable that you would act in this manner by putting the righteous man to death with the wicked one so that the outcome for the righteous man and the wicked is the same it is unthinkable of you
will the judge of all the earth not do what is right
26  then jehovah said if i find in sodʹom 50 righteous men in the city i will pardon the whole place for their sake
27  but abraham again responded please here i have presumed to speak to jehovah whereas i am dust and ashes
28  suppose the 50 righteous should lack five
because of the five will you destroy the whole city to this he said i will not destroy it if i find there 45
29  but yet again he spoke to him and said suppose 40 are found there
he answered i will not do it for the sake of the 40
30  but he continued jehovah please do not become hot with anger but let me go on speaking suppose only 30 are found there
he answered i will not do it if i find 30 there
31  but he continued please here i have presumed to speak to jehovah suppose only 20 are found there
he answered i will not destroy it for the sake of the 20
32  finally he said jehovah please do not become hot with anger but let me speak just once more suppose only ten are found there
he answered i will not destroy it for the sake of the ten
33  when jehovah finished speaking to abraham he went his way and abraham returned to his place
17  when aʹbram was 99 years old jehovah appeared to aʹbram and said to him i am god almighty
walk before me and prove yourself faultless
2  i will establish my covenant between me and you and i will multiply you very very much
3  at this aʹbram fell facedown and god continued to speak with him saying
4  as for me look my covenant is with you and you will certainly become a father of many nations
5  your name will no longer be aʹbram your name will become abraham for i will make you a father of many nations
6  i will make you very very fruitful and will make you become nations and kings will come from you
7  and i will keep my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be god to you and to your offspring after you
8  and i will give to you and to your offspring after you the land in which you lived as a foreignerthe entire land of caʹnaanfor a lasting possession and i will be their god
9  god said further to abraham as for you you are to keep my covenant you and your offspring after you throughout their generations
10  this is my covenant between me and you that you and your offspring after you will keep every male among you must get circumcised
11  you must circumcise the flesh of your foreskins and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you
12  throughout your generations every male among you eight days old must be circumcised anyone who is born in the house and anyone who is not one of your offspring and who was purchased with money from a foreigner
13  every man born in your house and every man purchased with your money must be circumcised and my covenant in your flesh must serve as a lasting covenant
14  if any uncircumcised male will not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin that person must be cut off from his people
he has broken my covenant
15  then god said to abraham as for your wife sarʹai you must not call her sarʹai because sarah will become her name
16  i will bless her and also give you a son by her i will bless her and she will become nations kings of peoples will come from her
17  at this abraham fell facedown and began to laugh and to say in his heart will a man 100 years old have a child born to him and will sarah a woman 90 years old give birth
18  so abraham said to the true god o that ishʹmael might live before you
19  to this god said your wife sarah will definitely bear you a son and you must name him isaac
and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant to his offspring after him
20  but as regards ishʹmael i have heard you
look i will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him very very much
he will produce 12 chieftains and i will make him become a great nation
21  however i will establish my covenant with isaac whom sarah will bear to you at this appointed time next year
22  when god finished speaking with him he went up from abraham
23  abraham then took ishʹmael his son and all the men born in his house and everyone he had purchased with money every male in the household of abraham and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that very day just as god had spoken with him
24  abraham was 99 years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised
25  and ishʹmael his son was 13 years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised
26  on that very day abraham was circumcised and also his son ishʹmael
27  all the men of his household anyone born in the house and anyone purchased with money from a foreigner were also circumcised with him
50  joseph then threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him
2  after that joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father
so the physicians embalmed israel
3  and they took the full 40 days for him for this is the full period for the embalming and the egyptians continued to shed tears for him 70 days
4  when the days of mourning for him passed joseph spoke to pharʹaohs court saying if i have found favor in your eyes give this message to pharʹaoh
5  my father made me swear saying look i am dying
you are to bury me in my burial place which i have excavated in the land of caʹnaan
please let me go up and bury my father after which i will return
6  pharʹaoh replied go and bury your father just as he made you swear
7  so joseph went up to bury his father and all of pharʹaohs servants went with him the elders of his court and all the elders of the land of egypt
8  and all of josephs household and his brothers and the household of his father
only their little children and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goʹshen
9  chariots and horsemen also went up with him and the camp was very numerous
10  then they came to the threshing floor of aʹtad which is in the region of the jordan and there they carried on a very great and bitter mourning and he kept mourning for his father seven days
11  the inhabitants of the land the caʹnaanites saw them mourning at the threshing floor of aʹtad and they exclaimed this is a great mourning for the egyptians that is why it was named aʹbelmizʹraim which is in the region of the jordan
12  so his sons did for him exactly as he had instructed them
13  his sons carried him into the land of caʹnaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpeʹlah the field in front of mamʹre that abraham had purchased from eʹphron the hitʹtite as property for a burial place
14  after he buried his father joseph returned to egypt with his brothers and all those who had gone with him to bury his father
15  when josephs brothers saw that their father was dead they said it may be that joseph is harboring animosity against us and that he will repay us for all the evil that we did to him
16  so they sent a message to joseph in these words your father gave this command before his death
17  this is what you are to say to joseph i beg you please pardon the transgression of your brothers and the sin they committed in bringing such harm to you
now please pardon the transgression of the servants of your fathers god
and joseph wept when they spoke to him
18  then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said here we are as slaves to you
19  joseph said to them do not be afraid
am i in the place of god
20  although you meant to harm me god intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive as he is doing today
21  so now do not be afraid
i will keep supplying you and your little children with food
thus he comforted them and spoke reassuringly to them
22  and joseph continued to dwell in egypt he and the household of his father and joseph lived for 110 years
23  joseph saw the third generation of eʹphraims sons also the sons of maʹchir manasʹsehs son
they were born upon josephs knees
24  at length joseph said to his brothers i am dying but god will without fail turn his attention to you and he will certainly bring you up out of this land to the land about which he swore to abraham to isaac and to jacob
25  so joseph made the sons of israel swear saying god will without fail turn his attention to you
you must take my bones up out of here
26  and joseph died at the age of 110 and they had him embalmed and he was put in a coffin in egypt
9  god went on to bless noah and his sons and to say to them be fruitful and become many and fill the earth
2  a fear of you and a terror of you will continue upon every living creature of the earth and upon every flying creature of the heavens upon everything that moves on the ground and upon all the fish of the sea
they are now given into your hand
3  every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you
just as i gave you the green vegetation i give them all to you
4  only flesh with its lifeits bloodyou must not eat
5  besides that i will demand an accounting for your lifeblood
i will demand an accounting from every living creature and from each man i will demand an accounting for the life of his brother
6  anyone shedding mans blood by man will his own blood be shed for in gods image he made man
7  as for you be fruitful and become many and increase abundantly on the earth and multiply
8  then god said to noah and to his sons with him
9  i am now establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you
10  and with every living creature that is with you the birds the animals and all the living creatures of the earth with you all those that came out of the arkevery living creature of the earth
11  yes i establish my covenant with you never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin
12  and god added this is the sign of the covenant that i am making between me and you and every living creature that is with you for all future generations
13  i put my rainbow in the cloud and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth
14  whenever i bring a cloud over the earth then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud
15  and i will certainly remember my covenant that i made between me and you and every living creature of every kind and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh
16  and the rainbow will occur in the cloud and i will certainly see it and remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of every kind on the earth
17  god repeated to noah this is the sign of the covenant that i establish between me and all flesh that is on the earth
18  noahs sons who came out of the ark were shem ham and jaʹpheth
ham later became the father of caʹnaan
19  these three were noahs sons and all the earths population came from them and spread abroad
20  now noah started off as a farmer and he planted a vineyard
21  when he drank of the wine he became intoxicated and he uncovered himself inside his tent
22  ham the father of caʹnaan saw his fathers nakedness and he told his two brothers outside
23  so shem and jaʹpheth took a garment and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backward
thus they covered their fathers nakedness while their faces were turned away and they did not see their fathers nakedness
24  when noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him
25  he said cursed be caʹnaan
let him become the lowest slave to his brothers
26  and he added praised be jehovah the god of shemand let caʹnaan become a slave to him
27  let god grant ample space to jaʹphethand let him reside in the tents of shem
let caʹnaan become a slave to him also
28  noah continued to live for 350 years after the flood
29  so all the days of noah amounted to 950 years and he died
28  so isaac called jacob and blessed him and commanded him saying you must not take a wife from the daughters of caʹnaan
2  go away to padʹdanaʹram to the house of bethuʹel your mothers father and from there take for yourself a wife from the daughters of laʹban your mothers brother
3  god almighty will bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you and you will certainly become a congregation of peoples
4  and he will give to you the blessing of abraham to you and to your offspring with you so that you may take possession of the land where you have been living as a foreigner which god has given to abraham
5  so isaac sent jacob away and he departed for padʹdanaʹram to laʹban the son of bethuʹel the aramaeʹan the brother of rebekʹah the mother of jacob and eʹsau
6  eʹsau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and had sent him away to padʹdanaʹram to take a wife from there and that when he blessed him he commanded him do not take a wife from the daughters of caʹnaan
7  and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and departed for padʹdanaʹram
8  eʹsau then realized that the daughters of caʹnaan were displeasing to his father isaac
9  so eʹsau went to ishʹmael and took as wife maʹhalath the daughter of abrahams son ishʹmael the sister of nebaʹioth in addition to the other wives he already had
10  jacob departed from beʹersheʹba and kept going toward haʹran
11  in time he came to a place and prepared to spend the night there because the sun had set
so he took one of the stones of that place and set it to rest his head on and lay down there
12  then he had a dream and look there was a stairway set on the earth and its top reached up to the heavens and there were gods angels ascending and descending on it
13  and look there was jehovah stationed above it and he said i am jehovah the god of abraham your father and the god of isaac
the land on which you are lying to you i am going to give it and to your offspring
14  and your offspring will certainly become like the dust particles of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and by means of you and by means of your offspring all the families of the ground will certainly be blessed
15  i am with you and i will safeguard you wherever you go and i will return you to this land
i will not leave you until i have done what i have promised you
16  then jacob awoke from his sleep and said truly jehovah is in this place and i did not know it
17  and he grew fearful and added how aweinspiring this place is this can only be the house of god and this is the gate of the heavens
18  so jacob got up early in the morning and took the stone on which he had rested his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it
19  so he named that place bethʹel but previously the citys name was luz
20  jacob then made a vow saying if god will continue with me and will protect me on my journey and will give me bread to eat and garments to wear
21  and i return in peace to the house of my father then jehovah will certainly have proved to be my god
22  and this stone that i have set up as a pillar will become a house of god and without fail i will give you a tenth of everything you give to me
27  now when isaac was old and his eyes were too weak to see he called eʹsau his older son to him and said my son he replied here i am
2  and he went on to say i have now grown old
i do not know the day of my death
3  so at this time take please your weapons your quiver and your bow and go out to the field and hunt some wild game for me
4  then make the kind of tasty dish that i am fond of and bring it to me
then i will eat it so that i may bless you before i die
5  however rebekʹah was listening while isaac spoke to eʹsau his son
and eʹsau went out into the field to hunt game and to bring it in
6  and rebekʹah said to jacob her son i just heard your father speaking to your brother eʹsau saying
7  bring me some game and make me a tasty dish
then let me eat so that i may bless you before jehovah before my death
8  and now my son listen carefully and do what i am instructing you
9  go please to the herd and get me two of the best young goats from there so that i may prepare from them a tasty dish for your father just the way he likes it
10  then take it to your father to eat in order that he may bless you before his death
11  jacob said to his mother rebekʹah but eʹsau my brother is a hairy man and my skin is smooth
12  what if my father feels me then i will certainly appear to be mocking him and i will bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing
13  at this his mother said to him upon me be the curse meant for you my son
just do as i say and go get them for me
14  so he went and got them and brought them to his mother and his mother made a tasty dish just the way his father liked it
15  after that rebekʹah took her older son eʹsaus finest garments which she had in the house and put them on her younger son jacob
16  she also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the hairless part of his neck
17  then she handed the tasty dish and the bread that she had made to her son jacob
18  so he went in to his father and said my father to which he said here i am who are you my son
19  jacob said to his father i am eʹsau your firstborn
i have done just as you told me
sit up please and eat some of my game so that you may bless me
20  at that isaac said to his son how were you so quick in finding it my son he replied because jehovah your god brought it to me
21  then isaac said to jacob come near please that i may feel you my son to know whether you are really my son eʹsau or not
22  so jacob came near to his father isaac and he felt him after which he said the voice is the voice of jacob but the hands are the hands of eʹsau
23  he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of his brother eʹsau
so he blessed him
24  after that he asked are you really my son eʹsau to which he replied i am
25  then he said bring me some of the wild game for me to eat my son then i will bless you
with that he brought it to him and he ate and he brought him wine and he drank
26  then isaac his father said to him come near please and kiss me my son
27  so he came near and kissed him and he could smell the scent of his garments
then he blessed him and said see the scent of my son is like the scent of the field that jehovah has blessed
28  may the true god give you the dews of the heavens and the fertile soils of the earth and an abundance of grain and new wine
29  let peoples serve you and let nations bow low to you
be master over your brothers and let the sons of your mother bow low to you
cursed be everyone who curses you and blessed be everyone who blesses you
30  now isaac had just finished blessing jacob and jacob had barely left the presence of his father isaac when his brother eʹsau came back from his hunting
31  he too prepared a tasty dish and brought it to his father and he said to his father let my father get up and eat some of his sons game in order that you may bless me
32  at this his father isaac said to him who are you to which he said i am your son your firstborn eʹsau
33  and isaac began to tremble violently so he said who was it then who hunted for game and brought it to me i already ate it before you arrived and i blessed himand he will surely be blessed
34  on hearing his fathers words eʹsau began to cry out in an extremely loud and bitter manner and to say to his father bless me yes me too my father
35  but he said your brother came deceitfully so that he might get the blessing meant for you
36  at this he said is he not rightly named jacob that he might supplant me these two times my birthright he has already taken and now he has taken my blessing then he added have you not reserved a blessing for me
37  but isaac answered eʹsau here i have appointed him master over you and i have given him all his brothers as servants and i have bestowed grain and new wine for his support
what is left that i can do for you my son
38  eʹsau said to his father is there just one blessing that you have my father bless me yes me too my father with that eʹsau cried loudly and burst into tears
39  so his father isaac answered him see away from the fertile soils of the earth your dwelling will be and away from the dew of the heavens above
40  and by your sword you will live and you will serve your brother
but when you grow restless you will indeed break his yoke off your neck
41  however eʹsau harbored animosity against jacob because of the blessing his father had given him and eʹsau kept saying in his heart the days of mourning for my father are getting closer
after that i am going to kill jacob my brother
42  when the words of her older son eʹsau were told to rebekʹah she at once sent for her younger son jacob and said to him look your brother eʹsau is planning to take revenge by killing you
43  now my son do as i say
get up and run away to my brother laʹban at haʹran
44  dwell with him for a while until your brothers rage calms down
45  until your brothers anger toward you subsides and he forgets what you have done to him
then i will send for you from there
why should i lose both of you in one day
46  after that rebekʹah kept saying to isaac i am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of heth
if jacob ever takes a wife from the daughters of heth like these daughters of the land what good is my life
7  after that jehovah said to noah go into the ark you and all your household because you are the one i have found to be righteous before me among this generation
2  you must take with you every kind of clean animal by sevens the male and its mate and of every animal that is not clean just two the male and its mate
3  also of the flying creatures of the sky by sevens male and female to preserve their offspring alive over all the earth
4  for in just seven days i will make it rain on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights and i will wipe from the surface of the ground every living thing that i have made
5  then noah did everything that jehovah had commanded him
6  noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth
7  so noah along with his sons his wife and his sons wives went into the ark ahead of the floodwaters
8  of every clean animal and of every animal that is not clean and of the flying creatures and of everything that moves on the ground
9  they went inside the ark to noah by twos male and female just as god had commanded noah
10  and seven days later the floodwaters came upon the earth
11  in the 600th year of noahs life in the second month on the 17th day of the month on that day all the springs of the vast watery deep burst open and the floodgates of the heavens were opened
12  and the rain poured down on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights
13  on that very day noah went into the ark along with his sons shem ham and jaʹpheth and his wife and the three wives of his sons
14  they went in with every wild animal according to its kind and every domestic animal according to its kind and every creeping animal of the earth according to its kind and every flying creature according to its kind every bird every winged creature
15  they kept going to noah inside the ark two by two of every sort of flesh that has the breath of life
16  so they went in male and female of every sort of flesh just as god had commanded him
after that jehovah shut the door behind him
17  the flooding continued for 40 days on the earth and the waters kept increasing and began carrying the ark and it was floating high above the earth
18  the waters became overwhelming and kept increasing greatly upon the earth but the ark floated on the surface of the waters
19  the waters overwhelmed the earth so greatly that all the tall mountains under the whole heavens were covered
20  the waters rose up to 15 cubits above the mountains
21  so all living creatures that were moving on the earth perishedthe flying creatures the domestic animals the wild animals the swarming creatures and all mankind
22  everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died
23  so he wiped every living thing from the surface of the earth including man animals creeping animals and the flying creatures of the sky
they were all wiped off the earth only noah and those with him in the ark survived
24  and the waters continued overwhelming the earth for 150 days
34  now diʹnah jacobs daughter by leʹah used to go out to spend time with the young women of the land
2  when sheʹchem the son of haʹmor the hiʹvite a chieftain of the land saw her he took her and lay down with her and violated her
3  and he became very attached to diʹnah the daughter of jacob and he fell in love with the young woman and spoke persuasively to her
4  finally sheʹchem said to haʹmor his father get me this young woman to be my wife
5  when jacob heard that he had defiled diʹnah his daughter his sons were with his herd in the field
so jacob kept silent until they returned
6  later haʹmor sheʹchems father went out to speak with jacob
7  but the sons of jacob heard about it and returned from the field right away
they were offended and very angry because he had disgraced israel by lying down with jacobs daughter something that should not be done
8  haʹmor spoke with them saying my son sheʹchem longs for your daughter
please give her to him as his wife
9  and form marriage alliances with us
give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves
10  you may dwell with us and the land will become available for you
dwell and carry on trade in it and settle in it
11  then sheʹchem said to her father and to her brothers let me find favor in your eyes and i will give you whatever you ask me
12  you can demand from me a very high bride price and gift
i am willing to give whatever you may say to me
just give me the young woman as a wife
13  and jacobs sons answered sheʹchem and haʹmor his father deceitfully because he had defiled diʹnah their sister
14  they said to them we cannot possibly do such a thing to give our sister to a man who is not circumcised for that is a disgrace to us
15  we can only consent on this condition that you become like us and circumcise all your males
16  then we will give our daughters to you and we will take your daughters for ourselves and we will dwell with you and become one people
17  but if you do not listen to us and get circumcised then we will take our daughter and go
18  their words pleased haʹmor and sheʹchem haʹmors son
19  the young man did not delay in doing what they asked because he found delight in jacobs daughter and he was the most honorable of the whole house of his father
20  so haʹmor and his son sheʹchem went to the city gate and spoke to the men of their city saying
21  these men wish to be at peace with us
let them dwell in the land and carry on trade in it for the land is large enough to accommodate them
we can take their daughters as wives and our daughters we can give to them
22  only on this one condition will the men consent to dwell with us in order to become one people that every male among us be circumcised just the way they are circumcised
23  then will not their possessions their wealth and all their livestock be ours so let us give them our consent that they may dwell with us
24  all those going out by the gate of his city listened to haʹmor and to his son sheʹchem and all the males got circumcised all those going out of the city gate
25  however on the third day when they were still in pain two sons of jacob simʹeon and leʹvi diʹnahs brothers each took his sword and went into the unsuspecting city and killed every male
26  they killed haʹmor and his son sheʹchem with the sword and then took diʹnah from sheʹchems house and left
27  jacobs other sons came upon the slain men and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister
28  they took their flocks their herds their donkeys and whatever was in the city and in the field
29  they also took all their possessions captured all their little children and their wives and plundered everything in the houses
30  at this jacob said to simʹeon and to leʹvi you have brought great trouble on me in making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land to the caʹnaanites and the perʹizzites
i am few in number and they will certainly gather together to attack me and i will be annihilated i and my house
31  but they said should anyone treat our sister like a prostitute
46  so israel took all that he had and departed
when he arrived at beʹersheʹba he offered sacrifices to the god of his father isaac
2  then god spoke to israel in a vision by night and said jacob jacob to which he said here i am
3  he said i am the true god the god of your father
do not be afraid to go down to egypt for there i will make you into a great nation
4  i myself will go down with you to egypt and i myself will also bring you back from there and joseph will lay his hand on your eyes
5  after that jacob departed from beʹersheʹba and the sons of israel transported jacob their father and their children and their wives in the wagons that pharʹaoh had sent to transport him
6  they took along their herds and their goods which they had accumulated in the land of caʹnaan
and so they came into egypt jacob and all his offspring with him
7  he brought with him into egypt his sons and his grandsons his daughters and his granddaughtersall his offspring
8  now these are the names of israels sons who came into egypt jacob and his sons jacobs firstborn was reuʹben
9  the sons of reuʹben were haʹnoch palʹlu hezʹron and carʹmi
10  the sons of simʹeon were jemuʹel jaʹmin oʹhad jaʹchin zoʹhar and shaʹul the son of a caʹnaanite woman
11  the sons of leʹvi were gerʹshon koʹhath and merarʹi
12  the sons of judah were er oʹnan sheʹlah peʹrez and zeʹrah
however er and oʹnan died in the land of caʹnaan
the sons of peʹrez came to be hezʹron and haʹmul
13  the sons of isʹsachar were toʹla puʹvah iob and shimʹron
14  the sons of zebʹulun were seʹred eʹlon and jahʹleel
15  these are the sons of leʹah whom she bore to jacob in padʹdanaʹram together with his daughter diʹnah
all his sons and his daughters numbered 33
16  the sons of gad were ziphʹion hagʹgi shuʹni ezʹbon eʹri aroʹdi and areʹli
17  the sons of ashʹer were imʹnah ishʹvah ishʹvi and beriʹah and their sister was seʹrah
the sons of beriʹah were heʹber and malʹchiel
18  these are the sons of zilʹpah whom laʹban gave to his daughter leʹah
she bore these to jacob 16 persons in all
19  the sons of jacobs wife rachel were joseph and benjamin
20  there were born to joseph in the land of egypt manasʹseh and eʹphraim whom asʹenath the daughter of potiʹphera the priest of on bore to him
21  the sons of benjamin were beʹla beʹcher ashʹbel geʹra naʹaman eʹhi rosh mupʹpim hupʹpim and ard
22  these are the sons of rachel who were born to jacob 14 persons in all
23  the son of dan was huʹshim
24  the sons of naphʹtali were jahʹzeel guʹni jeʹzer and shilʹlem
25  these are the sons of bilʹhah whom laʹban gave to his daughter rachel
she bore these to jacob seven persons in all
26  all those who descended from jacob and went into egypt with him aside from the wives of jacobs sons were 66
27  josephs sons who were born to him in egypt were two
all the people of the house of jacob who came into egypt were 70
28  jacob sent judah ahead to tell joseph that he was on the way to goʹshen
when they came into the land of goʹshen
29  joseph had his chariot prepared and went up to meet israel his father at goʹshen
when he presented himself to him he at once embraced him and wept for some time
30  then israel said to joseph now i am ready to die i have seen your face and know that you are still alive
31  joseph then said to his brothers and to his fathers household let me go up and report to pharʹaoh and tell him my brothers and my fathers household who were in the land of caʹnaan have come here to me
32  the men are shepherds and they raise livestock and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have
33  when pharʹaoh calls you and asks what is your occupation
34  you must say your servants have raised livestock from our youth until now both we and our forefathers so that you may dwell in the land of goʹshen for every herder of sheep is detestable to the egyptians
37  jacob continued to dwell in the land of caʹnaan where his father had lived as a foreigner
2  this is the history of jacob
when joseph was 17 years old the young man was tending the flock with the sons of bilʹhah and the sons of zilʹpah the wives of his father
and joseph brought a bad report about them to their father
3  now israel loved joseph more than all his other sons because he was the son of his old age and he had a special robe made for him
4  when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers they began to hate him and they could not speak peaceably to him
5  later joseph had a dream and told it to his brothers and they found further reason to hate him
6  he said to them please listen to this dream that i had
7  there we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field when my sheaf got up and stood erect and your sheaves encircled and bowed down to my sheaf
8  his brothers said to him are you really going to make yourself king over us and dominate us so they found another reason to hate him because of his dreams and what he said
9  after that he had still another dream and he related it to his brothers i have had another dream
this time the sun and the moon and 11 stars were bowing down to me
10  then he related it to his father as well as his brothers and his father rebuked him and said to him what is the meaning of this dream of yours am i as well as your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the earth to you
11  and his brothers grew jealous of him but his father kept the saying in mind
12  his brothers now went to pasture their fathers flock near sheʹchem
13  israel later said to joseph your brothers are tending flocks near sheʹchem are they not come and let me send you to them
at this he said to him i am ready
14  so he said to him go please and see whether your brothers are well
see how the flock is and bring word back to me
with that he sent him away from the valley of hebʹron and he went on toward sheʹchem
15  later a man found him as he was wandering in a field
the man asked him what are you looking for
16  to this he said i am looking for my brothers
please tell me where are they tending flocks
17  the man continued they have pulled away from here for i heard them saying let us go to doʹthan
so joseph went after his brothers and found them at doʹthan
18  now they caught sight of him from a distance and before he reached them they began plotting against him to put him to death
19  so they said to one another look here comes that dreamer
20  come now let us kill him and pitch him into one of the waterpits and we will say that a vicious wild animal devoured him
then let us see what will become of his dreams
21  when reuʹben heard this he tried to rescue him from them
so he said let us not take his life
22  reuʹben said to them do not shed blood
throw him into this waterpit in the wilderness but do not harm him
his purpose was to rescue him from them in order to return him to his father
23  so as soon as joseph came to his brothers they stripped joseph of his robe the special robe that he wore
24  and they took him and threw him into the waterpit
at the time the pit was empty there was no water in it
25  then they sat down to eat
when they looked up there was a caravan of ishʹmaelites coming from gilʹead
their camels were carrying labdanum gum balsam and resinous bark and they were on their way down to egypt
26  at this judah said to his brothers what profit would there be if we killed our brother and covered over his blood
27  come now let us sell him to the ishʹmaelites and do not let our hand be upon him
after all he is our brother our flesh
so they listened to their brother
28  and when the midʹianite merchants were passing by they lifted joseph up out of the waterpit and sold him to the ishʹmaelites for 20 pieces of silver
these men took joseph into egypt
29  later when reuʹben returned to the waterpit and saw that joseph was not in the waterpit he ripped his garments apart
30  when he returned to his brothers he exclaimed the child is gone and iwhat am i going to do
31  so they took josephs robe and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the robe in the blood
32  after that they sent the special robe to their father and said this is what we found
please examine whether this is your sons robe or not
33  then he examined it and exclaimed it is my sons robe a vicious wild animal must have devoured him joseph is surely torn to pieces
34  with that jacob ripped his garments apart and put sackcloth around his waist and mourned his son for many days
35  and all his sons and all his daughters kept trying to comfort him but he kept refusing to take comfort saying i will go down into the grave mourning my son and his father continued weeping for him
36  now the midʹianites sold him in egypt to potʹiphar a court official of pharʹaoh and the chief of the guard
45  at this joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants
so he cried out have everyone leave me no one else stayed with him while joseph made himself known to his brothers
2  then he began to weep so loudly that the egyptians heard it and pharʹaohs house heard it
3  finally joseph said to his brothers i am joseph
is my father still alive but his brothers were unable to answer him at all because they were astonished on account of him
4  so joseph said to his brothers come close to me please
with that they came close to him
then he said i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt
5  but now do not be upset and do not reproach one another because you sold me here because god has sent me ahead of you for the preservation of life
6  this is the second year of the famine in the land and there are yet five years in which there will be no plowing or harvest
7  but god sent me ahead of you in order to preserve for you a remnant on the earth and to keep you alive by a great deliverance
8  so then it was not you who sent me here but it was the true god in order to appoint me as chief adviser to pharʹaoh and lord for all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt
9  return quickly to my father and you must say to him this is what your son joseph has said god has appointed me lord over all egypt
come down to me
do not delay
10  you must dwell in the land of goʹshen where you will be near meyou your sons your grandsons your flocks your herds and everything you have
11  i will supply you with food there for there are yet five years of famine
otherwise you and your house and everything you have will come to poverty
12  you and my brother benjamin can now see with your own eyes that i am really the one speaking to you
13  so you must tell my father about all my glory in egypt and everything you have seen
now hurry and bring my father down here
14  then he embraced his brother benjamin and gave way to weeping and benjamin wept with his arms around his neck
15  and he kissed all his brothers and wept over them and after that his brothers spoke with him
16  the news reached the house of pharʹaoh josephs brothers have come it was good in the eyes of pharʹaoh and his servants
17  so pharʹaoh said to joseph tell your brothers do this load your beasts of burden and go to the land of caʹnaan
18  and take your father and your households and come here to me
i will give you the good things of the land of egypt and you will eat the richest part of the land
19  and you are commanded to tell them do this take wagons from the land of egypt for your children and your wives and you must bring your father on one of them and come here
20  do not worry about your belongings for the best of all the land of egypt is yours
21  and the sons of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to pharʹaohs orders and he gave them provisions for the journey
22  to each of them he gave individual changes of clothing but to benjamin he gave 300 silver pieces and five changes of clothing
23  and to his father he sent the following ten donkeys carrying good things of egypt and ten female donkeys carrying grain and bread and sustenance for his father for the journey
24  so he sent his brothers off and as they departed he said to them do not become upset with one another on the way
25  then they went up from egypt and came into the land of caʹnaan to their father jacob
26  then they reported to him joseph is still alive and he is the ruler over all the land of egypt but his heart grew numb because he did not believe them
27  when they went on telling him all the words that joseph had spoken to them and when he saw the wagons that joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of their father jacob began to revive
28  israel exclaimed it is enough my son joseph is still alive i must go and see him before i die
23  and sarah lived for 127 years these were the years of sarahs life
2  so sarah died in kirʹiatharʹba that is hebʹron in the land of caʹnaan and abraham began to mourn and to weep over sarah
3  then abraham got up from before his dead wife and he said to the sons of heth
4  i am a foreigner and settler among you
give me a property to serve as a burial place in your midst so that i may remove my dead for burial
5  at this the sons of heth answered abraham
6  hear us my lord
you are a chieftain of god among us
you may bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places
none of us will hold back his burial place from you to prevent you from burying your dead
7  so abraham got up and bowed down to the people of the land to the sons of heth
8  and said to them if you agree to let me remove my dead for burial then listen to me and urge eʹphron the son of zoʹhar
9  to sell me the cave of machpeʹlah which belongs to him it is at the edge of his field
let him sell it to me in your presence for the full amount of silver so that i may have a property for a burial place
10  now eʹphron was sitting among the sons of heth
so eʹphron the hitʹtite answered abraham in the hearing of the sons of heth and before all who entered the gate of his city saying
11  no my lord listen to me
i give you both the field and the cave that is in it
in the presence of the sons of my people i give it to you
bury your dead
12  at that abraham bowed down before the people of the land
13  and spoke to eʹphron in the hearing of the people saying listen to me if you will i will give you the full amount of silver for the field
take it from me in order that i may bury my dead there
14  then eʹphron answered abraham
15  my lord listen to me
this land is worth 400 silver shekels but what is that between me and you so bury your dead
16  abraham listened to eʹphron and abraham weighed out to eʹphron the amount of silver that he had mentioned in the hearing of the sons of heth 400 silver shekels according to the weight accepted by the merchants
17  thus the field of eʹphron in machpeʹlah which was in front of mamʹrethe field and the cave in it and all the trees within the boundaries of the fieldbecame confirmed as
18  abrahams purchased property in the presence of the sons of heth before all those entering the gate of his city
19  after that abraham buried his wife sarah in the cave of the field of machpeʹlah in front of mamʹre that is hebʹron in the land of caʹnaan
20  thus the field and the cave that was in it were transferred by the sons of heth to abraham as property for a burial place
42  when jacob learned that there was grain in egypt he said to his sons why do you just keep looking at one another
2  he added i have heard that there is grain in egypt
go down there and buy some for us so that we may stay alive and not die
3  so ten of josephs brothers went down to buy grain from egypt
4  but jacob did not send benjamin josephs brother with his other brothers for he said perhaps a fatal accident may befall him
5  so israels sons came along with the others who were coming to buy because the famine had extended to the land of caʹnaan
6  joseph was the man in authority over the land and he was the one who sold grain to all the people of the earth
so josephs brothers came and bowed low to him with their faces to the ground
7  when joseph saw his brothers he immediately recognized them but he concealed his identity from them
so he spoke harshly with them and said where have you come from to which they said from the land of caʹnaan to buy food
8  thus joseph recognized his brothers but they did not recognize him
9  joseph immediately remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them and he said to them you are spies you have come to see the vulnerable areas of the land
10  then they said to him no my lord but your servants have come to buy food
11  we are all sons of but one man
we are upright men
your servants do not act as spies
12  but he said to them not so you have come to see the vulnerable areas of the land
13  at this they said your servants are 12 brothers
we are the sons of but one man in the land of caʹnaan and the youngest is now with our father whereas the other one is no more
14  however joseph said to them it is just as i said to youyou are spies
15  by this you will be tested as surely as pharʹaoh lives you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here
16  send one of you to bring your brother while you remain in bondage
in this way your words may be tested out to see if you are telling the truth
and if not then as surely as pharʹaoh lives you are spies
17  with that he put them together in custody for three days
18  joseph said to them on the third day do this and live for i fear god
19  if you are upright let one of your brothers remain in bondage in your house of custody but the rest of you may go and take grain to alleviate the famine in your households
20  then bring your youngest brother to me so that your words will be found trustworthy and you will not die
and they did so
21  and they said to one another we are surely being punished on account of our brother because we saw his distress when he begged us to show compassion but we did not listen
that is why this distress has come upon us
22  then reuʹben answered them did i not say to you do not sin against the child but you would not listen now his blood is certainly being asked back
23  but they did not know that joseph understood for there was an interpreter between them
24  so he turned away from them and began to weep
when he returned and spoke to them again he took simʹeon from them and bound him before their eyes
25  joseph then gave the command to fill up their bags with grain and to return each mans money to his own sack and to give them provisions for the journey
this was done for them
26  so they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left from there
27  when one of them opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place he saw his money there in the mouth of his bag
28  at that he said to his brothers my money has been returned and now here it is in my bag then their hearts sank and trembling they turned to one another and said what is this that god has done to us
29  when they came to jacob their father in the land of caʹnaan they told him all the things that had befallen them saying
30  the man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly with us and accused us of spying on the country
31  but we said to him we are upright men
we are not spies
32  we are 12 brothers the sons of our father
one is no more and the youngest is now with our father in the land of caʹnaan
33  but the man who is the lord of the country said to us by this i will know that you are upright leave one of your brothers with me
then take something to alleviate the famine in your households and go
34  and bring your youngest brother to me so that i may know that you are not spies but upright men
i will then give your brother back to you and you may carry on trade in the land
35  as they were emptying their sacks here was each ones bag of money in his sack
when they and their father saw their bags of money they became afraid
36  jacob their father exclaimed to them it is i you have bereaved joseph is no more and simʹeon is no more and you are going to take benjamin it is upon me that all these things have come
37  but reuʹben said to his father you may put to death my own two sons if i do not bring him back to you
give him over to my care and i will return him to you
38  however he said my son will not go down with you because his brother is dead and he alone is left
if a fatal accident should befall him on the journey you would make then you would certainly bring down my gray hairs to the grave in grief
22  now after this the true god put abraham to the test and he said to him abraham to which he replied here i am
2  then he said take please your son your only son whom you so love isaac and travel to the land of moriʹah and offer him up there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that i will designate to you
3  so abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his servants along with him and his son isaac
he split the wood for the burnt offering and then he rose and traveled to the place that the true god indicated to him
4  on the third day abraham looked up and saw the place from a distance
5  abraham now said to his servants you stay here with the donkey but the boy and i will go over there and worship and return to you
6  so abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son isaac
then he took in his hands the fire and the knife and the two of them walked on together
7  then isaac said to his father abraham my father he replied yes my son so he continued here are the fire and the wood but where is the sheep for the burnt offering
8  to this abraham said god himself will provide the sheep for the burnt offering my son
and both of them walked on together
9  finally they reached the place that the true god had indicated to him and abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it
he bound his son isaac hand and foot and put him on the altar on top of the wood
10  then abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son
11  but jehovahs angel called to him from the heavens and said abraham abraham to which he answered here i am
12  then he said do not harm the boy and do not do anything at all to him for now i do know that you are godfearing because you have not withheld your son your only one from me
13  at that abraham looked up and there just beyond him was a ram caught by its horns in a thicket
so abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son
14  and abraham named that place jehoʹvahjiʹreh
this is why it is still said today in the mountain of jehovah it will be provided
15  and jehovahs angel called to abraham a second time from the heavens
16  saying by myself i swear declares jehovah that because you have done this and you have not withheld your son your only one
17  i will surely bless you and i will surely multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand on the seashore and your offspring will take possession of the gate of his enemies
18  and by means of your offspring all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves because you have listened to my voice
19  after that abraham returned to his servants and they got up and went back together to beʹersheʹba and abraham continued to dwell at beʹersheʹba
20  after this it was reported to abraham here milʹcah has also borne sons to naʹhor your brother
21  uz his firstborn buz his brother kemuʹel the father of aʹram
22  cheʹsed haʹzo pilʹdash jidʹlaph and bethuʹel
23  bethuʹel became the father of rebekʹah
milʹcah bore these eight to naʹhor the brother of abraham
24  his concubine whose name was reuʹmah also bore sons teʹbah gaʹham taʹhash and maʹacah
38  about that time judah left his brothers and pitched his tent near an adulʹlamite man named hiʹrah
2  there judah saw the daughter of a certain caʹnaanite named shuʹa
so he took her and had relations with her
3  and she became pregnant
later she bore a son and he named him er
4  again she became pregnant and bore a son and named him oʹnan
5  yet again she bore a son and named him sheʹlah
he was in achʹzib when she bore him
6  in time judah took a wife for er his firstborn and her name was taʹmar
7  but er judahs firstborn was displeasing to jehovah so jehovah put him to death
8  in view of that judah said to oʹnan have relations with your brothers wife and perform brotherinlaw marriage with her and raise up offspring for your brother
9  but oʹnan knew that the offspring would not be considered his
so when he did have relations with his brothers wife he wasted his semen on the ground so as not to give offspring to his brother
10  what he did was bad in the eyes of jehovah so he also put him to death
11  judah said to taʹmar his daughterinlaw dwell as a widow in the house of your father until my son sheʹlah grows up for he said to himself he too may die like his brothers
so taʹmar went and stayed in her own fathers house
12  some time passed and judahs wife the daughter of shuʹa died
judah kept the mourning period and then he went to his sheepshearers in timʹnah with his companion hiʹrah the adulʹlamite
13  taʹmar was told here your fatherinlaw is going up to timʹnah to shear his sheep
14  with that she removed her widows clothing and veiled herself and covered herself with a shawl and sat down at the entrance of enaʹim which is on the road to timʹnah for she saw that sheʹlah had grown up and yet she had not been given to him as a wife
15  when judah caught sight of her he at once took her for a prostitute because she had covered her face
16  so he turned aside to her by the road and said allow me please to have relations with you for he did not know that she was his daughterinlaw
however she said what will you give me that you may have relations with me
17  to this he said i will send a young goat from my herd
but she said will you give a security until you send it
18  he continued what security should i give you to which she said your seal ring and your cord and your rod that is in your hand
then he gave them to her and had relations with her and she became pregnant by him
19  after that she got up and went away and removed her shawl and clothed herself with her widows clothing
20  and judah sent the young goat by the hand of his companion the adulʹlamite to get back the security from the hand of the woman but he never found her
21  he inquired of the men of her place saying where is that temple prostitute in enaʹim along the road but they said no temple prostitute has ever been in this place
22  finally he returned to judah and said i never found her and besides the men of the place said no temple prostitute has ever been in this place
23  so judah said let her take them for herself in order that we may not fall into contempt
at any rate i have sent this young goat but you never found her
24  however about three months later judah was told taʹmar your daughterinlaw has acted as a prostitute and she is also pregnant by her prostitution
at that judah said bring her out and let her be burned
25  as she was being brought out she sent word to her fatherinlaw i am pregnant by the man to whom these belong
then she added please examine to whom these belong the seal ring and the cord and the rod
26  then judah examined them and said she is more righteous than i am because i did not give her to sheʹlah my son
and he had no further sexual relations with her after that
27  when the time came for her to give birth there were twins in her womb
28  as she was giving birth one put out his hand and the midwife immediately took a scarlet thread and tied it around his hand saying this one came out first
29  but as soon as he drew back his hand his brother came out and she exclaimed what a breach you have made for yourself so he was named peʹrez
30  afterward his brother came out around whose hand the scarlet thread was tied and he was named zeʹrah
32  jacob then went on his way and the angels of god met up with him
2  as soon as he saw them jacob said this is the camp of god so he named that place mahanaʹim
3  then jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother eʹsau in the land of seʹir the territory of eʹdom
4  and he commanded them this is what you will say to my lord to eʹsau this is what your servant jacob says i have resided with laʹban for a long time until now
5  and i have acquired bulls donkeys sheep and male and female servants and i send this message to inform my lord in order to find favor in your eyes
6  in time the messengers returned to jacob saying we met your brother eʹsau and he is now on his way to meet you and there are 400 men with him
7  and jacob became very frightened and anxious
so he divided the people who were with him as well as the flocks the cattle and the camels into two camps
8  he said if eʹsau attacks the one camp then the other camp will be able to escape
9  after that jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac o jehovah you who are saying to me return to your land and to your relatives and i will deal well with you
10  i am unworthy of all the loyal love and of all the faithfulness that you have shown toward your servant for with only my staff i crossed this jordan and now i have become two camps
11  save me i pray you from the hand of my brother eʹsau for i am afraid of him that he may come and attack me as well as the mothers and their children
12  and you have said i will certainly deal well with you and i will make your offspring like the grains of sand of the sea which are too numerous to count
13  and he spent the night there
then he took some of his possessions as a gift for eʹsau his brother
14  200 female goats 20 male goats 200 female sheep 20 rams
15  30 camels nursing their young 40 cows 10 bulls 20 female donkeys and 10 fullgrown male donkeys
16  he handed them over to his servants one drove after another and he said to his servants cross over ahead of me and you are to set a space between one drove and the next
17  he also commanded the first one in case eʹsau my brother should meet you and ask to whom do you belong and where are you going and to whom do these ahead of you belong
18  then you should say to your servant jacob
it is a gift sent to my lord to eʹsau and look he himself is also behind us
19  and he commanded also the second the third and all those following the droves according to this word you are to speak to eʹsau when you meet him
20  and you should also say here is your servant jacob behind us
for he said to himself if i appease him by sending a gift ahead of me then afterward when i see him he may give me a kindly reception
21  so the gift crossed over ahead of him but he himself spent the night in the camp
22  later during that night he rose and took his two wives and his two female servants and his 11 young sons and crossed over the ford of jabʹbok
23  so he took them and brought them across the stream and he brought over everything else he had
24  finally jacob was left by himself
then a man began to wrestle with him until the dawn broke
25  when he saw that he had not prevailed over him he touched the socket of his hip and the socket of jacobs hip was dislocated during his wrestling with him
26  after that he said let me go for the dawn is breaking
to this he said i am not going to let you go until you bless me
27  so he said to him what is your name to which he said jacob
28  then he said your name will no longer be jacob but israel for you have contended with god and with men and you have at last prevailed
29  in turn jacob inquired tell me please your name
however he said why is it that you ask my name with that he blessed him there
30  so jacob named the place peniʹel for he said i have seen god facetoface yet my life was preserved
31  and the sun rose upon him as soon as he passed by penuʹel but he was limping because of his hip
32  that is why to this day the sons of israel are not accustomed to eat the thigh sinew which is on the socket of the hip joint because he touched the socket of jacobs hip joint by the thigh sinew
6  now when men started to grow in number on the surface of the ground and daughters were born to them
2  the sons of the true god began to notice that the daughters of men were beautiful
so they began taking as wives all whom they chose
3  then jehovah said my spirit will not tolerate man indefinitely because he is only flesh
accordingly his days will amount to 120 years
4  the nephʹilim were on the earth in those days and afterward
during that time the sons of the true god continued to have relations with the daughters of men and these bore sons to them
they were the mighty ones of old times the men of fame
5  consequently jehovah saw that mans wickedness was great on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time
6  jehovah regretted that he had made men on the earth and his heart was saddened
7  so jehovah said i am going to wipe men whom i have created off the surface of the ground man together with domestic animals creeping animals and flying creatures of the heavens for i regret that i have made them
8  but noah found favor in the eyes of jehovah
9  this is the history of noah
noah was a righteous man
he proved himself faultless among his contemporaries
noah walked with the true god
10  in time noah became father to three sons shem ham and jaʹpheth
11  but the earth had become ruined in the sight of the true god and the earth was filled with violence
12  yes god looked upon the earth and it was ruined all flesh had ruined its way on the earth
13  after that god said to noah i have decided to put an end to all flesh because the earth is full of violence on account of them so i am bringing them to ruin together with the earth
14  make for yourself an ark from resinous wood
you will make compartments in the ark and cover it with tar inside and outside
15  this is how you will make it the ark should be 300 cubits long 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high
16  you will make a window for light for the ark one cubit from the top
you should put the entrance of the ark in its side and make it with a lower deck a second deck and a third deck
17  as for me i am going to bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy from under the heavens all flesh that has the breath of life
everything on the earth will perish
18  and i am establishing my covenant with you and you must go into the ark you your sons your wife and your sons wives with you
19  and bring into the ark two of every sort of living creature in order to preserve them alive with you a male and a female
20  of the flying creatures according to their kinds the domestic animals according to their kinds and all creeping animals of the ground according to their kinds two of each will go in there to you to preserve them alive
21  for your part you are to collect and take with you every kind of food to eat to serve as food for you and for the animals
22  and noah did according to all that god had commanded him
he did just so
31  in time he heard what the sons of laʹban were saying jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father and from what belonged to our father he has amassed all this wealth
2  when jacob would look at the face of laʹban he saw that his attitude toward him was not what it used to be
3  finally jehovah said to jacob return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives and i will continue with you
4  then jacob sent a message to rachel and leʹah to come out to the field to his flock
5  and he said to them i have seen that your fathers attitude toward me has changed but the god of my father has been with me
6  you yourselves certainly know that i have served your father with all my power
7  and your father has tried to cheat me and has changed my wages ten times but god has not allowed him to do me harm
8  if on the one hand he would say the speckled ones will be your wages then the whole flock produced speckled ones but if on the other hand he would say the striped ones will be your wages then the whole flock produced striped ones
9  so god kept taking your fathers livestock away from him and giving it to me
10  once when the flock got into heat i raised my eyes and saw in a dream that the hegoats mating with the flock were striped speckled and spotty
11  then the angel of the true god said to me in the dream jacob to which i said here i am
12  and he continued raise your eyes please and see that all the hegoats mating with the flock are striped speckled and spotty for i have seen all that laʹban is doing to you
13  i am the true god of bethʹel where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me
now get up go out of this land and return to the land of your birth
14  at this rachel and leʹah answered him is there any share left for us to inherit in our fathers house
15  does he not consider us as foreigners since he has sold us and has been using up the money given for us
16  all the riches that god has taken away from our father are ours and our childrens
so then do everything that god has told you to do
17  then jacob got up and lifted his children and his wives on the camels
18  and he began driving all his herd and all the goods that he had accumulated the livestock in his possession that he had accumulated in padʹdanaʹram to go to isaac his father in the land of caʹnaan
19  now laʹban had gone to shear his sheep and rachel stole the teraphim statues that belonged to her father
20  moreover jacob outwitted laʹban the aramaeʹan for he had not told him that he was running away
21  and he ran away and crossed the river he and all he had
then he headed toward the mountainous region of gilʹead
22  on the third day laʹban was told that jacob had run away
23  so he took his brothers with him and pursued him for a journey of seven days and caught up with him in the mountainous region of gilʹead
24  then god came to laʹban the aramaeʹan in a dream by night and said to him be careful about what you say to jacob either good or bad
25  so laʹban approached jacob as jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and laʹban had encamped with his brothers in the mountainous region of gilʹead
26  then laʹban said to jacob what have you done why have you resorted to outwitting me and carrying my daughters off like captives taken by the sword
27  why did you run away secretly and outwit me and not tell me if you had told me i could have sent you away with rejoicing and with songs with tambourine and with harp
28  but you did not give me a chance to kiss my grandchildren and my daughters
you have acted foolishly
29  it is in my power to do harm to you but the god of your father spoke to me last night saying be careful about what you say to jacob either good or bad
30  now you have gone because you have been longing to return to the house of your father but why have you stolen my gods
31  jacob answered laʹban it was because i was afraid for i said to myself you might take your daughters away from me by force
32  anyone with whom you find your gods will not live
before our brothers examine what i have and take what is yours
but jacob did not know that rachel had stolen them
33  so laʹban went into the tent of jacob and into the tent of leʹah and into the tent of the two slave girls but did not find them
then he came out of leʹahs tent and went into rachels tent
34  meanwhile rachel had taken the teraphim statues and put them in the womans saddle basket of the camel and she was sitting on them
so laʹban searched through the whole tent but did not find them
35  then she said to her father do not be angry my lord because i am not able to get up before you for the customary thing with women is upon me
so he searched on carefully but did not find the teraphim statues
36  at that jacob became angry and began to criticize laʹban
jacob then said to laʹban what is my offense and for what sin are you hotly pursuing me
37  now that you have searched through all my goods what have you found that belongs to your house put it here in front of my brothers and your brothers and let them decide between the two of us
38  during these 20 years that i have been with you your sheep and your goats never miscarried and i never ate the rams of your flock
39  i did not bring you any animal torn by wild beasts
i would stand the loss of it myself
whether the animal was stolen by day or was stolen by night you would demand compensation from me
40  by day the heat consumed me and the cold by night and sleep would flee from my eyes
41  this makes 20 years for me in your house
i have served you 14 years for your two daughters and 6 years for your flock and you kept changing my wages ten times
42  if the god of my father the god of abraham and the one whom isaac fears had not been on my side you would now have sent me away emptyhanded
god has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands and that is why he reproved you last night
43  then laʹban answered jacob the daughters are my daughters and the children my children and the flock my flock and everything you are looking at is mine and my daughters
what can i do today against these or against their children whom they have borne
44  now come let us make a covenant you and i and it will serve as a witness between us
45  so jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar
46  then jacob said to his brothers pick up stones and they took stones and made a pile
after that they ate there on the pile of stones
47  and laʹban began calling it jeʹgarsahaduʹtha but jacob called it galʹeed
48  laʹban then said this pile of stones is a witness between me and you today
that is why he named it galʹeed
49  and the watchtower for he said let jehovah keep watch between you and me when we are out of each others sight
50  if you mistreat my daughters and if you start taking wives in addition to my daughters though there is no man with us remember that god will be a witness between you and me
51  laʹban went on to say to jacob here is this pile of stones and here is the pillar that i have erected between you and me
52  this pile of stones is a witness and the pillar is something that bears witness that i will not pass beyond this pile of stones to bring harm to you and you will not pass beyond this pile of stones and this pillar to bring harm to me
53  let the god of abraham and the god of naʹhor the god of their father judge between us
and jacob swore by the one whom his father isaac fears
54  after that jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain and invited his brothers to eat bread
so they ate and spent the night in the mountain
55  however laʹban got up early in the morning and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them
then laʹban departed and returned home
21  jehovah turned his attention to sarah just as he had said and jehovah did for sarah what he had promised
2  so sarah became pregnant and then bore a son to abraham in his old age at the appointed time god had promised him
3  abraham named his newborn son whom sarah bore to him isaac
4  and abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old just as god had commanded him
5  abraham was 100 years old when his son isaac was born to him
6  then sarah said god has brought me laughter everybody hearing of it will laugh with me
7  and she added who would have said to abraham sarah will certainly nurse children yet i have given birth to a son for him in his old age
8  now the child grew and was weaned and abraham prepared a big feast on the day that isaac was weaned
9  but sarah kept noticing that the son of haʹgar the egyptian whom she had borne to abraham was mocking isaac
10  so she said to abraham drive out this slave girl and her son for the son of this slave girl is not going to be an heir along with my son with isaac
11  but what she said about his son was very displeasing to abraham
12  then god said to abraham do not be displeased by what sarah is saying to you about the boy and about your slave girl
listen to her for what will be called your offspring will be through isaac
13  as for the son of the slave girl i will also make a nation out of him because he is your offspring
14  so abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin bottle of water and gave it to haʹgar
he set these on her shoulder and then sent her away along with the boy
so she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of beʹersheʹba
15  finally the water in the skin bottle was used up and she pushed the boy under one of the bushes
16  then she went on and sat down by herself about the distance of a bowshot away because she said i do not want to watch the boy die
so she sat down at a distance and began to cry aloud and to weep
17  at that god heard the voice of the boy and gods angel called to haʹgar from the heavens and said to her what is the matter with you haʹgar do not be afraid for god has heard the voice of the boy there where he is
18  get up lift the boy and take hold of him with your hand for i will make him a great nation
19  then god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the skin bottle with water and gave the boy a drink
20  and god was with the boy as he grew up
he lived in the wilderness and became an archer
21  he took up dwelling in the wilderness of paʹran and his mother took a wife for him from the land of egypt
22  at that time abimʹelech together with phiʹcol the chief of his army said to abraham god is with you in everything you are doing
23  so now swear to me here by god that you will not deal falsely with me and with my offspring and with my descendants and that you will deal with me and with the land where you have been residing with the same loyal love that i have shown you
24  so abraham said i swear to this
25  however abraham complained to abimʹelech about the well of water that the servants of abimʹelech had violently seized
26  abimʹelech replied i do not know who did this you did not tell me about it and i heard nothing about it until today
27  at that abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to abimʹelech and the two of them made a covenant
28  when abraham set seven female lambs apart from the flock by themselves
29  abimʹelech said to abraham why have you set these seven female lambs here by themselves
30  then he said you are to accept the seven female lambs from my hand as a witness that i dug this well
31  that is why he called that place beʹersheʹba because there both of them had taken an oath
32  so they made a covenant at beʹersheʹba after which abimʹelech got up together with phiʹcol the chief of his army and they returned to the land of the philisʹtines
33  after that he planted a tamarisk tree at beʹersheʹba and there he called on the name of jehovah the everlasting god
34  and abraham stayed in the land of the philisʹtines for a long time
25  now abraham again took a wife and her name was ketuʹrah
2  in time she bore him zimʹran jokʹshan meʹdan midʹian ishʹbak and shuʹah
3  jokʹshan became father to sheʹba and deʹdan
the sons of deʹdan were asshuʹrim letuʹshim and leumʹmim
4  the sons of midʹian were eʹphah eʹpher haʹnoch abiʹda and eldaʹah
all of these were the sons of ketuʹrah
5  later on abraham gave everything he had to isaac
6  but abraham gave gifts to his sons by his concubines
then while he was still alive he sent them eastward away from isaac his son to the land of the east
7  the years of abrahams life were 175 years
8  then abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age old and satisfied and was gathered to his people
9  his sons isaac and ishʹmael buried him in the cave of machpeʹlah in the field of eʹphron the son of zoʹhar the hitʹtite that is in front of mamʹre
10  the field that abraham had purchased from the sons of heth
there abraham was buried with his wife sarah
11  after abrahams death god continued to bless his son isaac and isaac was dwelling near beʹerlaʹhairoi
12  this is the history of ishʹmael the son of abraham whom haʹgar the egyptian the servant of sarah bore to abraham
13  now these are the names of the sons of ishʹmael by their names according to their family origins ishʹmaels firstborn nebaʹioth then keʹdar adʹbeel mibʹsam
14  mishʹma duʹmah masʹsa
15  haʹdad teʹma jeʹtur naʹphish and kedʹemah
16  these are the sons of ishʹmael and these are their names by their settlements and by their encampments 12 chieftains according to their clans
17  and ishʹmael lived for 137 years
then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people
18  and they took up dwelling from havʹilah near shur which is close to egypt as far as assyrʹia
he settled near all his brothers
19  and this is the history of isaac the son of abraham
abraham became father to isaac
20  isaac was 40 years old when he married rebekʹah the daughter of bethuʹel the aramaeʹan of padʹdanaʹram the sister of laʹban the aramaeʹan
21  and isaac kept pleading with jehovah regarding his wife because she was barren so jehovah responded to his plea and his wife rebekʹah became pregnant
22  and the sons within her began to struggle with each other so that she said if this is the way it is why should i go on living so she inquired of jehovah
23  and jehovah said to her two nations are in your womb and two peoples will be separated from within you and the one nation will be stronger than the other nation and the older will serve the younger
24  when the time came for her to give birth look twins were in her womb
25  then the first came out red all over and was like a garment of hair so they named him eʹsau
26  after that his brother came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of eʹsau so he named him jacob
isaac was 60 years old when she gave birth to them
27  as the boys got bigger eʹsau became a skilled hunter a man of the field but jacob was a blameless man dwelling in tents
28  and isaac loved eʹsau because it meant game in his mouth whereas rebekʹah loved jacob
29  on one occasion jacob was boiling some stew when eʹsau returned from the field exhausted
30  so eʹsau said to jacob quick please give me some of the red stew that you have there for i am exhausted that is why his name was eʹdom
31  to this jacob said first sell me your right as firstborn
32  and eʹsau continued here i am about to die what use is a birthright to me
33  and jacob added swear to me first so he swore to him and sold his right as firstborn to jacob
34  then jacob gave eʹsau bread and lentil stew and he ate and drank and he got up and went away
thus eʹsau despised the birthright
13  aʹbram then went up out of egypt to the negʹeb he and his wife and all that he had together with lot
2  aʹbram was very rich in livestock silver and gold
3  he camped in one place after another as he traveled from the negʹeb to bethʹel until he arrived at the place where his tent had been between bethʹel and aʹi
4  to the place where he had previously built an altar
there aʹbram called on the name of jehovah
5  now lot who was traveling with aʹbram also owned sheep cattle and tents
6  so the land did not allow for all of them to stay in the same place their goods had become so many that they could no longer dwell together
7  as a result a quarrel arose between the herders of aʹbrams livestock and the herders of lots livestock
at that time the caʹnaanites and the perʹizzites were dwelling in the land
8  so aʹbram said to lot please there should be no quarreling between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen for we are brothers
9  is not the whole land available to you please separate from me
if you go to the left then i will go to the right but if you go to the right then i will go to the left
10  so lot raised his eyes and saw that the whole district of the jordan was a wellwatered region before jehovah destroyed sodʹom and gomorʹrah like the garden of jehovah like the land of egypt as far as zoʹar
11  then lot chose for himself the whole district of the jordan and lot moved his camp to the east
so they separated from each other
12  aʹbram lived in the land of caʹnaan but lot lived among the cities of the district
finally he set up his tent near sodʹom
13  now the men of sodʹom were wicked gross sinners against jehovah
14  jehovah said to aʹbram after lot had separated from him raise your eyes please and look from the place where you are to the north and south east and west
15  because all the land that you see i will give to you and your offspring as a lasting possession
16  and i will make your offspring like the dust particles of the earth so that if anyone could count the dust particles of the earth then your offspring could be counted
17  get up travel through the length and breadth of the land for to you i am going to give it
18  so aʹbram continued to live in tents
later he came and dwelled among the big trees of mamʹre which are in hebʹron and there he built an altar to jehovah
14  now in the days of amʹraphel king of shiʹnar arʹioch king of ellaʹsar chedorlaoʹmer king of eʹlam and tiʹdal king of goiʹim
2  these made war with beʹra king of sodʹom birʹsha king of gomorʹrah shiʹnab king of adʹmah shemeʹber king of zeboiʹim and the king of beʹla that is zoʹar
3  all of these joined forces at the valley of sidʹdim that is the salt sea
4  they had served chedorlaoʹmer for 12 years but they rebelled in the 13th year
5  so in the 14th year chedorlaoʹmer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the rephʹaim in ashʹterothkarnaʹim the zuʹzim in ham the eʹmim in shaʹvehkiriathaʹim
6  and the horʹites in their mountain of seʹir down to elpaʹran which is at the wilderness
7  then they turned back and came to enmishʹpat that is kaʹdesh and conquered the whole territory of the amalʹekites and also the amʹorites who were dwelling in hazʹazontaʹmar
8  at this point the king of sodʹom went on the march and also the king of gomorʹrah the king of adʹmah the king of zeboiʹim and the king of beʹla that is zoʹar and they drew up in battle formation against them in the valley of sidʹdim
9  against chedorlaoʹmer king of eʹlam tiʹdal king of goiʹim amʹraphel king of shiʹnar and arʹioch king of ellaʹsarfour kings against the five
10  now the valley of sidʹdim was full of bitumen pits and the kings of sodʹom and gomorʹrah tried to escape and fell into them and those who remained fled to the mountainous region
11  then the victors took all the goods of sodʹom and gomorʹrah and all their food and went on their way
12  they also took lot the son of aʹbrams brother who was dwelling in sodʹom as well as his goods and they continued on their way
13  after that a man who had escaped came and told aʹbram the hebrew
he was then dwelling among the big trees of mamʹre the amʹorite the brother of eshʹcol and aʹner
these men were allies of aʹbram
14  thus aʹbram heard that his relative had been taken captive
with that he mobilized his trained men 318 servants born in his household and went in pursuit up to dan
15  during the night he divided his forces and he and his servants attacked and defeated them
and he pursued them up to hoʹbah which is north of damascus
16  he recovered all the goods and he also recovered lot his relative his goods the women and the other people
17  after aʹbram returned from defeating chedorlaoʹmer and the kings who were with him the king of sodʹom went out to meet aʹbram at the valley of shaʹveh that is the valley of the king
18  and melchizʹedek king of saʹlem brought out bread and wine he was priest of the most high god
19  then he blessed him and said blessed be aʹbram by the most high godmaker of heaven and earth
20  and praised be the most high godwho has handed your oppressors over to you and aʹbram gave him a tenth of everything
21  after that the king of sodʹom said to aʹbram give me the people but take the goods for yourself
22  but aʹbram said to the king of sodʹom i raise my hand in an oath to jehovah the most high god maker of heaven and earth
23  that i will not take anything that is yours from a thread to a sandal lace so that you may not say i made aʹbram rich
24  i will take nothing except what the young men have already eaten
as for the share of the men who went with me aʹner eshʹcol and mamʹrelet them take their share
29  after that jacob resumed his journey and traveled on to the land of the people of the east
2  now he saw a well in the field and three droves of sheep lying down next to it because they usually watered the droves from that well
there was a large stone over the mouth of the well
3  when all the droves had been gathered there they rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well and they watered the flocks after which they returned the stone to its place over the mouth of the well
4  so jacob said to them my brothers what place are you from to which they said we are from haʹran
5  he said to them do you know laʹban the grandson of naʹhor to which they said we know him
6  at this he said to them is he well they replied he is well
and here is his daughter rachel coming with the sheep
7  then he said it is still the middle of the day
it is not the time for gathering the herds
water the sheep and then go feed them
8  to this they said we are not allowed to do so until all the droves are gathered and they roll the stone away from the mouth of the well
then we water the sheep
9  while he was yet speaking with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she was a shepherdess
10  when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laʹban his mothers brother and the sheep of laʹban jacob immediately approached and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of laʹban his mothers brother
11  then jacob kissed rachel and raised his voice and burst into tears
12  and jacob began to tell rachel that he was the relative of her father and that he was the son of rebekʹah
and she ran off and told her father
13  as soon as laʹban heard the report about jacob the son of his sister he ran to meet him
he embraced him and kissed him and brought him into his house
and he began to tell laʹban all these things
14  laʹban said to him you are indeed my bone and my flesh
so he stayed with him a full month
15  laʹban then said to jacob just because you are my relative should you serve me for nothing tell me what are your wages to be
16  now laʹban had two daughters
the name of the older was leʹah and the name of the younger rachel
17  but the eyes of leʹah had no luster whereas rachel had become a very attractive and beautiful woman
18  jacob had fallen in love with rachel so he said i am willing to serve you seven years for your younger daughter rachel
19  to this laʹban said it is better for me to give her to you than to give her to another man
keep dwelling with me
20  and jacob served seven years for rachel but in his eyes they were like just a few days because of his love for her
21  then jacob said to laʹban give over my wife because my days are up and let me have relations with her
22  with that laʹban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast
23  but during the evening he resorted to taking his daughter leʹah and bringing her to him that he might have relations with her
24  laʹban also gave his female servant zilʹpah to his daughter leʹah as a servant
25  in the morning jacob saw that it was leʹah so he said to laʹban what have you done to me was it not for rachel that i served you why have you tricked me
26  to this laʹban said it is not our custom here to give the younger woman before the firstborn
27  celebrate the week of this woman
after that you will also be given this other woman in exchange for serving me seven more years
28  jacob did so and celebrated the week of this woman after which he gave him his daughter rachel as a wife
29  besides laʹban gave his female servant bilʹhah to his daughter rachel as her servant
30  then jacob had relations also with rachel and he loved rachel more than leʹah and he served him for another seven years
31  when jehovah saw that leʹah was unloved he then enabled her to become pregnant but rachel was barren
32  so leʹah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and named him reuʹben for she said it is because jehovah has looked upon my affliction for now my husband will begin to love me
33  and she again became pregnant and gave birth to a son and then said it is because jehovah has listened in that i was unloved so he gave me this one also
then she named him simʹeon
34  and she became pregnant yet again and gave birth to a son and then said now this time my husband will join himself to me because i have borne him three sons
therefore he was named leʹvi
35  and she became pregnant once more and gave birth to a son and then said this time i will praise jehovah
she therefore named him judah
after that she stopped giving birth
40  after these things the chief cupbearer of the king of egypt and the chief baker sinned against their lord the king of egypt
2  so pharʹaoh grew indignant at his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker
3  and he committed them to the jail of the house of the chief of the guard to the place where joseph was a prisoner
4  then the chief of the guard assigned joseph to be with them and to take care of them and they remained in jail for some time
5  the cupbearer and the baker of the king of egypt who were confined in the prison each had a dream on the same night and each dream had its own interpretation
6  the next morning when joseph came in and saw them they looked dejected
7  so he asked the officers of pharʹaoh who were in custody with him in his masters house why are your faces gloomy today
8  at this they said to him we each had a dream but there is no interpreter with us
joseph said to them do not interpretations belong to god relate it to me please
9  so the chief cupbearer related his dream to joseph saying to him in my dream there was a vine before me
10  and on the vine there were three twigs and as it was sprouting shoots it blossomed and its clusters ripened into grapes
11  and pharʹaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and squeezed them out into pharʹaohs cup
after that i put the cup in pharʹaohs hand
12  then joseph said to him this is its interpretation the three twigs are three days
13  three days from now pharʹaoh will bring you out restoring you to your office and you will put pharʹaohs cup into his hand as you did before when you were his cupbearer
14  nevertheless you must remember me when things go well with you
please show me loyal love and mention me to pharʹaoh in order to get me out of this place
15  i was in fact kidnapped from the land of the hebrews and i have not done anything here for which they should put me in prison
16  when the chief baker saw that joseph had interpreted something good he said to him i too was in my dream and there were three baskets of white bread on my head
17  and in the top basket there were all sorts of baked goods for pharʹaoh and there were birds eating them out of the basket on top of my head
18  then joseph answered this is its interpretation the three baskets are three days
19  three days from now pharʹaoh will behead you and will hang you on a stake and the birds will eat your flesh from you
20  now the third day was pharʹaohs birthday and he made a feast for all his servants and he brought out both the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his servants
21  and he returned the chief cupbearer to his post of cupbearer and he continued to hand the cup to pharʹaoh
22  but he hanged the chief baker just as joseph had interpreted to them
23  however the chief cupbearer did not remember joseph he kept forgetting him
39  now joseph was taken down to egypt and an egyptian named potʹiphar a court official of pharʹaoh and chief of the guard bought him from the ishʹmaelites who had taken him down there
2  but jehovah was with joseph
as a result he became successful and was put over the house of his master the egyptian
3  and his master saw that jehovah was with him and that jehovah was making everything that he did successful
4  joseph kept finding favor in his eyes and he became his personal attendant
so he appointed him over his house and he put him in charge of all that was his
5  from the time he appointed him over his house and in charge of all that was his jehovah kept blessing the house of the egyptian because of joseph and jehovahs blessing came to be on all that he had in the house and in the field
6  he eventually left everything that was his in josephs care and he gave no thought to anything except the food he was eating
moreover joseph grew to be wellbuilt and handsome
7  now after these things the wife of his master began to cast her eyes on joseph and say lie down with me
8  but he refused and said to his masters wife here my master does not know what is with me in the house and he has entrusted everything he has into my care
9  there is no one greater in this house than i am and he has not withheld from me anything at all except you because you are his wife
so how could i commit this great badness and actually sin against god
10  so day after day she spoke to joseph but he never consented to lie with her or to remain with her
11  but on one of the days when he went into the house to do his work none of the household servants were in the house
12  then she grabbed hold of him by his garment and said lie down with me but he left his garment in her hand and fled outside
13  as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside
14  she began to cry out to the men of her house and to say to them look he brought to us this hebrew man to make us a laughingstock
he came to me to lie down with me but i began to cry out at the top of my voice
15  then as soon as he heard me raising my voice and screaming he left his garment beside me and fled outside
16  after that she laid his garment beside her until his master came to his house
17  then she told him the same thing saying the hebrew servant whom you brought to us came to me to make me a laughingstock
18  but as soon as i raised my voice and began to scream he left his garment beside me and fled outside
19  as soon as his master heard the words his wife spoke to him saying these are the things your servant did to me his anger blazed
20  so josephs master took him and gave him over to the prison the place where the prisoners of the king were kept under arrest and he remained there in the prison
21  but jehovah continued with joseph and kept showing loyal love to him and granting him favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison
22  so the chief officer of the prison put joseph in charge of all the prisoners in the prison and everything that they were doing there he was the one having it done
23  the chief officer of the prison was looking after absolutely nothing that was in josephs care for jehovah was with joseph and jehovah made whatever he did successful
19  the two angels arrived at sodʹom by evening and lot was sitting in the gate of sodʹom
when lot saw them he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the earth
2  and he said please my lords turn aside please into the house of your servant and stay overnight and have your feet washed
then you may get up early and travel on your way
to this they said no we will stay overnight in the public square
3  but he was so insistent with them that they went with him to his house
then he made a feast for them and he baked unleavened bread and they ate
4  before they could lie down to sleep the men of the citythe men of sodʹom from boy to old man all of themsurrounded the house in one mob
5  and they kept calling out to lot and saying to him where are the men who came in to you tonight bring them out to us so that we may have sex with them
6  then lot went out to them to the doorway and he shut the door behind him
7  he said please my brothers do not act wickedly
8  please here i have two daughters who have never had sexual relations with a man
please let me bring them out to you for you to do to them whatever seems good to you
but do not do anything to these men for they have come under the shelter of my roof
9  at this they said stand back and they added this lone foreigner came to live here and yet he dares to judge us now we are going to do worse to you than to them
and they crowded in on lot and moved forward to break down the door
10  so the men reached out their hands and brought lot into the house with them and they shut the door
11  but they struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness from the least to the greatest so that they wore themselves out trying to find the doorway
12  then the men said to lot do you have anyone else here sonsinlaw your sons your daughters and all your people in the city bring out of this place
13  for we are going to destroy this place because the outcry against them has indeed grown great before jehovah so that jehovah sent us to destroy the city
14  so lot went out and began to speak to his sonsinlaw who were to marry his daughters and he kept saying get up get out of this place because jehovah will destroy the city but to his sonsinlaw he seemed to be joking
15  as dawn was breaking the angels became urgent with lot saying get up take your wife and your two daughters who are here with you so that you will not be swept away in the error of the city
16  when he kept lingering then because of jehovahs compassion for him the men seized hold of his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters and they brought him out and stationed him outside the city
17  as soon as they had brought them to the outskirts he said escape for your life do not look behind you and do not stand still in any part of the district escape to the mountainous region so that you may not be swept away
18  then lot said to them not there please jehovah
19  please now your servant has found favor in your eyes and you are showing great kindness to me by preserving me alive but i am not able to flee to the mountainous region because i am afraid that disaster may overtake me and i will die
20  please now this town is nearby and i can flee there it is only a small place
may i please escape there it is only a small place
then i will survive
21  so he said to him very well i will also show you consideration by not overthrowing the town you speak of
22  hurry escape there because i cannot do anything until you arrive there that is why he named the town zoʹar
23  the sun had risen over the land when lot arrived at zoʹar
24  then jehovah made it rain sulfur and fire on sodʹom and gomorʹrahit came from jehovah from the heavens
25  so he overthrew these cities yes the entire district including all the inhabitants of the cities and the plants of the ground
26  but lots wife who was behind him began to look back and she became a pillar of salt
27  now abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before jehovah
28  when he looked down toward sodʹom and gomorʹrah and all the land of the district he saw quite a sight
there was dense smoke rising from the land like the dense smoke of a kiln
29  so when god destroyed the cities of the district god kept abraham in mind by sending lot out from the cities he overthrew the cities where lot had been dwelling
30  later lot went up from zoʹar with his two daughters and began living in the mountainous region because he was afraid to live in zoʹar
so he began living in a cave with his two daughters
31  and the firstborn said to the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the land to have relations with us according to the custom of the whole earth
32  come let us give our father wine to drink and let us lie down with him and preserve offspring from our father
33  so that night they kept giving their father wine to drink then the firstborn went in and lay down with her father but he did not know when she lay down and when she got up
34  then on the next day the firstborn said to the younger here i lay down with my father last night
let us give him wine to drink tonight also
then you go in and lie down with him and let us preserve offspring from our father
35  so that night also they repeatedly gave their father wine to drink then the younger went and lay down with him but he did not know when she lay down and when she got up
36  so both daughters of lot became pregnant by their father
37  the firstborn gave birth to a son and named him moʹab
he is the father of the moʹabites of today
38  the younger also gave birth to a son and she named him benamʹmi
he is the father of the amʹmonites of today
24  abraham was now old advanced in years and jehovah had blessed abraham in everything
2  abraham said to his servant the oldest one of his household who was managing all he had please put your hand under my thigh
3  and i will make you swear by jehovah the god of the heavens and the god of the earth that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the caʹnaanites among whom i am dwelling
4  you must go instead to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son for isaac
5  however the servant said to him what if the woman is not willing to come with me to this land must i then return your son to the land from which you came
6  at this abraham said to him see that you do not take my son there
7  jehovah the god of the heavens who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my relatives and who spoke with me and swore to me to your offspring i am going to give this land he will send his angel ahead of you and you will certainly take a wife for my son from there
8  but if the woman is unwilling to come with you you will be free from this oath
but you must not take my son there
9  with that the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter
10  so the servant took ten of his masters camels and departed taking along all sorts of good things from his master
then he went on his way to mesopotaʹmia to the city of naʹhor
11  he had the camels kneel down at a well of water outside the city
it was about evening the time when the women would go out to draw water
12  then he said jehovah the god of my master abraham please grant me success this day and show your loyal love to my master abraham
13  here i am standing at a spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water
14  may it happen that the young woman to whom i say please let down your water jar so that i may take a drink and who replies take a drink and i will also water your camels let this be the one you choose for your servant isaac and by this let me know that you have shown your loyal love to my master
15  even before he finished speaking rebekʹah who was the daughter of bethuʹel the son of milʹcah the wife of naʹhor abrahams brother came out with her water jar on her shoulder
16  now the young woman was very beautiful a virgin no man had had sexual relations with her
she went down to the spring filled her water jar and then came back up
17  at once the servant ran to meet her and said please give me a little sip of water from your jar
18  in turn she said drink my lord
with that she quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink
19  when she finished giving him a drink she said i will also draw water for your camels until they are done drinking
20  so she quickly emptied her jar into the drinking trough and ran again and again to the well to draw water and she kept drawing water for all his camels
21  the whole time the man silently stared at her in amazement wondering whether jehovah had made his trip successful or not
22  when the camels had finished drinking the man took out for her a gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets of gold weighing ten shekels
23  and he said please tell me whose daughter are you is there any room at your fathers house for us to spend the night
24  at that she said to him i am the daughter of bethuʹel the son of milʹcah whom she bore to naʹhor
25  and she added we have both straw and much fodder and also a place to spend the night
26  then the man bowed down and prostrated himself before jehovah
27  and said may jehovah be praised the god of my master abraham for he has not abandoned his loyal love and his faithfulness toward my master
jehovah has guided me to the house of the brothers of my master
28  and the young woman ran to tell her mothers household about these things
29  now rebekʹah had a brother whose name was laʹban
so laʹban ran to the man who was outside at the spring
30  when he saw the nose ring and the bracelets on the hands of his sister and heard the words of his sister rebekʹah who was saying this is the way the man spoke to me he came to meet the man who was still there standing by the camels at the spring
31  at once he said come you who are blessed by jehovah
why do you keep standing out here i have made the house ready and a place for the camels
32  with that the man came into the house and he unharnessed the camels and gave straw and fodder to the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him
33  however when something to eat was set before him he said i will not eat until i have told you what i have to say
so laʹban said speak
34  then he said i am abrahams servant
35  and jehovah has blessed my master very much and he has made him very wealthy by giving him sheep and cattle silver and gold male and female servants and camels and donkeys
36  further sarah the wife of my master bore a son to my master after she grew old and he will give him everything he has
37  so my master made me swear saying you must not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the caʹnaanites in whose land i am dwelling
38  no but you will go to the house of my father and to my family and you must take a wife for my son
39  but i said to my master what if the woman is unwilling to come with me
40  he said to me jehovah before whom i have walked will send his angel with you and will certainly give success to your journey and you must take a wife for my son from my family and from the house of my father
41  you will be released from your oath to me if you go to my family and they will not give her to you
this will release you from your oath
42  when i got to the spring today i said jehovah the god of my master abraham if you will make my journey successful
43  here i am standing at a spring
what must take place is that when a young woman comes out to draw water i will say please let me drink a little water from your jar
44  and she will say to me you take a drink and i will also draw water for your camels
let that woman be the one whom jehovah has chosen for the son of my master
45  before i was finished speaking in my heart there was rebekʹah coming out with her jar on her shoulder and she made her way down to the spring and began to draw water
then i said to her give me a drink please
46  so she quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said take a drink and i will also water your camels
then i took a drink and she also watered the camels
47  after that i asked her whose daughter are you to which she replied the daughter of bethuʹel the son of naʹhor whom milʹcah bore to him
so i put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her hands
48  and i bowed down and prostrated myself before jehovah and praised jehovah the god of my master abraham who had led me on the right path to take the daughter of the brother of my master for his son
49  and now tell me if you wish to show loyal love and faithfulness toward my master but if not tell me so that i may proceed one way or the other
50  then laʹban and bethuʹel answered this is from jehovah
we are not able to say yes or no to you
51  here is rebekʹah before you
take her and go and let her become a wife to the son of your master just as jehovah has spoken
52  when abrahams servant heard their words he at once bowed down on the ground before jehovah
53  and the servant began to bring out articles of silver and of gold and garments and to give them to rebekʹah and he gave valuable things to her brother and to her mother
54  after that he and the men with him ate and drank and they spent the night there
when he got up in the morning he said send me off to my master
55  to this her brother and her mother said let the young woman stay with us at least ten days
then she can go
56  but he said to them do not detain me seeing that jehovah has made my journey successful
send me off in order that i may go to my master
57  so they said let us call the young woman and inquire of her
58  they called rebekʹah and said to her will you go with this man she replied i am willing to go
59  so they sent off their sister rebekʹah and her nurse and abrahams servant and his men
60  and they blessed rebekʹah and said to her our sister may you become thousands times ten thousand and let your offspring take possession of the gate of those who hate them
61  then rebekʹah and her female attendants rose got on the camels and followed the man
so the servant took rebekʹah and went on his way
62  now isaac had come from the direction of beʹerlaʹhairoi for he was dwelling in the land of the negʹeb
63  and isaac was out walking in the field about nightfall to meditate
when he looked up why he saw that camels were coming
64  when rebekʹah looked up she caught sight of isaac and she quickly got down from the camel
65  then she asked the servant who is that man there walking in the field to meet us and the servant said it is my master
so she took her veil to cover herself
66  and the servant told isaac all the things he had done
67  after that isaac brought her into the tent of sarah his mother
thus he took rebekʹah as his wife and he fell in love with her and isaac found comfort after the loss of his mother
43  now the famine was severe in the land
2  so when they had finished eating the grain they had brought from egypt their father said to them return and buy a little food for us
3  then judah said to him the man clearly warned us you must not see my face again unless your brother is with you
4  if you send our brother with us we will go down and buy food for you
5  but if you do not send him we will not go down for the man said to us you must not see my face again unless your brother is with you
6  and israel asked why did you have to bring this trouble on me by telling the man that you had another brother
7  they replied the man directly inquired concerning us and our relatives saying is your father still alive do you have another brother and we told him these facts
how could we possibly know that he would say bring your brother down
8  judah then urged israel his father send the boy with me and let us go on our way so that we may live and not diewe and you and our children
9  i will be a guarantee for his safety
you may hold me responsible
if i fail to return him to you and present him to you i will have sinned against you for all time
10  but if we had not delayed we could have been there and back twice by now
11  so israel their father said to them if it must be so then do this take the finest products of the land in your bags and carry them down to the man as a gift a little balsam a little honey labdanum resinous bark pistachio nuts and almonds
12  take double the money with you and also take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your bags
maybe it was a mistake
13  take your brother and go return to the man
14  may god almighty grant you pity from the man so that he may release to you your other brother and benjamin
but as for me if i must be bereaved i will be bereaved
15  so the men took this gift and they took double the money in their hand and benjamin
then they rose and went on their way down to egypt and again stood before joseph
16  when joseph saw benjamin with them he at once said to the man who was over his house take the men to the house and slaughter animals and prepare the meal for the men are to eat with me at noon
17  immediately the man did just as joseph had said and he took them to josephs house
18  but the men became afraid when they were taken to josephs house and they began to say it is because of the money that was returned in our bags the last time that we are being brought here
now they will attack us and make us slaves and take our donkeys
19  so they approached the man who was over josephs house and spoke to him at the entrance of the house
20  they said pardon us my lord we did come down the first time to buy food
21  but when we arrived at our lodging place and began opening our bags why here was the money of each one in the mouth of his bag our money in full weight
so we would like to return it personally
22  and we have brought more money to buy food
we do not know who placed our money in our bags
23  then he said it is all right
do not be afraid
your god and the god of your father put treasure in your bags
your money came first to me
after that he brought out simʹeon to them
24  then the man brought them into josephs house and gave them water for washing their feet and he gave fodder for their donkeys
25  and they prepared the gift for josephs coming at noon for they had heard that they were going to eat a meal there
26  when joseph went into the house they brought their gift to him into the house and prostrated themselves to him to the ground
27  after this he inquired about their welfare and said how is your aged father of whom you have spoken is he still alive
28  to this they said your servant our father is well
he is still alive
then they bowed down and prostrated themselves
29  when he looked up and saw benjamin his brother the son of his mother he said is this your brother the youngest one of whom you have spoken to me he added may god show you his favor my son
30  joseph then hurried out because he was overcome with emotion for his brother and he looked for a place to weep
so he went into a private room and gave way to tears there
31  after that he washed his face and went out now in control of himself and he said serve the meal
32  they served him by himself and them by themselves and the egyptians with him ate by themselves for the egyptians could not eat a meal with the hebrews because that is a detestable thing to the egyptians
33  the brothers were seated before him the firstborn according to his right as firstborn and the youngest according to his youth and they kept looking at one another in amazement
34  he kept sending portions of food from his table to theirs but he increased benjamins portion five times the size of the portions of all the others
so they continued banqueting and drinking with him to the full
44  later he commanded the man who was over his house fill the bags of the men with as much food as they can carry and place the money of each one in the mouth of his bag
2  but you must place my cup the silver cup in the mouth of the bag of the youngest along with the money for his grain
so he did as joseph had instructed
3  in the morning when it had become light the men were sent away with their donkeys
4  they had not gone far from the city when joseph said to the man who was over his house get up chase after the men when you overtake them say to them why have you repaid bad for good
5  is not this what my master drinks from and uses to read omens expertly it is a wicked thing you have done
6  so he overtook them and spoke these words to them
7  but they said to him why does my lord say such a thing it is unthinkable that your servants would do anything like this
8  why the money that we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back to you from the land of caʹnaan
how then could we steal silver or gold from the house of your master
9  if it is found with one of your slaves let him die and the rest of us will also become slaves to my master
10  so he said let it be as you say the one with whom it is found will become my slave but the rest of you will be innocent
11  with that each one quickly lowered his bag to the ground and opened it
12  he searched carefully starting with the oldest and finishing with the youngest
finally the cup was found in benjamins bag
13  then they ripped their garments apart and each of them lifted his load back onto his donkey and returned to the city
14  when judah and his brothers went into josephs house he was still there and they fell to the ground before him
15  joseph said to them what is this deed that you have done did you not know that a man like me can expertly read omens
16  at this judah replied what can we say to my master what can we speak and how can we prove ourselves righteous the true god has found out the error of your slaves
we are now slaves to my master both we and the one in whose hand the cup was found
17  however he said it is unthinkable for me to do this the man in whose hand the cup was found is the one who will become a slave to me
as for the rest of you go up in peace to your father
18  judah now approached him and said i beg you my master please let your slave speak a word in my masters ears and do not become angry with your slave for you are like pharʹaoh himself
19  my master asked his slaves do you have a father or a brother
20  so we said to my master we do have an aged father and a child of his old age the youngest
but his brother is dead so he is the only remaining son of his mother and his father loves him
21  after that you said to your slaves bring him down to me so that i may see him
22  but we said to my master the boy is not able to leave his father
if he did leave him his father would certainly die
23  then you said to your slaves unless your youngest brother comes down with you you may not see my face anymore
24  so we went up to your slave my father and told him the words of my master
25  later our father said return and buy a little food for us
26  but we said we are not able to go down
if our youngest brother is with us we will go down for we cannot see the mans face unless our youngest brother is with us
27  then your slave my father said to us you well know that my wife bore but two sons to me
28  but one of them left me and i said he must surely have been torn to pieces and i have not seen him until now
29  if you were to take this one also out of my sight and a fatal accident were to befall him you would certainly bring down my gray hairs to the grave with calamity
30  and now if i return to your slave my father without the boy along with us since his own life is bound up with this ones life
31  then as soon as he sees that the boy is not there he will die and your slaves will indeed bring down the gray hairs of your slave our father to the grave in grief
32  your slave gave a guarantee to my father for the boy saying if i fail to bring him back to you then i will have sinned against my father forever
33  so now please let your slave stay instead of the boy as my masters slave in order that the boy may return with his brothers
34  how can i return to my father without the boy along with me i could not bear looking on when this calamity befalls my father
47  so joseph went and reported to pharʹaoh my father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they possess have come from the land of caʹnaan and they are in the land of goʹshen
2  he took five of his brothers and presented them to pharʹaoh
3  pharʹaoh said to his brothers what is your occupation they replied to pharʹaoh your servants are herders of sheep both we and our forefathers
4  then they said to pharʹaoh we have come to reside as foreigners in the land because there are no pastures for the flock of your servants for the famine is severe in the land of caʹnaan
so please let your servants dwell in the land of goʹshen
5  at that pharʹaoh said to joseph your father and your brothers have come here to you
6  the land of egypt is at your disposal
have your father and your brothers dwell in the very best part of the land
let them dwell in the land of goʹshen and if you know of any capable men among them put them in charge of my livestock
7  then joseph brought in jacob his father and presented him to pharʹaoh and jacob blessed pharʹaoh
8  pharʹaoh asked jacob how old are you
9  jacob said to pharʹaoh the years of my wanderings are 130
few and distressing the years of my life have been and they are not as long as the years of the lives of my forefathers during their wanderings
10  after that jacob blessed pharʹaoh and went out from before him
11  so joseph settled his father and his brothers and he gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the very best part of the land in the land of ramʹeses just as pharʹaoh had commanded
12  and joseph kept supplying his father and his brothers and the entire household of his father with food according to the number of their children
13  now there was no food in all the land because the famine was very severe and the land of egypt and the land of caʹnaan became exhausted as a result of the famine
14  joseph was collecting all the money that was to be found in the land of egypt and in the land of caʹnaan for the grain that people were buying and joseph kept bringing the money into pharʹaohs house
15  in time the money from the land of egypt and the land of caʹnaan was spent and all the egyptians began coming to joseph saying give us food why should we die before your very eyes because our money has run out
16  then joseph said if your money has run out hand over your livestock and i will give you food in exchange for your livestock
17  so they began bringing their livestock to joseph and joseph kept giving them food in exchange for their horses the livestock of the flock and of the herd and the donkeys and he kept providing them with food in exchange for all their livestock during that year
18  when that year came to its close they began coming to him the next year and saying we will not hide from my lord that the money and the stock of domestic animals have already been given to my lord
we have nothing left for my lord but our bodies and our land
19  why should we die before your eyes both we and our land buy us and our land in exchange for food and we together with our land will become slaves to pharʹaoh
give us seed so that we may live and not die and that our land may not become desolate
20  joseph then bought all the land of the egyptians for pharʹaoh because every egyptian sold his field for the famine was very severe and the land became pharʹaohs
21  then he moved the people into cities from one end of the territory of egypt to its other end
22  only the land of the priests he did not buy because the rations for the priests were from pharʹaoh and they lived on their rations that pharʹaoh gave them
that is why they did not sell their land
23  then joseph said to the people see i have today bought you and your land for pharʹaoh
here is seed for you and you must sow the land with it
24  when it produces give a fifth to pharʹaoh but four parts will be yours as seed for the field and as food for you and for those in your houses and for your children to eat
25  so they said you have preserved our lives
let us find favor in the eyes of my lord and we will become slaves to pharʹaoh
26  then joseph made it a decree which is valid until today over the land of egypt that a fifth belongs to pharʹaoh
it was only the land of the priests that did not become pharʹaohs
27  israel continued to dwell in the land of egypt in the land of goʹshen and they settled in it and were fruitful and increased greatly
28  and jacob lived on in the land of egypt for 17 years so that the days of jacobs life came to be 147 years
29  the time was approaching for israel to die so he called his son joseph and said if now i have found favor in your eyes place your hand please under my thigh and show loyal love and faithfulness to me
please do not bury me in egypt
30  when i die you must carry me out of egypt and bury me in the grave of my forefathers
accordingly he said i will do just as you say
31  then he said swear to me
so he swore to him
at that israel bowed down at the head of his bed
48  after these things joseph was told look your father is getting weak
at that he took his two sons manasʹseh and eʹphraim with him
2  then jacob was told here your son joseph has come to you
so israel gathered his strength and sat up on his bed
3  and jacob said to joseph god almighty appeared to me at luz in the land of caʹnaan and blessed me
4  and he said to me i am making you fruitful and i will make you many and i will transform you into a congregation of peoples and i will give this land to your offspring after you as a lasting possession
5  now your two sons who were born to you in the land of egypt before i came to you in egypt are mine
eʹphraim and manasʹseh will become mine just as reuʹben and simʹeon are mine
6  but the children born to you after them will become yours
they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance
7  as for me when i was coming from padʹdan rachel died alongside me in the land of caʹnaan while there was yet a good stretch of land before coming to ephʹrath
so i buried her there on the way to ephʹrath that is bethʹlehem
8  then israel saw josephs sons and asked who are these
9  so joseph said to his father they are my sons whom god has given me in this place
at this he said bring them to me please so that i may bless them
10  now the eyes of israel were failing from age and he was unable to see
so joseph brought them close to him and he kissed them and embraced them
11  israel said to joseph i never imagined i would see your face but here god has also let me see your offspring
12  joseph then removed them from israels knees and he bowed down with his face to the ground
13  joseph now took the two of them eʹphraim with his right hand to israels left and manasʹseh with his left hand to israels right and brought them close to him
14  however israel put out his right hand and placed it on eʹphraims head although he was the younger and he placed his left hand on manasʹsehs head
he purposely laid his hands this way since manasʹseh was the firstborn
15  then he blessed joseph and said the true god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walkedthe true god who has been shepherding me during all my life until this day
16  the angel who has been recovering me from all calamity bless the boys
let my name be called upon them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaaclet them increase to a multitude in the earth
17  when joseph saw that his father kept his right hand placed on eʹphraims head it was displeasing to him so he tried to take hold of his fathers hand to move it from eʹphraims head to manasʹsehs head
18  joseph said to his father not so my father because this is the firstborn
put your right hand on his head
19  but his father kept refusing and said i know it my son i know it
he too will become a people and he too will become great
nevertheless his younger brother will become greater than he will and his offspring will become the full equivalent of nations
20  so he continued to bless them on that day saying let israel mention you when they pronounce blessings sayingmay god make you like eʹphraim and like manasʹseh
thus he kept putting eʹphraim before manasʹseh
21  then israel said to joseph look i am dying but god will certainly continue with you and return you to the land of your forefathers
22  as for me i do give you one portion of land more than to your brothers which i took from the hand of the amʹorites with my sword and my bow

7  for their goods had become too many for them to dwell together and the land where they were residing was not able to sustain them because of their herds
8  so eʹsau took up dwelling in the mountainous region of seʹir
eʹsau is eʹdom
9  and this is the history of eʹsau the father of eʹdom in the mountainous region of seʹir
10  these are the names of the sons of eʹsau elʹiphaz the son of aʹdah eʹsaus wife reuʹel the son of basʹemath eʹsaus wife

41  at the end of two full years pharʹaoh dreamed that he was standing by the nile river
2  and there coming up from the river were seven finelooking fat cows and they were feeding on the nile grass
3  there were seven other cows that looked ugly and thin coming up after them from the nile and they stood alongside the fat cows by the bank of the nile
4  then the ugly thin cows began to eat up the seven finelooking fat cows
at this pharʹaoh woke up
5  then he went back to sleep and had a second dream
there were seven ears of grain coming up on one stalk full and choice
6  and growing up after them were seven ears of grain that were thin and scorched by the east wind
7  and the thin ears of grain began to swallow up the seven full and choice ears of grain
at this pharʹaoh woke up and realized that it was a dream
8  but in the morning his spirit became agitated
so he sent for all the magicpracticing priests of egypt and all her wise men
pharʹaoh related his dreams to them but there was no one who could interpret them for pharʹaoh
9  at that the chief cupbearer spoke with pharʹaoh saying i am confessing my sins today
10  pharʹaoh was indignant at his servants
so he committed me to the jail of the house of the chief of the guard both me and the chief baker
11  after that we each had a dream on the same night
he and i each had a dream with its own interpretation
12  and there with us was a young hebrew man a servant of the chief of the guard
when we related them to him he interpreted for us the meaning of each dream
13  it happened exactly as he had interpreted to us
i was restored to my office but the other man was hanged
14  so pharʹaoh sent for joseph and they brought him quickly from the prison
he shaved and changed his clothes and went in to pharʹaoh
15  then pharʹaoh said to joseph i had a dream but there is no one to interpret it
now i have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and interpret it
16  at this joseph answered pharʹaoh i need not be considered god will speak concerning pharʹaohs welfare
17  pharʹaoh went on to say to joseph in my dream i was standing on the bank of the nile river
18  and there coming up from the nile were seven finelooking fat cows and they began to feed on the nile grass
19  and there were seven other cows coming up after them poor and very badlooking and thin
i have never seen such badlooking cows in all the land of egypt
20  and the skinny bad cows began to eat up the first seven fat cows
21  but when they had consumed them no one could have known that they had done so since their appearance was just as bad as at the start
at that i woke up
22  after that i saw in my dream seven ears of grain coming up on one stalk full and choice
23  growing up after them were seven ears of shriveled grain thin and scorched by the east wind
24  then the thin ears of grain began to swallow up the seven choice ears of grain
so i told it to the magicpracticing priests but there was no one who could explain it to me
25  then joseph said to pharʹaoh the dreams of pharʹaoh are one and the same
the true god has told to pharʹaoh what he will do
26  the seven good cows are seven years
likewise the seven good ears of grain are seven years
the dreams are one and the same
27  the seven skinny and bad cows that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears of grain scorched by the east wind will prove to be seven years of famine
28  this is just as i told to pharʹaoh the true god has caused pharʹaoh to see what he will do
29  there are to be seven years of great abundance in all the land of egypt
30  but seven years of famine will certainly arise after them and all the abundance in the land of egypt will certainly be forgotten and the famine will exhaust the land
31  and the previous abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine afterward for it will be very severe
32  the dream was given twice to pharʹaoh because the matter has been firmly established by the true god and the true god will soon carry it out
33  so now let pharʹaoh look for a man who is discreet and wise and place him over the land of egypt
34  let pharʹaoh take action and appoint overseers in the land and he should collect one fifth of the produce of egypt during the seven years of abundance
35  and let them collect all the food during these coming good years and let them stockpile grain under pharʹaohs authority as food to be stored in the cities and safeguarded there
36  the food should serve as a supply for the land for the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of egypt so that the land may not perish in the famine
37  this proposal seemed good to pharʹaoh and all his servants
38  so pharʹaoh said to his servants can another man be found like this one in whom there is the spirit of god
39  pharʹaoh then said to joseph since god has caused you to know all of this there is no one as discreet and wise as you
40  you will personally be over my house and all my people will obey you implicitly
only in my role as king will i be greater than you
41  and pharʹaoh added to joseph see i am putting you over all the land of egypt
42  then pharʹaoh removed his signet ring from his own hand and put it on josephs hand and clothed him with garments of fine linen and placed a necklace of gold around his neck
43  moreover he had him ride in the second chariot of honor that he had and they would call out ahead of him avrékh thus he put him over all the land of egypt
44  pharʹaoh further said to joseph i am pharʹaoh but without your authorization no man may do a single thing in all the land of egypt
45  after that pharʹaoh gave joseph the name zaphʹenathpaneʹah and gave him asʹenath the daughter of potiʹphera the priest of on as a wife
and joseph began to oversee the land of egypt
46  joseph was 30 years old when he stood before pharʹaoh king of egypt
then joseph went out from before pharʹaoh and traveled throughout all the land of egypt
47  and during the seven years of abundance the land went on producing plentifully
48  and he kept collecting all the food of the seven years from the land of egypt and he would stockpile the food in the cities
in each city he would store the food from the fields around it
49  joseph continued stockpiling grain in very great quantity like the sand of the sea until finally they gave up measuring it because it could not be measured
50  before the year of the famine arrived two sons were born to joseph whom asʹenath the daughter of potiʹphera the priest of on bore to him
51  joseph named the firstborn manasʹseh for he said god has made me forget all my trouble and all the house of my father
52  and he named the second one eʹphraim for he said god has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction
53  then the seven years of abundance in the land of egypt ended
54  and the seven years of famine began just as joseph had said
the famine developed in all the lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread
55  eventually all the land of egypt suffered from the famine and the people began to cry to pharʹaoh for bread
then pharʹaoh said to all the egyptians go to joseph and do whatever he tells you
56  the famine continued over all the surface of the earth
then joseph began to open up all the granaries that were among them and to sell to the egyptians as the famine had a strong grip on the land of egypt
57  moreover people of all the earth came to egypt to buy from joseph because the famine had a strong grip on all the earth
15  after this the word of jehovah came to aʹbram in a vision saying do not fear aʹbram
i am a shield for you
your reward will be very great
2  aʹbram replied sovereign lord jehovah what will you give me seeing that i continue childless and the one who will inherit my house is a man of damascus elieʹzer
3  aʹbram added you have given me no offspring and a member of my household is succeeding me as heir
4  but look jehovahs word in reply to him was this man will not succeed you as heir but your own son will succeed you as heir
5  he now brought him outside and said look up please to the heavens and count the stars if you are able to do so
then he said to him so your offspring will become
6  and he put faith in jehovah and he counted it to him as righteousness
7  then he added i am jehovah who brought you out of ur of the chaldeʹans to give you this land as your possession
8  to this he said sovereign lord jehovah how will i know that i will take possession of it
9  he replied to him take for me a threeyearold heifer a threeyearold female goat a threeyearold ram a turtledove and a young pigeon
10  so he took all of these and cut them in two and put each part opposite the other but he did not cut up the birds
11  then the birds of prey began to descend on the carcasses but aʹbram kept driving them away
12  when the sun was about to set a deep sleep fell upon aʹbram and a great and frightening darkness descended on him
13  then he said to aʹbram know for certain that your offspring will be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people there will enslave them and afflict them for 400 years
14  but i will judge the nation they will serve and after that they will go out with many goods
15  as for you you will go to your forefathers in peace you will be buried at a good old age
16  but they will return here in the fourth generation because the error of the amʹorites has not yet reached its full measure
17  when the sun had set and it had become very dark a smoking furnace appeared and a fiery torch passed between the pieces
18  on that day jehovah made with aʹbram a covenant saying to your offspring i will give this land from the river of egypt to the great river the river euphraʹtes
19  the land of the kenʹites the kenʹizzites the kadʹmonites
20  the hitʹtites the perʹizzites the rephʹaim
21  the amʹorites the caʹnaanites the girʹgashites and the jebʹusites
20  now abraham moved his camp from there to the land of the negʹeb and began dwelling between kaʹdesh and shur
while he was residing at geʹrar
2  abraham repeated concerning his wife sarah she is my sister
so abimʹelech king of geʹrar sent for sarah and took her
3  afterward god came by night to abimʹelech in a dream and said to him here you are as good as dead because of the woman whom you have taken since she is married and belongs to another man
4  however abimʹelech had not gone near her
so he said jehovah will you kill a nation that is really innocent
5  did he not say to me she is my sister and did she too not say he is my brother i did this with an honest heart and innocent hands
6  then the true god said to him in the dream i know that you did this with an honest heart so i held you back from sinning against me
that is why i did not allow you to touch her
7  now return the mans wife for he is a prophet and he will make supplication for you and you will keep living
but if you are not returning her know that you will surely die you and all who are yours
8  abimʹelech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things and they became very frightened
9  then abimʹelech called abraham and said to him what have you done to us what sin have i committed against you that you would bring upon me and my kingdom such a great sin what you have done to me was not right
10  and abimʹelech went on to say to abraham what were your intentions when you did this thing
11  abraham said it was because i said to myself surely there is no fear of god in this place and they will kill me because of my wife
12  and besides she really is my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
13  so when god caused me to wander from the house of my father i said to her let this be how you show loyal love to me everywhere we go say of me he is my brother
14  abimʹelech then took sheep and cattle and male and female servants and gave them to abraham and he returned his wife sarah to him
15  abimʹelech also said here my land is available to you
dwell wherever you please
16  and to sarah he said here i give 1000 pieces of silver to your brother
it is a sign of your innocence to all who are with you and before everybody and you are cleared of reproach
17  and abraham began to make supplication to the true god and god healed abimʹelech and his wife and his slave girls and they began having children
18  for jehovah had made all the women of the house of abimʹelech barren because of sarah abrahams wife
1  in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
2  now the earth was formless and desolate and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep and gods active force was moving about over the surface of the waters
3  and god said let there be light
then there was light
4  after that god saw that the light was good and god began to divide the light from the darkness
5  god called the light day but the darkness he called night
and there was evening and there was morning a first day
6  then god said let there be an expanse between the waters and let there be a division between the waters and the waters
7  then god went on to make the expanse and divided the waters beneath the expanse from the waters above the expanse
and it was so
8  god called the expanse heaven
and there was evening and there was morning a second day
9  then god said let the waters under the heavens be collected together into one place and let the dry land appear
and it was so
10  god called the dry land earth but the collecting of the waters he called seas
and god saw that it was good
11  then god said let the earth cause grass to sprout seedbearing plants and fruit trees according to their kinds yielding fruit along with seed on the earth
and it was so
12  and the earth began to produce grass seedbearing plants and trees yielding fruit along with seed according to their kinds
then god saw that it was good
13  and there was evening and there was morning a third day
14  then god said let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night and they will serve as signs for seasons and for days and years
15  they will serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth
and it was so
16  and god went on to make the two great luminaries the greater luminary for dominating the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night and also the stars
17  thus god put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth
18  and to dominate by day and by night and to make a division between the light and the darkness
then god saw that it was good
19  and there was evening and there was morning a fourth day
20  then god said let the waters swarm with living creatures and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens
21  and god created the great sea creatures and all living creatures that move and swarm in the waters according to their kinds and every winged flying creature according to its kind
and god saw that it was good
22  with that god blessed them saying be fruitful and become many and fill the waters of the sea and let the flying creatures become many in the earth
23  and there was evening and there was morning a fifth day
24  then god said let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds domestic animals and creeping animals and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds
and it was so
25  and god went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds and the domestic animals according to their kinds and all the creeping animals of the ground according to their kinds
and god saw that it was good
26  then god said let us make man in our image according to our likeness and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth
27  and god went on to create the man in his image in gods image he created him male and female he created them
28  further god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and become many fill the earth and subdue it and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth
29  then god said here i have given to you every seedbearing plant that is on the entire earth and every tree with seedbearing fruit
let them serve as food for you
30  and to every wild animal of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving on the earth in which there is life i have given all green vegetation for food
and it was so
31  after that god saw everything he had made and look it was very good
and there was evening and there was morning a sixth day
2  thus the heavens and the earth and everything in them were completed
2  and by the seventh day god had completed the work that he had been doing and he began to rest on the seventh day from all his work that he had been doing
3  and god went on to bless the seventh day and to declare it sacred for on it god has been resting from all the work that he has created all that he purposed to make
4  this is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time they were created in the day that jehovah god made earth and heaven
5  no bush of the field was yet on the earth and no vegetation of the field had begun sprouting because jehovah god had not made it rain on the earth and there was no man to cultivate the ground
6  but a mist would go up from the earth and it watered the entire surface of the ground
7  and jehovah god went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living person
8  further jehovah god planted a garden in eʹden toward the east and there he put the man whom he had formed
9  thus jehovah god made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad
10  now there was a river flowing out of eʹden to water the garden and from there it divided into four rivers
11  the name of the first is piʹshon it is the one encircling the entire land of havʹilah where there is gold
12  the gold of that land is good
bdellium gum and onyx stone are also there
13  the name of the second river is giʹhon it is the one encircling the entire land of cush
14  the name of the third river is hidʹdekel it is the one going to the east of assyrʹia
and the fourth river is the euphraʹtes
15  jehovah god took the man and settled him in the garden of eʹden to cultivate it and to take care of it
16  jehovah god also gave this command to the man from every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction
17  but as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die
18  then jehovah god said it is not good for the man to continue to be alone
i am going to make a helper for him as a complement of him
19  now jehovah god had been forming from the ground every wild animal of the field and every flying creature of the heavens and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one and whatever the man would call each living creature that became its name
20  so the man named all the domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal of the field but for man there was no helper as a complement of him
21  so jehovah god caused the man to fall into a deep sleep and while he was sleeping he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place
22  and jehovah god built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and he brought her to the man
23  then the man said this is at last bone of my bonesand flesh of my flesh
this one will be called womanbecause from man she was taken
24  that is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife and they will become one flesh
25  and both of them continued to be naked the man and his wife yet they were not ashamed
3  now the serpent was the most cautious of all the wild animals of the field that jehovah god had made
so it said to the woman did god really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden
2  at this the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
3  but god has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden you must not eat from it no you must not touch it otherwise you will die
4  at this the serpent said to the woman you certainly will not die
5  for god knows that in the very day you eat from it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and bad
6  consequently the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something desirable to the eyes yes the tree was pleasing to look at
so she began taking of its fruit and eating it
afterward she also gave some to her husband when he was with her and he began eating it
7  then the eyes of both of them were opened and they realized that they were naked
so they sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves
8  later they heard the voice of jehovah god as he was walking in the garden about the breezy part of the day and the man and his wife hid from the face of jehovah god among the trees of the garden
9  and jehovah god kept calling to the man and saying to him where are you
10  finally he said i heard your voice in the garden but i was afraid because i was naked so i hid myself
11  at that he said who told you that you were naked have you eaten from the tree from which i commanded you not to eat
12  the man said the woman whom you gave to be with me she gave me fruit from the tree so i ate
13  jehovah god then said to the woman what is this you have done the woman replied the serpent deceived me so i ate
14  then jehovah god said to the serpent because you have done this you are the cursed one out of all the domestic animals and out of all the wild animals of the field
on your belly you will go and you will eat dust all the days of your life
15  and i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring
he will crush your head and you will strike him in the heel
16  to the woman he said i will greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy in pain you will give birth to children and your longing will be for your husband and he will dominate you
17  and to adam he said because you listened to your wifes voice and ate from the tree concerning which i gave you this command you must not eat from it cursed is the ground on your account
in pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life
18  it will grow thorns and thistles for you and you must eat the vegetation of the field
19  in the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground for out of it you were taken
for dust you are and to dust you will return
20  after this adam named his wife eve because she was to become the mother of everyone living
21  and jehovah god made long garments from skins for adam and for his wife to clothe them
22  jehovah god then said here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad
now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever
23  with that jehovah god expelled him from the garden of eʹden to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken
24  so he drove the man out and he posted at the east of the garden of eʹden the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning continuously to guard the way to the tree of life
33  now jacob raised his eyes and saw eʹsau coming and 400 men were with him
so he divided the children among leʹah rachel and the two female servants
2  he put the female servants and their children in front leʹah and her children after them and rachel and joseph behind them
3  then he himself went ahead of them and bowed down to the earth seven times as he came near to his brother
4  but eʹsau ran to meet him and he embraced him and kissed him and they burst into tears
5  when he raised his eyes and saw the women and the children he said who are these with you to which he said the children with whom god has favored your servant
6  at that the female servants came forward with their children and bowed down
7  and leʹah too came forward with her children and they bowed down
then joseph came forward with rachel and they bowed down
8  eʹsau said what is the purpose of all this camp of travelers that i have met he replied in order to find favor in the eyes of my lord
9  then eʹsau said i have a great many possessions my brother
keep what is yours
10  however jacob said no please
if i have found favor in your eyes you must take my gift from my hand because i brought it so that i could see your face
and i have seen your face as though seeing gods face in that you received me with pleasure
11  take please the gift conveying my blessing that was brought to you for god has favored me and i have everything i need
and he continued to urge him so that he took it
12  later eʹsau said let us move out and go and let me go in advance of you
13  but he said to him my lord is aware that the children are delicate and that in my care are sheep and cattle nursing their young
if they are driven too quickly for one day then the whole flock will die
14  let my lord please go on ahead of his servant but i will continue the journey more slowly at the pace of my livestock and of the children until i come to my lord at seʹir
15  then eʹsau said please let me leave some of my people with you
to this he said why do this just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord
16  so that day eʹsau went on his way back to seʹir
17  and jacob journeyed to sucʹcoth and he built a house for himself and he made shelters for his herd
that was why he named the place sucʹcoth
18  after journeying from padʹdanaʹram jacob arrived safely at the city of sheʹchem in the land of caʹnaan and he set up his camp near the city
19  then he acquired a portion of the field where he pitched his tent from the sons of haʹmor the father of sheʹchem for 100 pieces of money
20  there he set up an altar and called it god the god of israel
12  and jehovah said to aʹbram go out from your land and away from your relatives and from the house of your father to the land that i will show you
2  i will make you a great nation and i will bless you and i will make your name great and you will become a blessing
3  i will bless those who bless you and i will curse him who calls down evil on you and all the families of the ground will certainly be blessed by means of you
4  so aʹbram went just as jehovah had told him and lot went with him
aʹbram was 75 years old when he left haʹran
5  aʹbram took his wife sarʹai and lot the son of his brother and all the goods that they had accumulated and the people whom they had acquired in haʹran and they set out for the land of caʹnaan
when they reached the land of caʹnaan
6  aʹbram traveled through the land as far as the site of sheʹchem near the big trees of moʹreh
at that time the caʹnaanites were in the land
7  jehovah then appeared to aʹbram and said to your offspring i am going to give this land
so he built an altar there to jehovah who had appeared to him
8  later he moved from there to the mountainous region east of bethʹel and pitched his tent with bethʹel on the west and aʹi on the east
there he built an altar to jehovah and began to call on the name of jehovah
9  afterward aʹbram broke camp and journeyed toward the negʹeb moving his camp from one place to another
10  now a famine arose in the land and aʹbram went down toward egypt to reside there for a while because the famine in the land was severe
11  as he was about to enter egypt he said to his wife sarʹai please listen i know what a beautiful woman you are
12  so when the egyptians see you they will surely say this is his wife
then they will kill me but keep you alive
13  please say you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you and my life will be spared
14  as soon as aʹbram entered egypt the egyptians noticed that the woman was very beautiful
15  and the princes of pharʹaoh also saw her and they began praising her to pharʹaoh so that the woman was taken to the house of pharʹaoh
16  he treated aʹbram well because of her and he acquired sheep cattle male and female donkeys male and female servants and camels
17  then jehovah struck pharʹaoh and his household with severe plagues because of sarʹai aʹbrams wife
18  so pharʹaoh called aʹbram and said what is this you have done to me why did you not tell me that she was your wife
19  why did you say she is my sister so that i was about to take her as my wife here is your wife
take her and go
20  so pharʹaoh gave his men orders concerning him and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had
