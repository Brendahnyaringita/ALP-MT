1  the word of jehovah that came to zephaniʹah son of cushʹi son of gedaliʹah son of amariʹah son of hezekiʹah in the days of josiʹah son of aʹmon the king of judah
2  i will completely sweep away everything from the surface of the ground declares jehovah
3  i will sweep away man and beast
i will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the seaand the stumbling blocks along with the wicked onesand i will remove mankind from the surface of the ground declares jehovah
4  i will stretch out my hand against judahand against all the inhabitants of jerusalemand i will wipe out from this place every vestige of baʹalthe name of the foreigngod priests along with the priests
5  and those who bow down on the rooftops to the army of the heavensand those who bow down and pledge loyalty to jehovahwhile pledging loyalty to malʹcam
6  and those who turn away from following jehovahand who do not seek jehovah or inquire of him
7  be silent before the sovereign lord jehovah for the day of jehovah is near
jehovah has prepared a sacrifice he has sanctified those he invited
8  on the day of jehovahs sacrifice i will call to account the princesthe sons of the king and all those wearing foreign clothing
9  i will call to account everyone who climbs onto the platform on that daythose who fill their masters house with violence and deception
10  on that day declares jehovahthere will be the sound of an outcry from the fish gatea wailing from the second quarter of the cityand a loud crash from the hills
11  wail you inhabitants of makʹteshfor all the tradesmen have been done away withall those weighing out silver have been destroyed
12  at that time i will carefully search jerusalem with lampsand i will call to account the complacent ones who say in their heartjehovah will not do good and he will not do bad
13  their wealth will be plundered and their houses will be devastated
they will build houses but they will not occupy themand they will plant vineyards but they will not drink wine from them
14  the great day of jehovah is near it is near and it is approaching very quickly the sound of the day of jehovah is bitter
there a warrior cries out
15  that day is a day of furya day of distress and anguisha day of storm and desolationa day of darkness and glooma day of clouds and thick gloom
16  a day of the horn and of the battle cryagainst the fortified cities and against the high corner towers
17  i will cause distress to mankindand they will walk like blind menbecause it is against jehovah they have sinned
their blood will be poured out like dustand their flesh like the dung
18  neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the day of jehovahs furyfor by the fire of his zeal the whole earth will be consumedbecause he will make an extermination indeed a terrible one of all the inhabitants of the earth
2  gather together yes gather yourselveso nation that feels no shame
2  before the decree takes effectbefore the day passes by like chaffbefore the burning anger of jehovah comes upon youbefore the day of jehovahs anger comes upon you
3  seek jehovah all you meek ones of the earthwho observe his righteous decrees
seek righteousness seek meekness
probably you will be concealed on the day of jehovahs anger
4  for gazʹa will be an abandoned cityand ashʹkelon will be desolated
ashʹdod will be driven away in broad daylightand ekʹron will be uprooted
5  woe to those who inhabit the seacoast the nation of cherʹethites the word of jehovah is against you
o caʹnaan land of the philisʹtines i will destroy youso that there will be no inhabitant left
6  and the seacoast will become pasture groundswith wells for shepherds and stone pens for sheep
7  it will become a region for the remaining ones of the house of judahthere they will feed
in the houses of ashʹkelon they will lie down in the evening
for jehovah their god will turn his attention to themand he will gather back their captives
8  i have heard the reproach by moʹab and the insults of the amʹmoniteswho have taunted my people and made boasts against their territory
9  therefore as surely as i am alive declares jehovah of armies the god of israelmoʹab will become just like sodʹomand the amʹmonites like gomorʹraha place of nettles a salt pit and a permanent wasteland
the remaining ones of my people will plunder themand the remnant of my nation will dispossess them
10  this is what they will have instead of their pridebecause they taunted and exalted themselves against the people of jehovah of armies
11  jehovah will be aweinspiring against themfor he will bring to nothing all the gods of the earthand all the islands of the nations will bow down to himeach one from its place
12  you ethioʹpians will also be slain by my sword
13  he will stretch out his hand toward the north and destroy assyrʹiaand he will make ninʹeveh desolate as dry as a desert
14  herds will lie down within her all sorts of wild animals
both pelican and porcupine will spend the night among her pillar capitals
a voice will sing in the window
there will be devastation at the thresholdfor he will expose the cedar panels
15  this is the proud city that was sitting in securitythat was saying in her heart i am the one and there is nobody else
how she has become an object of horrora place for the wild animals to lie down everyone passing by her will whistle and shake his fist
3  woe to the rebellious the polluted the oppressive city
2  she has obeyed no voice she has accepted no discipline
in jehovah she has not trusted she has not drawn near to her god
3  her princes within her are roaring lions
her judges are wolves in the nightthey do not leave even a bone to gnaw until morning
4  her prophets are insolent treacherous men
her priests defile what is holythey do violence to the law
5  jehovah is righteous in her midst he does no wrong
morning by morning he makes known his judgmentsas unfailing as the daylight
but the unrighteous one knows no shame
6  i destroyed nations their corner towers were left desolate
i devastated their streets so that no one was passing through
their cities were left in ruins without a man without an inhabitant
7  i said surely you will fear me and accept discipline so that her dwelling place might not be destroyedi must call her to account for all these things
but they were all the more eager to act corruptly
8  so keep yourselves in expectation of me declares jehovahuntil the day when i rise up to take plunderfor my judicial decision is to gather nations to assemble kingdomsto pour out on them my indignation all my burning angerfor by the fire of my zeal the whole earth will be consumed
9  for then i will change the language of the peoples to a pure languageso that all of them may call on the name of jehovahto serve him shoulder to shoulder
10  from the region of the rivers of ethioʹpiathose entreating me the daughter of my scattered ones will bring a gift to me
11  on that day you will not be put to shamebecause of all your deeds with which you rebelled against mefor then i will remove the haughty boasters from among youand you will never again be haughty in my holy mountain
12  i will allow a humble and lowly people to remain in your midstand they will take refuge in the name of jehovah
13  those remaining of israel will practice no unrighteousnessthey will not speak a lie nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouthsthey will feed and lie down and no one will make them afraid
14  shout joyfully o daughter of zion shout in triumph o israel be joyful and rejoice with all your heart o daughter of jerusalem
15  jehovah has removed the judgments against you
he has turned away your enemy
the king of israel jehovah is in your midst
you will fear calamity no more
16  on that day it will be said to jerusalem do not be afraid o zion
do not let your hands drop down
17  jehovah your god is in your midst
as a mighty one he will save
he will exult over you with great joy
he will become silent in his love
he will rejoice over you with shouts of joy
18  i will gather together those grieving over their absence from your festivalsthey were absent from you because of bearing reproach for her
19  look at that time i will act against all those oppressing youand i will save the one limpingand i will gather together the dispersed
i will make them an object of praise and famein all the land of their shame
20  at that time i will bring you inat the time i gather you together
for i will make you an object of fame and praise among all the peoples of the earthwhen i gather back your captives before your eyes says jehovah
