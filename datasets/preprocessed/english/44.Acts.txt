10  now there was a man in caesareʹa named cornelius an army officer in what was called the italian unit
2  he was a devout man who feared god together with all his household and he made many gifts of mercy to the people and made supplication to god continually
3  about the ninth hour of the day he saw plainly in a vision an angel of god come in to him and say cornelius
4  cornelius stared at him terrified and asked what is it lord he said to him your prayers and gifts of mercy have ascended as a remembrance before god
5  so now send men to jopʹpa and summon a man named simon who is called peter
6  this man is staying as a guest with simon a tanner who has a house by the sea
7  as soon as the angel who spoke to him left he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who were his attendants
8  and he related everything to them and sent them to jopʹpa
9  the next day as they were continuing on their journey and were approaching the city peter went up to the housetop about the sixth hour to pray
10  but he became very hungry and wanted to eat
while they were preparing the meal he fell into a trance
11  and saw heaven opened and something descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four corners on the earth
12  and in it were all sorts of fourfooted animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven
13  then a voice said to him get up peter slaughter and eat
14  but peter said not at all lord because i have never eaten anything defiled and unclean
15  and the voice spoke again to him the second time stop calling defiled the things god has cleansed
16  this happened a third time and immediately it was taken up into heaven
17  while peter was still perplexed about what the vision he had seen could mean just then the men sent by cornelius asked where simons house was and stood there at the gate
18  they called out and inquired whether simon who was called peter was a guest there
19  as peter was still pondering over the vision the spirit said look three men are asking for you
20  so get up go downstairs and go with them not doubting at all because i have sent them
21  then peter went downstairs to the men and said here i am the one you are looking for
why are you here
22  they said cornelius an army officer a righteous and godfearing man who is wellreportedon by the whole nation of the jews was given divine instructions by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say
23  so he invited them in and had them stay as his guests
the next day he got up and went off with them and some of the brothers from jopʹpa went with him
24  the following day he entered into caesareʹa
cornelius of course was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends
25  as peter entered cornelius met him fell down at his feet and did obeisance to him
26  but peter lifted him up saying rise i too am just a man
27  as he conversed with him he went in and found many people assembled
28  he said to them you well know how unlawful it is for a jew to associate with or approach a man of another race and yet god has shown me that i should call no man defiled or unclean
29  so i came really without objection when i was sent for
therefore i ask you why you sent for me
30  then cornelius said four days ago counting from this hour i was praying in my house at the ninth hour just then a man in bright clothing stood in front of me
31  and said cornelius your prayer has been favorably heard and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before god
32  therefore send to jopʹpa and call for simon who is called peter
this man is a guest in the house of simon a tanner by the sea
33  i then sent for you at once and you were kind enough to come here
so now we are all present before god to hear all the things you have been commanded by jehovah to say
34  at this peter began to speak and he said now i truly understand that god is not partial
35  but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him
36  he sent out the word to the sons of israel to declare to them the good news of peace through jesus christthis one is lord of all
37  you know the subject that was talked about throughout all judeʹa starting from galʹilee after the baptism that john preached
38  about jesus who was from nazʹareth how god anointed him with holy spirit and power and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the devil because god was with him
39  and we are witnesses of all the things he did both in the country of the jews and in jerusalem but they did away with him by hanging him on a stake
40  god raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become manifest
41  not to all the people but to witnesses appointed beforehand by god to us who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead
42  also he ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the one decreed by god to be judge of the living and the dead
43  to him all the prophets bear witness that everyone putting faith in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name
44  while peter was still speaking about these matters the holy spirit came upon all those hearing the word
45  and the circumcised believers who had come with peter were amazed because the free gift of the holy spirit was being poured out also on people of the nations
46  for they heard them speaking in foreign languages and magnifying god
then peter responded
47  can anyone deny water to prevent these from being baptized who have received the holy spirit just as we have
48  with that he commanded them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ
then they requested him to stay for some days
4  while the two were speaking to the people the priests the captain of the temple and the sadducees came up to them
2  these were annoyed because the apostles were teaching the people and were openly declaring the resurrection of jesus from the dead
3  so they seized them and took them into custody until the next day for it was already evening
4  however many of those who had listened to the speech believed and the number of the men became about 5000
5  the next day their rulers elders and scribes gathered together in jerusalem
6  along with anʹnas the chief priest caʹiaphas john alexander and all who were relatives of the chief priest
7  they stood peter and john in their midst and began to question them by what power or in whose name did you do this
8  then peter filled with holy spirit said to them rulers of the people and elders
9  if we are being examined today about a good deed to a crippled man and you want to know who made this man well
10  let it be known to all of you and to all the people of israel that in the name of jesus christ the nazareneʹ whom you executed on a stake but whom god raised up from the dead by means of him this man stands here healthy in front of you
11  this is the stone that was treated by you builders as of no account that has become the chief cornerstone
12  furthermore there is no salvation in anyone else for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved
13  now when they saw the outspokenness of peter and john and perceived that they were uneducated and ordinary men they were astonished
and they began to realize that they had been with jesus
14  as they were looking at the man who had been cured standing with them they had nothing to say in answer to this
15  so they commanded them to go outside the sanʹhedrin hall and they began consulting with one another
16  saying what should we do with these men because for a fact a noteworthy sign has occurred through them one evident to all the inhabitants of jerusalem and we cannot deny it
17  so that this does not spread any further among the people let us threaten them and tell them not to speak to anyone anymore on the basis of this name
18  with that they called them and ordered them not to say anything at all or to teach on the basis of the name of jesus
19  but in reply peter and john said to them whether it is right in the sight of god to listen to you rather than to god judge for yourselves
20  but as for us we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard
21  so after they had threatened them further they released them since they did not find any grounds for punishing them and on account of the people because they were all glorifying god over what had happened
22  for the man on whom this miracle of healing had been done was more than 40 years old
23  after being released they went to their own people and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them
24  on hearing this they raised their voices with one accord to god and said sovereign lord you are the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them
25  and who said through holy spirit by the mouth of our forefather david your servant why did nations become agitated and peoples meditate on empty things
26  the kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers gathered together as one against jehovah and against his anointed one
27  for truly both herod and pontius pilate with men of the nations and with peoples of israel were gathered together in this city against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed
28  to do what your hand and counsel had determined beforehand to occur
29  and now jehovah give attention to their threats and grant to your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness
30  while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and wonders occur through the name of your holy servant jesus
31  and when they had made supplication the place where they were gathered together was shaken and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of god with boldness
32  moreover the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul and not even one of them would say that any of the things he possessed was his own but they had all things in common
33  and with great power the apostles continued giving the witness about the resurrection of the lord jesus and undeserved kindness was upon them all in large measure
34  in fact no one was in need among them for all those who owned fields or houses would sell them and bring the value of what was sold
35  and they would deposit it at the feet of the apostles
in turn distribution would be made to each one according to his need
36  so joseph who was also called by the apostles barʹnabas which means when translated son of comfort a levite a native of cyʹprus
37  owned a piece of land and he sold it and brought the money and deposited it at the feet of the apostles
26  agripʹpa said to paul you are permitted to speak in your own behalf
then paul stretched out his hand and proceeded to say in his defense
2  concerning all the things of which i am accused by the jews king agripʹpa i consider myself happy that it is before you i am to make my defense this day
3  especially because you are an expert on all the customs as well as the controversies among the jews
therefore i beg you to hear me patiently
4  indeed the manner of life i led from youth up among my people and in jerusalem is wellknown by all the jews
5  who were previously acquainted with me if they would be willing to testify that according to the strictest sect of our form of worship i lived as a pharisee
6  but now for the hope of the promise that was made by god to our forefathers i stand on trial
7  this is the same promise our 12 tribes are hoping to see fulfilled by intensely rendering him sacred service night and day
concerning this hope i am accused by jews o king
8  why is it considered unbelievable among you that god raises up the dead
9  i for one was convinced that i should commit many acts of opposition against the name of jesus the nazareneʹ
10  this is exactly what i did in jerusalem and i locked up many of the holy ones in prisons for i had received authority from the chief priests and when they were to be executed i cast my vote against them
11  by punishing them often in all the synagogues i tried to force them to recant and since i was extremely furious with them i went so far as to persecute them even in outlying cities
12  while doing this as i was traveling to damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests
13  i saw at midday on the road o king a light beyond the brilliance of the sun flash from heaven around me and around those traveling with me
14  and when we had all fallen to the ground i heard a voice say to me in the hebrew language saul saul why are you persecuting me to keep kicking against the goads makes it hard for you
15  but i said who are you lord and the lord said i am jesus whom you are persecuting
16  but rise and stand on your feet
this is why i have appeared to you to choose you as a servant and a witness both of things you have seen and things i will make you see respecting me
17  and i will rescue you from this people and from the nations to whom i am sending you
18  to open their eyes to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by their faith in me
19  therefore king agripʹpa i did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision
20  but to those in damascus first and then to those in jerusalem and over all the country of judeʹa and also to the nations i was bringing the message that they should repent and turn to god by doing works that befit repentance
21  this is why the jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me
22  however because i have experienced the help that is from god i continue to this day bearing witness to both small and great saying nothing except what the prophets as well as moses stated was going to take place
23  that the christ was to suffer and that as the first to be resurrected from the dead he was going to proclaim light both to this people and to the nations
24  now as paul was saying these things in his defense festus said in a loud voice you are going out of your mind paul great learning is driving you out of your mind
25  but paul said i am not going out of my mind your excellency festus but i am speaking words of truth and of a sound mind
26  for a fact the king to whom i am speaking so freely well knows about these things i am convinced that not one of these things escapes his notice for none of this has been done in a corner
27  do you king agripʹpa believe the prophets i know that you believe
28  but agripʹpa said to paul in a short time you would persuade me to become a christian
29  at this paul said i wish to god that whether in a short time or in a long time not only you but also all those who hear me today would become men such as i am with the exception of these prison bonds
30  then the king rose and so did the governor and bernice and the men seated with them
31  but as they were leaving they began saying to one another this man is doing nothing deserving of death or prison bonds
32  agripʹpa then said to festus this man could have been released if he had not appealed to caesar
11  now the apostles and the brothers who were in judeʹa heard that people of the nations had also accepted the word of god
2  so when peter came up to jerusalem the supporters of circumcision began to criticize him
3  saying you went into the house of men who were not circumcised and ate with them
4  at this peter went on to explain the matter in detail to them saying
5  i was in the city of jopʹpa praying and while in a trance i saw a vision something descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four corners from heaven and it came right down to me
6  looking closely into it i observed fourfooted animals of the earth wild beasts reptiles and birds of heaven
7  i also heard a voice say to me get up peter slaughter and eat
8  but i said certainly not lord because a defiled or unclean thing has never entered my mouth
9  the second time the voice from heaven answered you stop calling defiled the things god has cleansed
10  this happened a third time and everything was pulled up again into heaven
11  also just at that moment three men were standing at the house where we were staying having been sent to me from caesareʹa
12  then the spirit told me to go with them not doubting at all
but these six brothers also went with me and we entered into the house of the man
13  he reported to us how he saw the angel stand in his house and say send men to jopʹpa and summon simon who is called peter
14  and he will tell you things by which you and all your household may get saved
15  but when i started to speak the holy spirit fell on them just as it did also on us in the beginning
16  at this i recalled the saying of the lord how he used to say john baptized with water but you will be baptized with holy spirit
17  if therefore god gave the same free gift to them that he gave to us who have believed in the lord jesus christ who was i that i should be able to hinder god
18  when they heard these things they stopped objecting and they glorified god saying so then god has also granted to people of the nations repentance leading to life
19  now those who had been scattered by the tribulation that arose over stephen went as far as phoeniʹcia cyʹprus and antioch but they spoke the word only to the jews
20  however some of the men among them from cyʹprus and cyreʹne came to antioch and began talking to the greekspeaking people declaring the good news of the lord jesus
21  furthermore the hand of jehovah was with them and a great number became believers and turned to the lord
22  the report about them reached the ears of the congregation in jerusalem and they sent out barʹnabas as far as antioch
23  when he arrived and saw the undeserved kindness of god he rejoiced and began to encourage them all to continue in the lord with heartfelt resolve
24  for he was a good man and full of holy spirit and faith
and a considerable crowd was added to the lord
25  so he went to tarsus to make a thorough search for saul
26  after he found him he brought him to antioch
so for a whole year they assembled with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd and it was first in antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called christians
27  in those days prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch
28  one of them named agʹabus stood up and foretold through the spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire inhabited earth which in fact did take place in the time of claudius
29  so the disciples determined each according to what he could afford to send relief to the brothers living in judeʹa
30  and this they did sending it to the elders by the hand of barʹnabas and saul
8  saul for his part approved of his murder
on that day great persecution arose against the congregation that was in jerusalem all except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of judeʹa and samarʹia
2  but devout men carried stephen away to bury him and they made a great mourning over him
3  saul though began to ravage the congregation
he would invade one house after another dragging out both men and women and turning them over to prison
4  however those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word
5  now philip went down to the city of samarʹia and began to preach the christ to them
6  the crowds with one accord were paying attention to what philip said while they listened and observed the signs he was performing
7  for many had unclean spirits and these would cry out with a loud voice and come out
moreover many who were paralyzed and lame were cured
8  so there came to be a great deal of joy in that city
9  now in the city was a man named simon who prior to this had been practicing magical arts and amazing the nation of samarʹia claiming that he was somebody great
10  all of them from the least to the greatest would pay attention to him and say this man is the power of god which is called great
11  so they would pay attention to him because he had amazed them for quite a while by his magical arts
12  but when they believed philip who was declaring the good news of the kingdom of god and of the name of jesus christ both men and women were getting baptized
13  simon himself also became a believer and after being baptized he continued with philip and he was amazed at seeing the signs and great powerful works taking place
14  when the apostles in jerusalem heard that samarʹia had accepted the word of god they sent peter and john to them
15  and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit
16  for it had not yet come upon any one of them but they had only been baptized in the name of the lord jesus
17  then they laid their hands on them and they began to receive holy spirit
18  now when simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles he offered them money
19  saying give me this authority also so that anyone on whom i lay my hands may receive holy spirit
20  but peter said to him may your silver perish with you because you thought you could acquire the free gift of god with money
21  you have neither part nor share in this matter for your heart is not straight in the sight of god
22  so repent of this badness of yours and supplicate jehovah that if possible the wicked intention of your heart may be forgiven you
23  for i see you are a bitter poison and a slave of unrighteousness
24  in answer simon said to them make supplication for me to jehovah that none of the things you have said may come upon me
25  therefore when they had given the witness thoroughly and had spoken the word of jehovah they started back toward jerusalem and they went declaring the good news to many villages of the samarʹitans
26  however jehovahs angel spoke to philip saying get up and go to the south to the road that runs down from jerusalem to gazʹa
this is a desert road
27  with that he got up and went and look an ethioʹpian eunuch a man who had authority under candaʹce queen of the ethioʹpians and who was in charge of all her treasure
he had gone to jerusalem to worship
28  and he was returning and was sitting in his chariot reading aloud the prophet isaiah
29  so the spirit said to philip go over and approach this chariot
30  philip ran alongside and heard him reading aloud isaiah the prophet and he said do you actually know what you are reading
31  he said really how could i ever do so unless someone guided me so he urged philip to get on and sit down with him
32  now this was the passage of scripture that he was reading like a sheep he was brought to the slaughter and like a lamb that is silent before its shearer so he does not open his mouth
33  during his humiliation justice was taken away from him
who will tell the details of his generation because his life is taken away from the earth
34  the eunuch then said to philip i beg you about whom does the prophet say this about himself or about some other man
35  philip began to speak and starting with this scripture he declared to him the good news about jesus
36  now as they were going along the road they came to a body of water and the eunuch said look here is water what prevents me from getting baptized
37  
38  with that he commanded the chariot to halt and both philip and the eunuch went down into the water and he baptized him
39  when they came up out of the water jehovahs spirit quickly led philip away and the eunuch did not see him anymore but he went on his way rejoicing
40  philip however found himself in ashʹdod and he went through the territory and kept on declaring the good news to all the cities until he got to caesareʹa
16  so he arrived at derʹbe and also at lysʹtra
and a disciple named timothy was there the son of a believing jewish woman but of a greek father
2  and he was wellreportedon by the brothers in lysʹtra and icoʹnium
3  paul expressed the desire for timothy to accompany him and he took him and circumcised him because of the jews in those places for they all knew that his father was a greek
4  as they traveled on through the cities they would deliver to them for observance the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and the elders who were in jerusalem
5  then indeed the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number day by day
6  moreover they traveled through phrygʹia and the country of galaʹtia because they were forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in the province of asia
7  further when they came down to mysʹia they made efforts to go into bithynʹia but the spirit of jesus did not permit them
8  so they passed by mysʹia and came down to troʹas
9  and during the night a vision appeared to paula macedoʹnian man was standing there urging him and saying step over into macedoʹnia and help us
10  as soon as he had seen the vision we tried to go into macedoʹnia drawing the conclusion that god had summoned us to declare the good news to them
11  so we put out to sea from troʹas and made a straight run to samʹothrace but on the following day to neapʹolis
12  and from there we went to philipʹpi a colony which is the principal city of the district of macedoʹnia
we stayed in this city for some days
13  on the sabbath day we went outside the gate beside a river where we thought there was a place of prayer and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled
14  and a woman named lydʹia a seller of purple from the city of thyatiʹra and a worshipper of god was listening and jehovah opened her heart wide to pay attention to the things paul was saying
15  now when she and her household got baptized she urged us if you have considered me to be faithful to jehovah come and stay at my house
and she just made us come
16  now it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer a servant girl with a spirit a demon of divination met us
she supplied her masters with much profit by fortunetelling
17  this girl kept following paul and us and crying out with the words these men are slaves of the most high god and are proclaiming to you the way of salvation
18  she kept doing this for many days
finally paul got tired of it and turned and said to the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her
and it came out that very hour
19  well when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers
20  leading them up to the civil magistrates they said these men are disturbing our city very much
they are jews
21  and they are proclaiming customs that it is not lawful for us to adopt or practice seeing that we are romans
22  and the crowd rose up together against them and the civil magistrates after tearing the garments off them gave the command to beat them with rods
23  after they had inflicted many blows on them they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to guard them securely
24  because he got such an order he threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks
25  but about the middle of the night paul and silas were praying and praising god with song and the prisoners were listening to them
26  suddenly a great earthquake occurred so that the foundations of the jail were shaken
moreover all the doors were instantly opened and everyones bonds came loose
27  when the jailer woke up and saw that the prison doors were open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself assuming that the prisoners had escaped
28  but paul called out with a loud voice do not hurt yourself for we are all here
29  so he asked for lights and rushed in and seized with trembling he fell down before paul and silas
30  he brought them outside and said sirs what must i do to get saved
31  they said believe in the lord jesus and you will get saved you and your household
32  then they spoke the word of jehovah to him together with all those in his house
33  and he took them along in that hour of the night and washed their wounds
then he and his entire household were baptized without delay
34  he brought them into his house and set a table before them and he rejoiced greatly with all his household now that he had believed in god
35  when it became day the civil magistrates sent the constables to say release those men
36  the jailer reported their words to paul the civil magistrates have sent men to have you two released
so come out now and go in peace
37  but paul said to them they flogged us publicly uncondemned though we are romans and threw us into prison
are they now throwing us out secretly no indeed let them come themselves and escort us out
38  the constables reported these words to the civil magistrates
these grew fearful when they heard that the men were romans
39  so they came and pleaded with them and after escorting them out they requested them to depart from the city
40  but they came out of the prison and went to the home of lydʹia and when they saw the brothers they encouraged them and departed
18  after this he departed from athens and came to corinth
2  and he found a jew named aqʹuila a native of ponʹtus who had recently come from italy with priscilʹla his wife because claudius had ordered all the jews to leave rome
so he went to them
3  and because he had the same trade he stayed at their home and worked with them for they were tentmakers by trade
4  he would give a talk in the synagogue every sabbath and would persuade jews and greeks
5  when now both silas and timothy came down from macedoʹnia paul began to be intensely occupied with the word witnessing to the jews to prove that jesus is the christ
6  but after they kept on opposing him and speaking abusively he shook out his garments and said to them let your blood be on your own heads
i am clean
from now on i will go to people of the nations
7  so he transferred from there and went into the house of a man named titius justus a worshipper of god whose house adjoined the synagogue
8  but crisʹpus the presiding officer of the synagogue became a believer in the lord along with all his household
and many of the corinthians who heard began to believe and be baptized
9  moreover the lord said to paul in a vision by night do not be afraid but keep on speaking and do not keep silent
10  for i am with you and no man will assault you to harm you for i have many people in this city
11  so he stayed there for a year and six months teaching the word of god among them
12  while galʹlio was proconsul of achaʹia the jews made a concerted attack against paul and led him to the judgment seat
13  saying this man is persuading people to worship god in a way contrary to the law
14  but as paul was about to speak galʹlio said to the jews if indeed it were some wrong or a serious crime o jews it would be reasonable for me to hear you out patiently
15  but if it is controversies over speech and names and your own law you yourselves must see to it
i do not wish to be a judge of these things
16  with that he drove them away from the judgment seat
17  so they all seized sosʹthenes the presiding officer of the synagogue and began beating him in front of the judgment seat
but galʹlio would not get involved at all with these things
18  however after staying quite a few days longer paul said goodbye to the brothers and sailed away for syria accompanied by priscilʹla and aqʹuila
he had his hair clipped short in cenʹchreae for he had made a vow
19  so they arrived at ephʹesus and he left them there but he entered the synagogue and reasoned with the jews
20  although they kept requesting him to stay longer he would not consent
21  but said goodbye and told them i will return to you again if jehovah is willing
and he put out to sea from ephʹesus
22  and came down to caesareʹa
and he went up and greeted the congregation and then went down to antioch
23  after spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the country of galaʹtia and phrygʹia strengthening all the disciples
24  now a jew named apolʹlos a native of alexandria arrived in ephʹesus he was an eloquent man who was wellversed in the scriptures
25  this man had been instructed in the way of jehovah and aglow with the spirit he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about jesus but he was acquainted only with the baptism of john
26  he began to speak boldly in the synagogue and when priscilʹla and aqʹuila heard him they took him into their company and explained the way of god more accurately to him
27  further because he wanted to go across to achaʹia the brothers wrote to the disciples urging them to receive him kindly
so when he got there he greatly helped those who through gods undeserved kindness had become believers
28  for publicly and with great intensity he thoroughly proved the jews to be wrong showing them from the scriptures that jesus is the christ
17  they now traveled through amphipʹolis and apolloʹnia and came to thessaloniʹca where there was a synagogue of the jews
2  so according to pauls custom he went inside to them and for three sabbaths he reasoned with them from the scriptures
3  explaining and proving by references that it was necessary for the christ to suffer and to rise from the dead saying this is the christ this jesus whom i am proclaiming to you
4  as a result some of them became believers and associated themselves with paul and silas and so did a great multitude of the greeks who worshipped god along with quite a few of the principal women
5  but the jews getting jealous gathered together some wicked men who were loitering at the marketplace and formed a mob and proceeded to throw the city into an uproar
they assaulted the house of jaʹson and were seeking to have paul and silas brought out to the mob
6  when they did not find them they dragged jaʹson and some of the brothers to the city rulers crying out these men who have overturned the inhabited earth are present here also
7  and jaʹson has received them as his guests
all these men act in opposition to the decrees of caesar saying there is another king jesus
8  when they heard these things the crowd and the city rulers were alarmed
9  and after taking sufficient security from jaʹson and the others they let them go
10  immediately by night the brothers sent both paul and silas to beroeʹa
on arriving they went into the synagogue of the jews
11  now these were more nobleminded than those in thessaloniʹca for they accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind carefully examining the scriptures daily to see whether these things were so
12  therefore many of them became believers and so did quite a few of the reputable greek women as well as some of the men
13  but when the jews from thessaloniʹca learned that the word of god was also being proclaimed by paul in beroeʹa they came there to incite and agitate the crowds
14  then the brothers immediately sent paul away to the sea but both silas and timothy remained behind there
15  however those accompanying paul brought him as far as athens and they departed after receiving instructions that silas and timothy should come to paul as quickly as possible
16  now while paul was waiting for them in athens his spirit within him became irritated on seeing that the city was full of idols
17  so he began to reason in the synagogue with the jews and the other people who worshipped god and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand
18  but some of both the epicureʹan and the stoʹic philosophers began disputing with him and some were saying what is it this chatterer would like to tell others he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities
this was because he was declaring the good news of jesus and the resurrection
19  so they took hold of him and led him to the areopʹagus saying can we get to know what this new teaching is that you are speaking about
20  for you are introducing some things that are strange to our ears and we want to know what these things mean
21  in fact all athenians and the foreigners staying there would spend their leisure time doing nothing else but telling or listening to something new
22  paul now stood in the midst of the areopʹagus and said men of athens i see that in all things you seem to be more given to the fear of the deities than others are
23  for instance while passing along and carefully observing your objects of veneration i found even an altar on which had been inscribed to an unknown god
therefore what you are unknowingly worshipping this i am declaring to you
24  the god who made the world and all the things in it being as he is lord of heaven and earth does not dwell in handmade temples
25  nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything because he himself gives to all people life and breath and all things
26  and he made out of one man every nation of men to dwell on the entire surface of the earth and he decreed the appointed times and the set limits of where men would dwell
27  so that they would seek god if they might grope for him and really find him although in fact he is not far off from each one of us
28  for by him we have life and move and exist even as some of your own poets have said for we are also his children
29  therefore since we are the children of god we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone like something sculptured by the art and design of humans
30  true god has overlooked the times of such ignorance but now he is declaring to all people everywhere that they should repent
31  because he has set a day on which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed and he has provided a guarantee to all men by resurrecting him from the dead
32  now when they heard of a resurrection of the dead some began to scoff while others said we will hear you again about this
33  so paul left them
34  but some men joined him and became believers
among them were dionysʹius who was a judge of the court of the areopʹagus and a woman named damʹaris and others besides them
9  but saul still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the lord went to the high priest
2  and asked him for letters to the synagogues in damascus so that he might bring bound to jerusalem any whom he found who belonged to the way both men and women
3  now as he was traveling and getting near damascus suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him
4  and he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him saul saul why are you persecuting me
5  he asked who are you lord he said i am jesus whom you are persecuting
6  but get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do
7  now the men who were traveling with him stood speechless hearing indeed the sound of a voice but seeing no one
8  saul then got up from the ground and though his eyes were open he could see nothing
so they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus
9  and for three days he did not see anything and he neither ate nor drank
10  there was a disciple named ananiʹas in damascus and the lord said to him in a vision ananiʹas he said here i am lord
11  the lord said to him get up go to the street called straight and look for a man named saul from tarsus at the house of judas
for look he is praying
12  and in a vision he has seen a man named ananiʹas come in and lay his hands on him so that he may recover sight
13  but ananiʹas answered lord i have heard from many about this man about all the harm he did to your holy ones in jerusalem
14  and here he has authority from the chief priests to arrest all those calling on your name
15  but the lord said to him go because this man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of israel
16  for i will show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name
17  so ananiʹas went and entered the house and he laid his hands on him and said saul brother the lord jesus who appeared to you on the road along which you were coming has sent me so that you may recover sight and be filled with holy spirit
18  and immediately what looked like scales fell from his eyes and he recovered his sight
he then got up and was baptized
19  and he ate some food and gained strength
he stayed for some days with the disciples in damascus
20  and immediately in the synagogues he began to preach about jesus that this one is the son of god
21  but all those hearing him were astonished and were saying is this not the man who ravaged those in jerusalem who call on this name did he not come here for the purpose of arresting them and taking them to the chief priests
22  but saul kept on acquiring more and more power and was confounding the jews who lived in damascus as he proved logically that this is the christ
23  now when many days had passed the jews plotted together to do away with him
24  however their plot against saul became known to him
they were also watching the gates closely both day and night in order to do away with him
25  so his disciples took him and let him down by night through an opening in the wall lowering him in a basket
26  on arriving in jerusalem he made efforts to join the disciples but they were all afraid of him because they did not believe he was a disciple
27  so barʹnabas came to his aid and led him to the apostles and he told them in detail how on the road he had seen the lord and that he had spoken to him and how in damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of jesus
28  so he remained with them moving about freely in jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the lord
29  he was talking and disputing with the greekspeaking jews but these made attempts to do away with him
30  when the brothers found out about this they brought him down to caesareʹa and sent him off to tarsus
31  then indeed the congregation throughout the whole of judeʹa and galʹilee and samarʹia entered into a period of peace being built up and as it walked in the fear of jehovah and in the comfort of the holy spirit it kept on multiplying
32  now as peter was traveling through all the region he came down also to the holy ones who lived in lydʹda
33  there he found a man named aeneʹas who had been lying flat on his bed for eight years for he was paralyzed
34  peter said to him aeneʹas jesus christ heals you
rise and make up your bed
and he got up immediately
35  when all those living in lydʹda and the plain of sharʹon saw him they turned to the lord
36  now there was in jopʹpa a disciple named tabʹitha which means when translated dorʹcas
she abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy that she was making
37  but in those days she fell sick and died
so they bathed her and laid her in an upper room
38  since lydʹda was near jopʹpa when the disciples heard that peter was in that city they sent two men to him to urge him please come to us without delay
39  at that peter got up and went with them
and when he arrived they led him up into the upper room and all the widows presented themselves to him weeping and showing many garments and robes that dorʹcas had made while she was with them
40  peter then put everyone outside and kneeling down he prayed
then turning toward the body he said tabʹitha rise she opened her eyes and as she caught sight of peter she sat up
41  giving her his hand he raised her up and he called the holy ones and the widows and presented her alive
42  this became known throughout all jopʹpa and many became believers in the lord
43  he remained for quite a few days in jopʹpa with a tanner named simon
28  after we made it to safety we learned that the island was called malta
2  and the foreignspeaking people showed us extraordinary kindness
they kindled a fire and received all of us kindly because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold
3  but when paul collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand
4  when the foreignspeaking people caught sight of the venomous creature hanging from his hand they began saying to one another surely this man is a murderer and although he made it to safety from the sea justice did not permit him to keep on living
5  however he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm
6  but they were expecting him to swell up or suddenly to drop dead
after they waited for a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him they changed their mind and began saying he was a god
7  now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the principal man of the island whose name was pubʹlius and he welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days
8  it so happened that the father of pubʹlius was lying in bed sick with fever and dysentery and paul went in to him and prayed laid his hands on him and healed him
9  after this occurred the rest of the people on the island who were sick also began to come to him and be cured
10  they also honored us with many gifts and when we were setting sail they loaded us up with whatever we needed
11  three months later we set sail in a ship with the figurehead sons of zeus
the ship was from alexandria and had wintered in the island
12  putting into port at syracuse we remained there for three days
13  from there we went along and arrived at rheʹgium
a day later a south wind sprang up and we made it into puteʹoli on the second day
14  here we found brothers and were urged to remain with them for seven days and so we went toward rome
15  from there the brothers when they heard the news about us came as far as the marketplace of apʹpius and three taverns to meet us
on catching sight of them paul thanked god and took courage
16  when finally we entered rome paul was permitted to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him
17  however three days later he called together the principal men of the jews
when they had assembled he said to them men brothers although i had done nothing contrary to the people or the customs of our forefathers i was handed over as a prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans
18  and after making an examination they wanted to release me for there were no grounds for putting me to death
19  but when the jews objected i was compelled to appeal to caesar but not because i had any accusation to make against my nation
20  so for this reason i asked to see and speak to you for it is because of the hope of israel that i have this chain around me
21  they said to him we have not received letters about you from judeʹa nor have any of the brothers who came from there reported or spoken anything bad about you
22  but we think it proper to hear from you what your thoughts are for truly as regards this sect we know that it is spoken against everywhere
23  they now arranged for a day to meet with him and they came in even greater numbers to him in his lodging place
and from morning to evening he explained the matter to them by bearing thorough witness concerning the kingdom of god to persuade them about jesus from both the law of moses and the prophets
24  some began to believe the things he said others would not believe
25  so because they disagreed with one another they began to leave and paul made this one comment the holy spirit aptly spoke through isaiah the prophet to your forefathers
26  saying go to this people and say you will indeed hear but by no means understand and you will indeed look but by no means see
27  for the heart of this people has grown unreceptive and with their ears they have heard without response and they have shut their eyes so that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn back and i heal them
28  so let it be known to you that this salvation from god has been sent out to the nations they will certainly listen to it
29  
30  so he remained there for an entire two years in his own rented house and he would kindly receive all those who came to him
31  preaching the kingdom of god to them and teaching about the lord jesus christ with the greatest freeness of speech without hindrance
27  now as it was decided for us to sail away to italy they handed paul and some other prisoners over to an army officer named julius of the unit of augusʹtus
2  going aboard a ship from adramytʹtium that was about to sail to ports along the coast of the province of asia we set sail aristarʹchus a macedoʹnian from thessaloniʹca was with us
3  the next day we landed at siʹdon and julius treated paul with kindness and permitted him to go to his friends and enjoy their care
4  and putting out to sea from there we sailed under the shelter of cyʹprus because the winds were against us
5  then we navigated through the open sea along ciliʹcia and pamphylʹia and put into port at myʹra in lyʹcia
6  there the army officer found a ship from alexandria that was sailing for italy and he made us board it
7  then after sailing on slowly quite a number of days we came to cniʹdus with difficulty
because the wind did not let us make headway we sailed under the shelter of crete off salmoʹne
8  and sailing with difficulty along the coast we came to a place called fair havens which was near the city of laseʹa
9  a considerable time had passed and by now it was hazardous to navigate because even the fast of atonement day was already over so paul made a recommendation
10  to them men i can see that this voyage is going to result in damage and great loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives
11  however the army officer listened to the pilot and the shipowner rather than to what paul was saying
12  since the harbor was unsuitable for wintering the majority advised setting sail from there to see if they could somehow make it to spend the winter in phoenix a harbor of crete that opens toward the northeast and toward the southeast
13  when the south wind blew softly they thought they had achieved their purpose and they lifted anchor and began sailing along crete close to the shore
14  after a short time however a violent wind called euroaqʹuilo rushed down on it
15  as the ship was violently seized and was not able to keep its head against the wind we gave way to it and were driven along
16  then we ran under the shelter of a small island called cauʹda and yet we were hardly able to get the skiff at the stern of the ship under control
17  but after hoisting it aboard they used supports to undergird the ship and fearing that they would run aground on the syrʹtis they lowered the gear and so were driven along
18  because we were being violently tossed by the storm they began to lighten the ship the following day
19  and on the third day they threw away the tackling of the ship with their own hands
20  when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a violent storm was battering us all hope of our being saved finally began to fade
21  after they had gone a long time without food paul stood up in their midst and said men you certainly should have taken my advice and not have put out to sea from crete and as a result suffered this damage and loss
22  still i now urge you to take courage for not one of you will be lost only the ship will
23  this night an angel of the god to whom i belong and to whom i render sacred service stood by me
24  and said have no fear paul
you must stand before caesar and look god has granted to you all those sailing with you
25  so take courage men for i believe god that it will be exactly as i was told
26  however we must be cast ashore on some island
27  now when the 14th night fell and we were being tossed about on the sea of aʹdria at midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were getting near to some land
28  they sounded the depth and found it 20 fathoms so they proceeded a short distance and again made a sounding and found it 15 fathoms
29  and fearing that we might run aground on the rocks they cast out four anchors from the stern and began wishing for it to become day
30  but when the sailors began trying to escape from the ship and were lowering the skiff into the sea under the pretense of intending to let down anchors from the bow
31  paul said to the army officer and the soldiers unless these men remain in the ship you cannot be saved
32  then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off
33  now close to daybreak paul encouraged them all to take some food saying today is the 14th day you have been waiting anxiously and you have gone without taking any food at all
34  so i encourage you to eat some food this is in the interests of your safety for not a hair of the head of any one of you will perish
35  after he said this he took bread gave thanks to god before them all broke it and started eating
36  so they all took courage and began taking some food themselves
37  in all we were 276 persons in the ship
38  when they had eaten enough food to be satisfied they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard into the sea
39  when daylight came they could not recognize the land but they saw a bay with a beach and were determined to beach the ship there if they could
40  so they cut away the anchors and let them fall into the sea at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudder oars and after hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach
41  when they struck a shoal washed on each side by the sea they ran the ship aground and the bow got stuck and stayed immovable but the stern began to be violently broken to pieces by the waves
42  at this the soldiers decided to kill the prisoners so that no one might swim away and escape
43  but the army officer was determined to bring paul safely through and prevented them from carrying out their plan
he commanded those able to swim to jump into the sea and make it to land first
44  and the rest were to follow some on planks and some on pieces of the ship
so all were brought safely to land
7  but the high priest said are these things so
2  stephen replied men brothers and fathers listen
the god of glory appeared to our forefather abraham while he was in mesopotaʹmia before he took up residence in haʹran
3  and he said to him go out from your land and from your relatives and come into the land that i will show you
4  then he went out of the land of the chaldeʹans and took up residence in haʹran
and from there after his father died god caused him to resettle in this land where you now dwell
5  and yet he did not give him any inheritance in it no not even enough to put his foot on but he promised to give it to him as a possession and after him to his offspring though as yet he had no child
6  moreover god told him that his offspring would be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people would enslave them and afflict them for 400 years
7  and that nation for which they will slave i will judge god said and after these things they will come out and will offer sacred service to me in this place
8  he also gave him a covenant of circumcision and he became the father of isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day and isaac became the father of jacob and jacob of the 12 family heads
9  and the family heads became jealous of joseph and sold him into egypt
but god was with him
10  and he rescued him out of all his tribulations and gave him favor and wisdom before pharʹaoh king of egypt
and he appointed him to govern egypt and his whole house
11  but a famine came on all of egypt and caʹnaan yes a great tribulation and our forefathers could not find anything to eat
12  but jacob heard that there were food supplies in egypt and he sent our forefathers out the first time
13  during the second time joseph made himself known to his brothers and the family of joseph became known to pharʹaoh
14  so joseph sent a message and called his father jacob and all his relatives from that place 75 persons in all
15  so jacob went down into egypt and he died there and so did our forefathers
16  they were carried to sheʹchem and were laid in the tomb that abraham had bought for a sum of silver money from the sons of haʹmor in sheʹchem
17  just as the time was approaching to fulfill the promise that god had announced to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt
18  until there rose a different king over egypt one who did not know of joseph
19  this one dealt cunningly with our race and wrongfully forced the fathers to abandon their infants so that they would not be kept alive
20  at that time moses was born and he was divinely beautiful
and he was nursed for three months in his fathers home
21  but when he was abandoned the daughter of pharʹaoh took him and brought him up as her own son
22  so moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians
in fact he was powerful in his words and deeds
23  now when he reached the age of 40 it came into his heart to make a visit on his brothers the sons of israel
24  when he caught sight of one of them being unjustly treated he defended him and avenged the one being abused by striking down the egyptian
25  he thought that his brothers would grasp that god was giving them salvation by his hand but they did not grasp it
26  the next day he appeared to them as they were fighting and he tried to reconcile them in peace saying men you are brothers
why do you mistreat each other
27  but the one who was mistreating his neighbor pushed him away saying who appointed you ruler and judge over us
28  you do not want to do away with me the way you did away with the egyptian yesterday do you
29  on hearing this moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of midʹian where he became the father of two sons
30  after 40 years had passed an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount siʹnai in the flame of a burning thornbush
31  when moses saw it he was amazed at the sight
but as he was approaching to investigate jehovahs voice was heard
32  i am the god of your forefathers the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob
moses started trembling and did not dare to investigate further
33  jehovah said to him remove the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy ground
34  i have certainly seen the oppression of my people who are in egypt and i have heard their groaning and i have come down to rescue them
now come i will send you off to egypt
35  this same moses whom they had disowned saying who appointed you ruler and judge is the very one god sent as both ruler and deliverer by means of the angel who appeared to him in the thornbush
36  this man led them out performing wonders and signs in egypt and at the red sea and in the wilderness for 40 years
37  this is the moses who said to the sons of israel god will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me
38  this is the one who came to be among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on mount siʹnai and with our forefathers and he received living sacred pronouncements to give us
39  our forefathers refused to obey him but they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to egypt
40  saying to aaron make gods for us to go ahead of us
for we do not know what has happened to this moses who led us out of the land of egypt
41  so they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol and began to enjoy themselves in the works of their hands
42  so god turned away from them and handed them over to offer sacred service to the army of heaven just as it is written in the book of the prophets it was not to me that you made offerings and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness was it o house of israel
43  but it was the tent of moʹloch and the star of the god reʹphan that you took up the images that you made to worship them
so i will deport you beyond babylon
44  our forefathers had the tent of the witness in the wilderness just as he gave orders when speaking to moses to make it according to the pattern he had seen
45  and our forefathers received possession of it and brought it in with joshua into the land possessed by the nations whom god drove out from before our forefathers
here it remained until the days of david
46  he found favor in the sight of god and asked for the privilege of providing a dwelling place for the god of jacob
47  but it was solʹomon who built a house for him
48  however the most high does not dwell in houses made with hands just as the prophet says
49  the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool
what sort of house will you build for me jehovah says
or where is my restingplace
50  my hand made all these things did it not
51  obstinate men and uncircumcised in hearts and ears you are always resisting the holy spirit as your forefathers did so you do
52  which one of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute yes they killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one whose betrayers and murderers you have now become
53  you who received the law as transmitted by angels but have not kept it
54  well at hearing these things they were infuriated in their hearts and began to grind their teeth at him
55  but he being full of holy spirit gazed into heaven and caught sight of gods glory and of jesus standing at gods right hand
56  and he said look i see the heavens opened up and the son of man standing at gods right hand
57  at this they cried out at the top of their voices and put their hands over their ears and rushed at him all together
58  after throwing him outside the city they began stoning him
the witnesses laid down their outer garments at the feet of a young man called saul
59  as they were stoning stephen he made this appeal lord jesus receive my spirit
60  then kneeling down he cried out with a strong voice jehovah do not charge this sin against them
and after saying this he fell asleep in death
23  looking intently at the sanʹhedrin paul said men brothers i have behaved before god with a perfectly clear conscience down to this day
2  at this the high priest ananiʹas ordered those standing by him to strike him on the mouth
3  then paul said to him god is going to strike you you whitewashed wall
do you sit to judge me according to the law and at the same time violate the law by commanding me to be struck
4  those standing by said are you insulting the high priest of god
5  and paul said brothers i did not know he was high priest
for it is written you must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people
6  now paul knowing that the one part was made up of sadducees but the other of pharisees cried out in the sanʹhedrin men brothers i am a pharisee a son of pharisees
over the hope of the resurrection of the dead i am being judged
7  because he said this a dissension arose between the pharisees and the sadducees and the assembly was split
8  for the sadducees say that there is neither resurrection nor angel nor spirit but the pharisees accept them all
9  so a great uproar broke out and some of the scribes of the party of the pharisees rose and began arguing fiercely saying we find nothing wrong in this man but if a spirit or an angel spoke to him
10  now when the dissension grew great the military commander feared that paul would be torn apart by them and he commanded the soldiers to go down and snatch him from their midst and bring him into the soldiers quarters
11  but the following night the lord stood by him and said take courage for just as you have been giving a thorough witness about me in jerusalem so you must also bear witness in rome
12  when it became day the jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed paul
13  there were more than 40 men who formed this oathbound conspiracy
14  these men went to the chief priests and the elders and said we have solemnly bound ourselves with a curse not to eat anything at all until we have killed paul
15  so now you together with the sanʹhedrin should inform the military commander that he should bring him down to you as though you want to examine his case more thoroughly
but before he gets near we will be ready to do away with him
16  however the son of pauls sister heard of the ambush they were planning and he entered the soldiers quarters and reported it to paul
17  paul then called one of the army officers to him and said take this young man to the military commander for he has something to report to him
18  so he brought him and led him to the military commander and said the prisoner paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you
19  the military commander took him by the hand and withdrew privately and asked him what do you have to report to me
20  he said the jews have agreed to request you to bring paul down to the sanʹhedrin tomorrow as though they intend to learn more details about his case
21  but do not let them persuade you for more than 40 of their men are waiting to ambush him and they have bound themselves with a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him and they are now ready waiting for the promise from you
22  so the military commander let the young man go after ordering him do not tell anyone that you have informed me of this
23  and he summoned two of the army officers and said get 200 soldiers ready to march clear to caesareʹa also 70 horsemen and 200 spearmen at the third hour of the night
24  also provide horses for paul to ride to take him safely to felix the governor
25  and he wrote a letter with this content
26  claudius lysʹias to his excellency governor felix greetings
27  this man was seized by the jews and was about to be killed by them but i came quickly with my soldiers and rescued him because i learned that he is a roman
28  and wanting to find out the cause for which they were accusing him i brought him down into their sanʹhedrin
29  i found him to be accused about questions of their law but not charged with a single thing deserving of death or prison bonds
30  but because a plot against the man has been made known to me i am at once sending him to you and ordering the accusers to speak against him before you
31  so these soldiers took paul according to their orders and brought him by night to antipʹatris
32  the next day they permitted the horsemen to go on with him but they returned to the soldiers quarters
33  the horsemen entered caesareʹa and delivered the letter to the governor and also presented paul to him
34  so he read it and asked what province he was from and learned that he was from ciliʹcia
35  i will give you a thorough hearing he said when your accusers arrive
and he commanded that he be kept under guard in herods palace
22  men brothers and fathers hear my defense to you now
2  well when they heard that he was addressing them in the hebrew language they kept all the more silent and he said
3  i am a jew born in tarsus of ciliʹcia but educated in this city at the feet of gamaʹliel instructed according to the strictness of the ancestral law and zealous for god just as all of you are this day
4  i persecuted this way to the point of death binding and handing over to prisons both men and women
5  as the high priest and all the assembly of elders can bear witness
from them i also obtained letters to the brothers in damascus and i was on my way to bring those who were there in bonds to jerusalem to be punished
6  but as i was traveling and getting near to damascus about midday suddenly out of heaven a great light flashed all around me
7  and i fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me saul saul why are you persecuting me
8  i answered who are you lord and he said to me i am jesus the nazareneʹ whom you are persecuting
9  now the men who were with me did see the light but they did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me
10  at that i said what should i do lord the lord said to me rise go into damascus and there you will be told about everything it is appointed for you to do
11  but since i could not see anything because of the glory of that light i arrived in damascus led by the hand of those who were with me
12  then a man named ananiʹas a devout man according to the law wellreportedon by all the jews living there
13  came to me
he stood by me and said to me saul brother regain your sight and that very moment i looked up and saw him
14  he said the god of our forefathers has chosen you to come to know his will and to see the righteous one and to hear the voice of his mouth
15  because you are to be a witness for him to all men of the things you have seen and heard
16  and now why are you delaying rise get baptized and wash your sins away by your calling on his name
17  but when i had returned to jerusalem and was praying in the temple i fell into a trance
18  and saw him saying to me hurry up and get out of jerusalem quickly because they will not accept your witness concerning me
19  and i said lord they themselves well know that i used to imprison and flog in one synagogue after another those believing in you
20  and when the blood of stephen your witness was being spilled i was standing by and approving and guarding the outer garments of those doing away with him
21  and yet he said to me go because i will send you out to nations far away
22  now they kept listening to him down to this word
then they raised their voices saying take such a man away from the earth for he is not fit to live
23  because they were crying out throwing their outer garments about and tossing dust into the air
24  the military commander ordered paul to be brought into the soldiers quarters and said that he should be interrogated under scourging so that he could learn exactly why they were shouting against paul this way
25  but when they had stretched him out for the whipping paul said to the army officer standing there is it lawful for you to scourge a roman who has not been condemned
26  well when the army officer heard this he went to the military commander and reported it saying what are you intending to do for this man is a roman
27  so the military commander approached and said to him tell me are you a roman he said yes
28  the military commander responded i purchased these rights as a citizen for a large sum of money
paul said but i have them by birth
29  immediately therefore the men who were about to interrogate him under torture backed away from him and the military commander became afraid when he realized that he was a roman and that he had bound him in chains
30  so the next day because he wanted to know for sure just why he was being accused by the jews he released him and commanded the chief priests and all the sanʹhedrin to assemble
he then brought paul down and had him stand among them
6  now in those days when the disciples were increasing the greekspeaking jews began complaining against the hebrewspeaking jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution
2  so the twelve called the multitude of the disciples together and said it is not right for us to leave the word of god to distribute food to tables
3  so brothers select for yourselves seven reputable men from among you full of spirit and wisdom that we may appoint them over this necessary matter
4  but we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word
5  what they said was pleasing to the whole multitude and they selected stephen a man full of faith and holy spirit as well as philip prochʹorus nicaʹnor tiʹmon parʹmenas and nicolaʹus a proselyte of antioch
6  they brought them to the apostles and after praying they laid their hands on them
7  consequently the word of god continued to spread and the number of the disciples kept multiplying very much in jerusalem and a large crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith
8  now stephen full of divine favor and power was performing great wonders and signs among the people
9  but some men of the socalled synagogue of the freedmen came forward along with some cyreʹnians and alexandrians and some from ciliʹcia and asia to dispute with stephen
10  but they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking
11  then they secretly persuaded men to say we have heard him speaking blasphemous things against moses and god
12  and they stirred up the people the elders and the scribes and coming upon him suddenly they forcibly seized him and led him to the sanʹhedrin
13  and they brought forward false witnesses who said this man does not stop speaking things against this holy place and against the law
14  for instance we have heard him say that this jesus the nazareneʹ will throw down this place and change the customs that moses handed down to us
15  and as all those sitting in the sanʹhedrin stared at him they saw that his face was like an angels face
21  after tearing ourselves away from them and putting out to sea we ran with a straight course and came to cos on the next day to rhodes and from there to patʹara
2  when we found a ship that was crossing to phoeniʹcia we went aboard and sailed away
3  after coming in sight of the island of cyʹprus we left it behind on the left side and sailed on to syria and landed at tyre where the ship was to unload its cargo
4  we searched for and found the disciples and remained there for seven days
but through the spirit they repeatedly told paul not to set foot in jerusalem
5  so when our time there was over we left and started on our way but they all together with the women and children accompanied us until we were outside the city
and kneeling down on the beach we prayed
6  and said goodbye to one another
then we went aboard the ship and they returned to their homes
7  we then completed the voyage from tyre and arrived at ptolemaʹis and we greeted the brothers and stayed one day with them
8  the next day we left and came to caesareʹa and we entered the house of philip the evangelizer who was one of the seven men and we stayed with him
9  this man had four unmarried daughters who prophesied
10  but after we had stayed there for quite a number of days a prophet named agʹabus came down from judeʹa
11  and he came to us and took pauls belt and tied his own feet and hands and said thus says the holy spirit the man to whom this belt belongs will be bound like this by the jews in jerusalem and they will give him into the hands of people of the nations
12  now when we heard this both we and those who were there began begging him not to go up to jerusalem
13  then paul answered what are you doing by weeping and trying to weaken my resolve rest assured i am ready not only to be bound but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
14  when he would not be dissuaded we stopped objecting and said let the will of jehovah take place
15  now after these days we prepared for the journey and started on our way to jerusalem
16  some of the disciples from caesareʹa also went with us taking us to mnaʹson of cyʹprus an early disciple at whose home we were to be guests
17  when we got to jerusalem the brothers welcomed us gladly
18  but on the following day paul went in with us to james and all the elders were present
19  and he greeted them and began giving a detailed account of the things god did among the nations through his ministry
20  after hearing this they began to glorify god but they said to him you see brother how many thousands of believers there are among the jews and they are all zealous for the law
21  but they have heard it rumored about you that you have been teaching all the jews among the nations an apostasy from moses telling them not to circumcise their children or to follow the customary practices
22  what then is to be done about it they are certainly going to hear that you have arrived
23  so do what we tell you we have four men who have put themselves under a vow
24  take these men with you and cleanse yourself ceremonially together with them and take care of their expenses so that they may have their heads shaved
then everyone will know that there is nothing to the rumors they were told about you but that you are walking orderly and you are also keeping the law
25  as for the believers from among the nations we have sent them our decision in writing that they should keep away from what is sacrificed to idols as well as from blood from what is strangled and from sexual immorality
26  then paul took the men the next day and cleansed himself ceremonially along with them and he went into the temple to give notice of when the days for the ceremonial cleansing would be completed and the offering should be presented for each one of them
27  now when the seven days were about to end the jews from asia on seeing him in the temple stirred up the whole crowd and they seized him
28  shouting men of israel help this is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place
and what is more he even brought greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place
29  for they had previously seen trophʹimus the epheʹsian in the city with him and they assumed that paul had brought him into the temple
30  the whole city was in an uproar and the people came running together and seized paul and dragged him outside the temple and immediately the doors were closed
31  while they were trying to kill him word reached the commander of the army unit that all jerusalem was in confusion
32  and he immediately took soldiers and army officers and ran down to them
when they caught sight of the military commander and the soldiers they stopped beating paul
33  then the military commander came near and took him into custody and ordered that he be bound with two chains then he inquired who he was and what he had done
34  but some in the crowd began shouting out one thing and others something else
so being unable himself to learn anything for certain because of the disturbance he commanded him to be brought to the soldiers quarters
35  but when he reached the stairs he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd
36  for a crowd of the people kept following crying out do away with him
37  as he was about to be led into the soldiers quarters paul said to the military commander am i allowed to say something to you he said can you speak greek
38  are you not then the egyptian who some time ago stirred up a sedition and led the 4000 dagger men out into the wilderness
39  then paul said i am in fact a jew of tarsus in ciliʹcia a citizen of no obscure city
so i beg you permit me to speak to the people
40  after he gave permission paul standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people
when a great silence fell he addressed them in the hebrew language saying
25  therefore festus after arriving in the province and taking charge went up three days later to jerusalem from caesareʹa
2  and the chief priests and the principal men of the jews gave him information against paul
so they began to beg festus
3  as a favor to send for paul to come to jerusalem
but they were planning to ambush paul and kill him along the road
4  however festus answered that paul was to be kept in caesareʹa and that he himself was about to go back there shortly
5  so let those who are in power among you he said come down with me and accuse him if indeed the man has done something wrong
6  so when he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them he went down to caesareʹa and the next day he sat down on the judgment seat and commanded paul to be brought in
7  when he came in the jews who had come down from jerusalem stood around him bringing against him many serious charges that they were unable to prove
8  but paul said in defense neither against the law of the jews nor against the temple nor against caesar have i committed any sin
9  festus desiring to gain favor with the jews said in reply to paul do you wish to go up to jerusalem and be judged before me there concerning these things
10  but paul said i am standing before the judgment seat of caesar where i ought to be judged
i have done no wrong to the jews of which you are also becoming wellaware
11  if i am really a wrongdoer and have committed anything deserving of death i do not beg off from dying but if there is no substance to the accusations these men have made against me no man has the right to hand me over to them as a favor
i appeal to caesar
12  then festus after speaking with the assembly of counselors replied to caesar you have appealed to caesar you will go
13  after some days had passed agripʹpa the king and bernice arrived in caesareʹa for a courtesy visit to festus
14  since they were spending a number of days there festus presented pauls case to the king saying there is a man who was left as a prisoner by felix
15  and when i was in jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews brought information about him asking for a judgment of condemnation against him
16  but i replied to them that it is not roman procedure to hand any man over as a favor before the accused man meets his accusers facetoface and gets a chance to speak in his defense concerning the complaint
17  so when they arrived here i did not delay but the next day i sat down on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in
18  taking the stand the accusers did not charge him with any of the wicked things i had expected concerning him
19  they simply had certain disputes with him concerning their own worship of the deity and concerning a man named jesus who was dead but who paul kept asserting was alive
20  being at a loss as to how to handle this dispute i asked if he would like to go to jerusalem and be judged there concerning these matters
21  but when paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision by the august one i commanded him to be held until i should send him on to caesar
22  agripʹpa then said to festus i would like to hear the man myself
tomorrow he said you will hear him
23  so the next day agripʹpa and bernice came with much pompous show and entered the audience chamber together with military commanders as well as the prominent men in the city and when festus gave the command paul was brought in
24  and festus said king agripʹpa and all you who are present with us you see this man about whom the whole jewish populace have petitioned me both in jerusalem and here shouting that he ought not to live any longer
25  but i perceived that he had done nothing deserving of death
so when this man himself appealed to the august one i decided to send him
26  but i have nothing certain to write about him to my lord
so i brought him before all of you and especially before you king agripʹpa so that after the judicial examination has taken place i might have something to write
27  for it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not also to indicate the charges against him
13  now in antioch there were prophets and teachers in the local congregation barʹnabas symʹeon who was called niʹger lucius of cyreʹne manʹaen who was educated with herod the district ruler and saul
2  as they were ministering to jehovah and fasting the holy spirit said set aside for me barʹnabas and saul for the work to which i have called them
3  then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off
4  so these men sent out by the holy spirit went down to seleuʹcia and from there they sailed away to cyʹprus
5  when they arrived in salʹamis they began proclaiming the word of god in the synagogues of the jews
they also had john as an attendant
6  when they had gone through the whole island as far as paʹphos they met up with a jewish man named barjeʹsus who was a sorcerer and a false prophet
7  he was with the proconsul sergius paulus an intelligent man
calling barʹnabas and saul to him this man was eager to hear the word of god
8  but elʹymas the sorcerer for that is how his name is translated began opposing them trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith
9  then saul also called paul becoming filled with holy spirit looked at him intently
10  and said o man full of every sort of fraud and every sort of villainy you son of the devil you enemy of everything righteous will you not quit distorting the right ways of jehovah
11  look jehovahs hand is upon you and you will be blind not seeing the sunlight for a time
instantly a thick mist and darkness fell on him and he went around trying to find someone to lead him by the hand
12  then the proconsul on seeing what had happened became a believer for he was astounded at the teaching of jehovah
13  now paul and his companions put out to sea from paʹphos and arrived at perga in pamphylʹia
but john left them and returned to jerusalem
14  however they went on from perga and came to antioch in pisidʹia
and going into the synagogue on the sabbath day they took a seat
15  after the public reading of the law and the prophets the presiding officers of the synagogue sent word to them saying men brothers if you have any word of encouragement for the people tell it
16  so paul stood up and motioning with his hand he said men israelites and you others who fear god listen
17  the god of this people israel chose our forefathers and he exalted the people while they lived as foreigners in the land of egypt and brought them out of it with an uplifted arm
18  and for a period of about 40 years he put up with them in the wilderness
19  after destroying seven nations in the land of caʹnaan he assigned their land as an inheritance
20  all of that was during about 450 years
after this he gave them judges until samuel the prophet
21  but afterward they demanded a king and god gave them saul the son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin for 40 years
22  after removing him he raised up for them david as king about whom he bore witness and said i have found david the son of jesʹse a man agreeable to my heart he will do all the things i desire
23  according to his promise from the offspring of this man god has brought to israel a savior jesus
24  before the arrival of that one john had preached publicly to all the people of israel baptism in symbol of repentance
25  but as john was finishing his course he would say what do you suppose i am i am not he
but look one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet i am not worthy to untie
26  men brothers you descendants of abrahams family and those others among you who fear god the word of this salvation has been sent to us
27  for the inhabitants of jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize this one but when acting as judges they fulfilled the things spoken by the prophets which are read aloud every sabbath
28  even though they found no cause for death they demanded of pilate to have him executed
29  and when they had accomplished all the things written about him they took him down from the stake and laid him in a tomb
30  but god raised him up from the dead
31  and for many days he became visible to those who had gone with him from galʹilee up to jerusalem
these are now his witnesses to the people
32  so we are declaring to you the good news about the promise made to the forefathers
33  god has completely fulfilled it to us their children by resurrecting jesus just as it is written in the second psalm you are my son today i have become your father
34  and the fact that he resurrected him from the dead never again to return to corruption he has stated in this way i will give you the expressions of loyal love promised to david which are faithful
35  so it also says in another psalm you will not allow your loyal one to see corruption
36  david on the one hand rendered service to god in his own generation fell asleep in death was laid with his forefathers and did see corruption
37  on the other hand the one whom god raised up did not see corruption
38  let it therefore be known to you brothers that through this one a forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you
39  and that from all the things from which you could not be declared guiltless by means of the law of moses everyone who believes is declared guiltless by means of this one
40  therefore watch out that what is said in the prophets does not come upon you
41  look at it you scorners and be amazed and perish for i am doing a work in your days a work that you will never believe even if anyone relates it to you in detail
42  now when they were going out the people pleaded with them to speak about these matters on the following sabbath
43  so after the synagogue assembly was dismissed many of the jews and the proselytes who worshipped god followed paul and barʹnabas who as they spoke to them urged them to remain in the undeserved kindness of god
44  the next sabbath nearly all the city gathered together to hear the word of jehovah
45  when the jews saw the crowds they were filled with jealousy and began blasphemously contradicting the things paul was saying
46  then paul and barʹnabas boldly said to them it was necessary for the word of god to be spoken first to you
since you are rejecting it and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life look we turn to the nations
47  for jehovah has commanded us in these words i have appointed you as a light of nations for you to be a salvation to the ends of the earth
48  when those of the nations heard this they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of jehovah and all those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers
49  furthermore the word of jehovah was being spread throughout the whole country
50  but the jews incited the prominent women who were godfearing and the principal men of the city and they stirred up persecution against paul and barʹnabas and threw them outside their boundaries
51  so they shook the dust off their feet against them and went to icoʹnium
52  and the disciples continued to be filled with joy and holy spirit
14  now in icoʹnium they entered together into the synagogue of the jews and spoke in such a manner that a great multitude of both jews and greeks became believers
2  but the jews who did not believe stirred up and wrongly influenced the people of the nations against the brothers
3  so they spent considerable time speaking with boldness by the authority of jehovah who bore witness to the word of his undeserved kindness by allowing signs and wonders to be performed through them
4  however the multitude of the city was divided some were for the jews but others for the apostles
5  when both the people of the nations and the jews with their rulers made an attempt to treat them insolently and stone them
6  they were informed of it and they fled to the cities of lycaoʹnia lysʹtra and derʹbe and to the surrounding country
7  there they went on declaring the good news
8  now in lysʹtra there was a man sitting down whose feet were crippled
he was lame from birth and had never walked
9  this man was listening to paul as he was speaking
paul looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well
10  said with a loud voice stand up on your feet
so the man leaped up and began walking
11  when the crowds saw what paul had done they cried out in the lycaoʹnian language the gods have become like humans and have come down to us
12  and they started calling barʹnabas zeus but paul herʹmes since he was taking the lead in speaking
13  and the priest of zeus whose temple was at the entrance of the city brought bulls and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifices with the crowds
14  however when the apostles barʹnabas and paul heard of it they ripped their garments and leaped out into the crowd and cried out
15  men why are you doing these things we too are humans having the same infirmities as you have
and we are declaring the good news to you for you to turn from these vain things to the living god who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them
16  in past generations he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways
17  although he did not leave himself without witness in that he did good giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness
18  and yet despite saying these things they barely restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them
19  but jews arrived from antioch and icoʹnium and persuaded the crowds and they stoned paul and dragged him outside the city imagining that he was dead
20  however when the disciples surrounded him he got up and entered the city
on the next day he left with barʹnabas for derʹbe
21  after declaring the good news to that city and making quite a few disciples they returned to lysʹtra icoʹnium and antioch
22  there they strengthened the disciples encouraging them to remain in the faith and saying we must enter into the kingdom of god through many tribulations
23  moreover they appointed elders for them in each congregation offering prayer with fasting and they entrusted them to jehovah in whom they had become believers
24  then they went through pisidʹia and came into pamphylʹia
25  and after proclaiming the word in perga they went down to attaliʹa
26  from there they sailed off for antioch where they had been entrusted to the undeserved kindness of god for the work they had now completed
27  when they had arrived and had gathered the congregation together they related the many things god had done by means of them and that he had opened to the nations the door to faith
28  so they spent considerable time with the disciples
19  in the course of events while apolʹlos was in corinth paul went through the inland regions and came down to ephʹesus
there he found some disciples
2  and said to them did you receive holy spirit when you became believers they replied to him why we have never heard that there is a holy spirit
3  so he said in what then were you baptized they said in johns baptism
4  paul said john baptized with the baptism in symbol of repentance telling the people to believe in the one coming after him that is in jesus
5  on hearing this they got baptized in the name of the lord jesus
6  and when paul laid his hands on them the holy spirit came upon them and they began speaking in foreign languages and prophesying
7  there were about 12 men in all
8  entering the synagogue for three months he spoke with boldness giving talks and reasoning persuasively about the kingdom of god
9  but when some stubbornly refused to believe speaking injuriously about the way before the crowd he withdrew from them and separated the disciples from them giving talks daily in the school auditorium of tyranʹnus
10  this went on for two years so that all those living in the province of asia heard the word of the lord both jews and greeks
11  and god kept performing extraordinary powerful works through the hands of paul
12  so that even cloths and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick and the diseases left them and the wicked spirits came out
13  but some of the jews who traveled around casting out demons also tried to use the name of the lord jesus over those who had wicked spirits they would say i solemnly charge you by jesus whom paul preaches
14  now there were seven sons of a jewish chief priest named sceʹva doing this
15  but in answer the wicked spirit said to them i know jesus and i am acquainted with paul but who are you
16  at that the man with the wicked spirit leaped on them overpowered them one after the other and prevailed against them so that they fled naked and wounded out of that house
17  this became known to all both the jews and the greeks who lived in ephʹesus and fear fell upon them all and the name of the lord jesus went on being magnified
18  and many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly
19  indeed quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody
and they calculated their value and found them worth 50000 pieces of silver
20  thus in a mighty way the word of jehovah kept growing and prevailing
21  after these things had taken place paul resolved in his spirit that after going through macedoʹnia and achaʹia he would travel to jerusalem
he said after going there i must also see rome
22  so he sent to macedoʹnia two of those who ministered to him timothy and erasʹtus but he himself stayed on for some time in the province of asia
23  at that time quite a disturbance arose concerning the way
24  for a man named demeʹtrius a silversmith who made silver shrines of arʹtemis brought considerable profit to the craftsmen
25  he gathered them and others who worked at such things and said men you well know that from this business comes our prosperity
26  now you see and hear how not only in ephʹesus but in nearly all the province of asia this paul has persuaded a considerable crowd and turned them to another opinion saying that the gods made by hands are not really gods
27  moreover the danger exists not only that this business of ours will come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess arʹtemis will be viewed as nothing and she who is worshipped in the whole province of asia and the inhabited earth will be deprived of her magnificence
28  hearing this and becoming full of anger the men began crying out great is arʹtemis of the epheʹsians
29  so the city became filled with confusion and all together they rushed into the theater dragging along with them gaʹius and aristarʹchus macedoʹnians traveling companions of paul
30  for his part paul was willing to go inside to the people but the disciples would not permit him
31  even some of the commissioners of festivals and games who were friendly to him sent word to him pleading with him not to risk going into the theater
32  some were in fact crying out one thing and others something else for the assembly was in confusion and the majority of them did not know the reason why they had come together
33  so they brought alexander out of the crowd the jews shoving him forward and alexander motioned with his hand and wanted to make his defense to the people
34  but when they recognized that he was a jew they all started shouting in unison for about two hours great is arʹtemis of the epheʹsians
35  when the city recorder had finally quieted the crowd he said men of ephʹesus who really is there among men who does not know that the city of the epheʹsians is the temple keeper of the great arʹtemis and of the image that fell from heaven
36  since these things are indisputable you should keep calm and not act rashly
37  for you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess
38  so if demeʹtrius and the craftsmen with him do have a case against someone court days are held and there are proconsuls let them bring charges against one another
39  but if you are searching for anything beyond that it must be decided in a regular assembly
40  for we are really in danger of being charged with sedition over todays affair since there are no grounds we could present as a reason for this disorderly mob
41  and after saying this he dismissed the assembly
24  five days later the high priest ananiʹas came down with some elders and a public speaker named tertulʹlus and they presented their case against paul to the governor
2  when he was called tertulʹlus started accusing him saying seeing that we enjoy great peace through you and that through your forethought reforms are taking place in this nation
3  at all times and also in all places we acknowledge this your excellency felix with the greatest thankfulness
4  but that i may not detain you any further i beg you to hear us briefly in your kindness
5  for we have found this man to be a pest stirring up seditions among all the jews throughout the inhabited earth and he is a spearhead of the sect of the nazarenesʹ
6  he also tried to profane the temple so we seized him
7  
8  when you examine him yourself you will find out about all these things of which we are accusing him
9  with that the jews also joined in the attack asserting that these things were true
10  when the governor nodded to paul to speak he answered knowing well that this nation has had you as judge for many years i readily speak in my own defense
11  as you can verify for yourself it has not been more than 12 days since i went up to worship in jerusalem
12  and they found me neither arguing with anyone in the temple nor stirring up a mob either in the synagogues or throughout the city
13  nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of right now
14  but i do admit this to you that according to the way that they call a sect in this manner i am rendering sacred service to the god of my forefathers as i believe all the things set forth in the law and written in the prophets
15  and i have hope toward god which hope these men also look forward to that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous
16  because of this i always strive to maintain a clear conscience before god and men
17  now after quite a number of years i arrived to bring gifts of mercy to my nation and to make offerings
18  while i was caring for these matters they found me ceremonially cleansed in the temple but not with a crowd or causing a disturbance
but there were some jews from the province of asia
19  who ought to be present before you to accuse me if they actually have anything against me
20  or let the men here say for themselves what wrong they found as i stood before the sanʹhedrin
21  except for this one thing that i cried out while standing among them over the resurrection of the dead i am today being judged before you
22  however felix knowing quite well the facts concerning this way began to put them off and say whenever lysʹias the military commander comes down i will decide these matters involving you
23  and he gave orders to the army officer that the man be kept under arrest but given some freedom and that his people be allowed to attend to his needs
24  some days later felix came with drusilʹla his wife who was jewish and he sent for paul and listened to him speak about the belief in christ jesus
25  but as paul talked about righteousness and selfcontrol and the judgment to come felix became frightened and answered go away for now but when i have an opportunity i will send for you again
26  at the same time he was hoping that paul would give him money
for that reason he sent for him even more frequently and conversed with him
27  but when two years had elapsed felix was succeeded by porcius festus and because felix desired to gain favor with the jews he left paul in custody
5  however a man named ananiʹas together with his wife sapphiʹra sold some property
2  but he secretly held back some of the price with his wifes knowledge and he brought just a part of it and deposited it at the feet of the apostles
3  but peter said ananiʹas why has satan emboldened you to lie to the holy spirit and secretly hold back some of the price of the field
4  as long as it remained with you did it not remain yours and after it was sold was it not in your control why have you thought up such a deed as this in your heart you have lied not to men but to god
5  on hearing these words ananiʹas collapsed and died
and great fear came over all those who heard about it
6  then the younger men rose wrapped him in cloths carried him out and buried him
7  now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in not knowing what had happened
8  peter said to her tell me did you two sell the field for so much she said yes for that amount
9  so peter said to her why did you two agree to make a test of the spirit of jehovah look the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out
10  instantly she collapsed at his feet and died
when the young men came in they found her dead and they carried her out and buried her alongside her husband
11  so great fear came over the whole congregation and over all those hearing about these things
12  moreover through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders continued to occur among the people and they would all meet together in solʹomons colonnade
13  true none of the others had the courage to join them nevertheless the people were speaking highly of them
14  more than that believers in the lord kept on being added great numbers both of men and of women
15  they even brought the sick out into the main streets and laid them there on small beds and mats so that as peter would pass by at least his shadow might fall on some of them
16  also crowds of people from the cities around jerusalem kept coming carrying sick people and those troubled with unclean spirits and they were one and all cured
17  but the high priest rose and all those with him who were of the sect of the sadducees and they were filled with jealousy
18  and they seized the apostles and put them in the public jail
19  but during the night jehovahs angel opened the doors of the prison brought them out and said
20  go and take your stand in the temple and keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life
21  after hearing this they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach
now when the high priest and those with him arrived they called together the sanʹhedrin and the entire assembly of elders of the sons of israel and they sent out to the jail to have the apostles brought before them
22  but when the officers got there they did not find them in the prison
so they returned and made their report
23  saying we found the jail locked and secure and the guards were standing at the doors but on opening it up we found no one inside
24  well when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words they were perplexed about what would come of this
25  but someone came and reported to them look the men you put in prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people
26  then the captain went off with his officers and brought them in but without violence because they were afraid of being stoned by the people
27  so they brought them and stood them before the sanʹhedrin
then the high priest questioned them
28  and said we strictly ordered you not to keep teaching on the basis of this name and yet look you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring the blood of this man upon us
29  in answer peter and the other apostles said we must obey god as ruler rather than men
30  the god of our forefathers raised up jesus whom you killed hanging him on a stake
31  god exalted this one as chief agent and savior to his right hand to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
32  and we are witnesses of these matters and so is the holy spirit which god has given to those obeying him as ruler
33  when they heard this they were infuriated and wanted to do away with them
34  but a pharisee named gamaʹliel rose in the sanʹhedrin he was a law teacher esteemed by all the people and he gave the command to put the men outside for a little while
35  then he said to them men of israel be careful as to what you intend to do about these men
36  for instance before these days theuʹdas rose up saying he himself was somebody and a number of men about 400 joined his party
but he was done away with and all those who were following him were dispersed and came to nothing
37  after him judas the galileʹan rose up in the days of the registration and he drew followers after himself
that man also perished and all those who were following him were scattered
38  so under the present circumstances i say to you do not meddle with these men but let them alone
for if this scheme or this work is from men it will be overthrown
39  but if it is from god you will not be able to overthrow them
otherwise you may even be found fighters against god himself
40  at this they took his advice and they summoned the apostles flogged them and ordered them to stop speaking on the basis of jesus name and let them go
41  so they went out from before the sanʹhedrin rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name
42  and every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the christ jesus
15  now some men came down from judeʹa and began to teach the brothers unless you get circumcised according to the custom of moses you cannot be saved
2  but after quite a bit of dissension and disputing by paul and barʹnabas with them it was arranged for paul barʹnabas and some of the others to go up to the apostles and elders in jerusalem regarding this issue
3  so after being escorted partway by the congregation these men continued on through both phoeniʹcia and samarʹia relating in detail the conversion of people of the nations and bringing great joy to all the brothers
4  on arriving in jerusalem they were kindly received by the congregation and the apostles and the elders and they related the many things god had done by means of them
5  but some of those of the sect of the pharisees who had become believers stood up from their seats and said it is necessary to circumcise them and command them to observe the law of moses
6  so the apostles and the elders gathered together to look into this matter
7  after much intense discussion had taken place peter rose and said to them men brothers you well know that from early days god made the choice among you that through my mouth people of the nations should hear the word of the good news and believe
8  and god who knows the heart bore witness by giving them the holy spirit just as he did to us also
9  and he made no distinction at all between us and them but purified their hearts by faith
10  so why are you now making a test of god by imposing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our forefathers nor we were capable of bearing
11  on the contrary we have faith that we are saved through the undeserved kindness of the lord jesus in the same way that they are
12  at that the entire group became silent and they began to listen to barʹnabas and paul relate the many signs and wonders that god had done through them among the nations
13  after they finished speaking james replied men brothers hear me
14  symʹeon has related thoroughly how god for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name
15  and with this the words of the prophets agree just as it is written
16  after these things i will return and raise up again the tent of david that is fallen down i will rebuild its ruins and restore it
17  so that the men who remain may earnestly seek jehovah together with people of all the nations people who are called by my name says jehovah who is doing these things
18  known from of old
19  therefore my decision is not to trouble those from the nations who are turning to god
20  but to write them to abstain from things polluted by idols from sexual immorality from what is strangled and from blood
21  for from ancient times moses has had those who preach him in city after city because he is read aloud in the synagogues on every sabbath
22  then the apostles and the elders together with the whole congregation decided to send chosen men from among them to antioch along with paul and barʹnabas they sent judas who was called barʹsabbas and silas who were leading men among the brothers
23  they wrote this and sent it through them the apostles and the elders your brothers to those brothers in antioch syria and ciliʹcia who are from the nations greetings
24  since we have heard that some went out from among us and caused you trouble with what they have said trying to subvert you although we did not give them any instructions
25  we have come to a unanimous decision to choose men to send to you together with our beloved barʹnabas and paul
26  men who have given up their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
27  we are therefore sending judas and silas so that they also may report the same things by word of mouth
28  for the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things
29  to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols from blood from what is strangled and from sexual immorality
if you carefully keep yourselves from these things you will prosper
good health to you
30  so when these men were dismissed they went down to antioch and they gathered the whole group together and handed them the letter
31  after reading it they rejoiced over the encouragement
32  and judas and silas since they were also prophets encouraged the brothers with many talks and strengthened them
33  after they had spent some time there they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them
34  
35  but paul and barʹnabas stayed in antioch teaching and declaring along with many others the good news of the word of jehovah
36  after some days paul said to barʹnabas let us now return and visit the brothers in every one of the cities where we proclaimed the word of jehovah to see how they are
37  barʹnabas was determined to take along john who was called mark
38  paul however was not in favor of taking him along with them seeing that he had departed from them in pamphylʹia and had not gone with them to the work
39  at this there was a sharp burst of anger so that they separated from each other and barʹnabas took mark along and sailed away to cyʹprus
40  paul selected silas and departed after he had been entrusted by the brothers to the undeserved kindness of jehovah
41  he went through syria and ciliʹcia strengthening the congregations
20  when the uproar had subsided paul sent for the disciples and after he had encouraged them and said farewell he began his journey to macedoʹnia
2  after going through those regions and giving many words of encouragement to the ones there he arrived in greece
3  he spent three months there but because a plot was hatched against him by the jews when he was about to set sail for syria he made up his mind to return through macedoʹnia
4  he was accompanied by sopʹater the son of pyrʹrhus of beroeʹa aristarʹchus and secunʹdus of the thessaloʹnians gaʹius of derʹbe timothy and from the province of asia tychʹicus and trophʹimus
5  these men went on ahead and were waiting for us in troʹas
6  but we put out to sea from philipʹpi after the days of the unleavened bread and within five days we came to them in troʹas and there we spent seven days
7  on the first day of the week when we were gathered together to have a meal paul began addressing them as he was going to depart the next day and he prolonged his speech until midnight
8  so there were quite a few lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together
9  seated at the window a young man named euʹtychus sank into a deep sleep while paul kept talking and overcome by sleep he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead
10  but paul went downstairs threw himself on him and embraced him and said stop making a commotion for he is alive
11  he then went upstairs and began the meal and ate
he continued conversing for quite a while until daybreak and then he departed
12  so they took the boy away alive and were comforted beyond measure
13  we now went ahead to the ship and set sail for asʹsos where we were intending to take paul aboard for after giving instructions to this effect he was intending to go there on foot
14  so when he caught up with us in asʹsos we took him aboard and went to mityleʹne
15  and sailing away from there the next day we arrived off chiʹos but the day after that we touched at saʹmos and on the following day we arrived at mileʹtus
16  paul had decided to sail past ephʹesus so as not to spend any time in the province of asia for he was hurrying to get to jerusalem on the day of the festival of pentecost if he possibly could
17  however from mileʹtus he sent word to ephʹesus and called for the elders of the congregation
18  when they came to him he said to them you well know how i conducted myself among you from the first day i stepped into the province of asia
19  slaving for the lord with all humility and with tears and trials that befell me by the plots of the jews
20  while i did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house
21  but i thoroughly bore witness both to jews and to greeks about repentance toward god and faith in our lord jesus
22  and now look bound in the spirit i am traveling to jerusalem although not knowing what will happen to me there
23  except that from city to city the holy spirit repeatedly bears witness to me saying that imprisonment and tribulations are waiting for me
24  nevertheless i do not consider my own life of any importance to me if only i may finish my course and the ministry that i received from the lord jesus to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of god
25  and now look i know that none of you among whom i preached the kingdom will ever see my face again
26  so i call you to witness this very day that i am clean from the blood of all men
27  for i have not held back from telling you all the counsel of god
28  pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers to shepherd the congregation of god which he purchased with the blood of his own son
29  i know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness
30  and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
31  therefore keep awake and bear in mind that for three years night and day i never stopped admonishing each one of you with tears
32  and now i entrust you to god and to the word of his undeserved kindness which word can build you up and give you the inheritance among all the sanctified ones
33  i have desired no mans silver or gold or clothing
34  you yourselves know that these hands have provided for my own needs and the needs of those with me
35  i have shown you in all things that by working hard in this way you must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the lord jesus when he himself said there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving
36  and when he had said these things he knelt down with all of them and prayed
37  indeed quite a bit of weeping broke out among them all and they embraced paul and affectionately kissed him
38  for they were especially pained at the word he had spoken that they would not see his face anymore
then they accompanied him to the ship
1  the first account o theophʹilus i composed about all the things jesus started to do and to teach
2  until the day that he was taken up after he had given instructions through holy spirit to the apostles he had chosen
3  after he had suffered he showed himself alive to them by many convincing proofs
he was seen by them throughout 40 days and he was speaking about the kingdom of god
4  while he was meeting with them he ordered them do not leave jerusalem but keep waiting for what the father has promised about which you heard from me
5  for john indeed baptized with water but you will be baptized with holy spirit not many days after this
6  so when they had assembled they asked him lord are you restoring the kingdom to israel at this time
7  he said to them it does not belong to you to know the times or seasons that the father has placed in his own jurisdiction
8  but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be witnesses of me in jerusalem in all judeʹa and samarʹia and to the most distant part of the earth
9  after he had said these things while they were looking on he was lifted up and a cloud caught him up from their sight
10  and as they were gazing into the sky while he was on his way suddenly two men in white garments stood beside them
11  and said men of galʹilee why do you stand looking into the sky this jesus who was taken up from you into the sky will come in the same manner as you have seen him going into the sky
12  then they returned to jerusalem from a mountain called the mount of olives which is near jerusalem only a sabbath days journey away
13  when they arrived they went up into the upper room where they were staying
there were peter as well as john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholʹomew and matthew james the son of alphaeʹus and simon the zealous one and judas the son of james
14  with one purpose all of these were persisting in prayer together with some women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brothers
15  during those days peter stood up in the midst of the brothers the number of people was altogether about 120 and said
16  men brothers it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the holy spirit spoke prophetically through david about judas who became a guide to those who arrested jesus
17  for he had been numbered among us and he obtained a share in this ministry
18  this very man therefore purchased a field with the wages for unrighteousness and falling headfirst his body burst open and all his insides spilled out
19  this became known to all the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the field was called in their language akelʹdama that is field of blood
20  for it is written in the book of psalms let his dwelling become desolate and let there be no inhabitant in it and his office of oversight let someone else take
21  it is therefore necessary that of the men who accompanied us during all the time in which the lord jesus carried on his activities among us
22  starting with his baptism by john until the day he was taken up from us one of these men should become a witness with us of his resurrection
23  so they proposed two joseph called barʹsabbas who was also called justus and matthiʹas
24  then they prayed and said you o jehovah who know the hearts of all designate which one of these two men you have chosen
25  to take the place of this ministry and apostleship from which judas deviated to go to his own place
26  so they cast lots over them and the lot fell to matthiʹas and he was counted along with the 11 apostles
2  now while the day of the festival of pentecost was in progress they were all together at the same place
2  suddenly there was a noise from heaven just like that of a rushing stiff breeze and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
3  and tongues as if of fire became visible to them and were distributed and one came to rest on each one of them
4  and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak in different languages just as the spirit enabled them to speak
5  at that time devout jews from every nation under heaven were staying in jerusalem
6  so when this sound occurred a crowd gathered and was bewildered because each one heard them speaking in his own language
7  indeed they were utterly amazed and said see here all these who are speaking are galileʹans are they not
8  how is it then that each one of us is hearing his own native language
9  parʹthians medes and eʹlamites the inhabitants of mesopotaʹmia judeʹa and cappadoʹcia ponʹtus and the province of asia
10  phrygʹia and pamphylʹia egypt and the regions of libʹya near cyreʹne sojourners from rome both jews and proselytes
11  creʹtans and arabianswe hear them speaking in our languages about the magnificent things of god
12  yes they were all astonished and perplexed saying to one another what does this mean
13  however others mocked them and said they are full of sweet wine
14  but peter stood up with the eleven and spoke to them in a loud voice men of judeʹa and all you inhabitants of jerusalem let this be known to you and listen carefully to my words
15  these people are in fact not drunk as you suppose for it is the third hour of the day
16  on the contrary this is what was said through the prophet joel
17  and in the last days god says i will pour out some of my spirit on every sort of flesh and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams
18  and even on my male slaves and on my female slaves i will pour out some of my spirit in those days and they will prophesy
19  and i will give wonders in heaven above and signs on earth belowblood and fire and clouds of smoke
20  the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and illustrious day of jehovah comes
21  and everyone who calls on the name of jehovah will be saved
22  men of israel hear these words jesus the nazareneʹ was a man publicly shown to you by god through powerful works and wonders and signs that god did through him in your midst just as you yourselves know
23  this man who was handed over by the determined will and foreknowledge of god you fastened to a stake by the hand of lawless men and you did away with him
24  but god resurrected him by releasing him from the pangs of death because it was not possible for him to be held fast by it
25  for david says about him i keep jehovah constantly in front of me for he is at my right hand that i may never be shaken
26  on this account my heart became cheerful and my tongue rejoiced greatly
and i will reside in hope
27  because you will not leave me in the grave nor will you allow your loyal one to see corruption
28  you have made lifes ways known to me you will fill me with great joy in your presence
29  men brothers it is permissible to speak with freeness of speech to you about the family head david that he died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day
30  because he was a prophet and knew that god had sworn to him with an oath that he would seat one of his offspring on his throne
31  he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the christ that neither was he forsaken in the grave nor did his flesh see corruption
32  god resurrected this jesus and of this we are all witnesses
33  therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of god and received the promised holy spirit from the father he has poured out what you see and hear
34  for david did not ascend to the heavens but he himself says jehovah said to my lord sit at my right hand
35  until i place your enemies as a stool for your feet
36  therefore let all the house of israel know for a certainty that god made him both lord and christ this jesus whom you executed on a stake
37  now when they heard this they were stabbed to the heart and they said to peter and the rest of the apostles men brothers what should we do
38  peter said to them repent and let each one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit
39  for the promise is to you and your children and to all those who are far away to all those whom jehovah our god may call to himself
40  and with many other words he gave a thorough witness and kept exhorting them saying get saved from this crooked generation
41  so those who gladly accepted his word were baptized and on that day about 3000 people were added
42  and they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles to associating together to the taking of meals and to prayers
43  indeed fear began to fall upon everyone and many wonders and signs began to occur through the apostles
44  all those who became believers were together and had everything in common
45  and they were selling their possessions and properties and distributing the proceeds to all according to what each one needed
46  and day after day they were in constant attendance in the temple with a united purpose and they took their meals in different homes and shared their food with great rejoicing and sincerity of heart
47  praising god and finding favor with all the people
at the same time jehovah continued to add to them daily those being saved
3  now peter and john were going up into the temple for the hour of prayer the ninth hour
2  and a man who was lame from birth was being carried
every day they would put him near the temple door that was called beautiful so he could ask for gifts of mercy from those entering the temple
3  when he caught sight of peter and john about to go into the temple he began asking for gifts of mercy
4  but peter together with john looked straight at him and said look at us
5  so he fixed his attention on them expecting to get something from them
6  however peter said silver and gold i do not possess but what i do have is what i give you
in the name of jesus christ the nazareneʹ walk
7  with that he took hold of him by the right hand and raised him up
instantly his feet and his ankles were made firm
8  and leaping to his feet he began walking and went with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god
9  and all the people saw him walking and praising god
10  and they began to recognize him that this was the man who used to sit waiting for gifts of mercy at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were completely astonished and ecstatic about what had happened to him
11  while the man was still holding on to peter and john all the people ran together to them at what was called solʹomons colonnade completely surprised
12  when peter saw this he said to the people men of israel why are you so amazed at this and why are you staring at us as though by personal power or godly devotion we have made him walk
13  the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our forefathers has glorified his servant jesus whom you handed over and disowned before pilate even though he had decided to release him
14  yes you disowned that holy and righteous one and you asked for a man who was a murderer to be given to you
15  whereas you killed the chief agent of life
but god raised him up from the dead of which fact we are witnesses
16  and through his name and by our faith in his name this man whom you see and know has been made strong
the faith that is through him has made this man completely healthy in front of all of you
17  and now brothers i know that you acted in ignorance just as your rulers also did
18  but in this way god has fulfilled the things he announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets that his christ would suffer
19  repent therefore and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out so that seasons of refreshing may come from jehovah himself
20  and he may send the christ appointed for you jesus
21  heaven must hold this one within itself until the times of restoration of all things of which god spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old
22  in fact moses said jehovah your god will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me
you must listen to whatever he tells you
23  indeed anyone who does not listen to that prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people
24  and all the prophets from samuel and those who followed him as many as have spoken have also plainly declared these days
25  you are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that god made with your forefathers saying to abraham and by means of your offspring all the families of the earth will be blessed
26  god after raising up his servant sent him to you first to bless you by turning each one of you away from your wicked deeds
12  about that time herod the king began mistreating some of those of the congregation
2  he put james the brother of john to death by the sword
3  when he saw that it was pleasing to the jews he also went on to arrest peter
this was during the days of the unleavened bread
4  he seized him and put him in prison turning him over to four shifts of four soldiers each to guard him intending to bring him out before the people after the passover
5  so peter was being kept in the prison but the congregation was intensely praying to god for him
6  when herod was about to bring him out that night peter was sleeping bound with two chains between two soldiers and guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison
7  but look jehovahs angel was standing there and a light shone in the prison cell
hitting peter on the side he woke him saying get up quickly and the chains fell off his hands
8  the angel said to him get dressed and put on your sandals
he did so
finally he said to him put your outer garment on and keep following me
9  and he went out and kept following him but he did not know that what was happening through the angel was real
in fact he thought he was seeing a vision
10  going past the first sentinel guard and the second they reached the iron gate leading into the city and this opened to them by itself
after they went out they made their way down one street and immediately the angel departed from him
11  and peter realizing what was happening said now i know for sure that jehovah sent his angel and rescued me from herods hand and from everything that the jews were expecting to happen
12  after he realized this he went to the house of mary the mother of john who was called mark where quite a few were gathered together and were praying
13  when he knocked at the door of the gateway a servant girl named rhoda came to answer the call
14  on recognizing the voice of peter she was so overjoyed that she did not open the gate but ran inside and reported that peter was standing at the gateway
15  they said to her you are out of your mind
but she kept insisting that it was so
they began to say it is his angel
16  but peter remained there knocking
when they opened the door they saw him and were astonished
17  but he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and told them in detail how jehovah had brought him out of the prison and he said report these things to james and the brothers
with that he went out and traveled to another place
18  now when it became day there was quite a disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of peter
19  herod made a diligent search for him and not finding him he interrogated the guards and commanded them to be led off to punishment and he went down from judeʹa to caesareʹa and spent some time there
20  now he was in an angry mood against the people of tyre and siʹdon
so they came to him with one purpose and after persuading blastus the man in charge of the kings household affairs they sued for peace because their country was supplied with food from the land of the king
21  on a set day herod clothed himself with royal raiment and sat down on the judgment seat and began giving them a public address
22  then the people who were assembled began shouting a gods voice and not a mans
23  instantly the angel of jehovah struck him because he did not give the glory to god and he was eaten up with worms and died
24  but the word of jehovah went on growing and spreading
25  as for barʹnabas and saul after fully carrying out the relief work in jerusalem they returned and took along with them john the one also called mark
