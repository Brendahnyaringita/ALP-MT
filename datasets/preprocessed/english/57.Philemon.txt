1  paul a prisoner for the sake of christ jesus and timothy our brother to phileʹmon our beloved fellow worker
2  and to apʹphia our sister and to archipʹpus our fellow soldier and to the congregation that is in your house
3  may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
4  i always thank my god when i mention you in my prayers
5  as i keep hearing of your faith and the love that you have for the lord jesus and for all the holy ones
6  i pray that your sharing in the faith may move you to acknowledge every good thing that we have through christ
7  for i received much joy and comfort on hearing of your love because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed through you brother
8  for this very reason though i have great freeness of speech in connection with christ to order you to do what is proper
9  i would rather appeal to you on the basis of love seeing that i am paul an older man yes now also a prisoner for the sake of christ jesus
10  i am appealing to you for my child whose father i became while in prison onesʹimus
11  he was formerly useless to you but now he is useful to you and to me
12  i am sending him back to you yes him my very own heart
13  i would like to keep him here for myself so that he might take your place in ministering to me during my imprisonment for the sake of the good news
14  but i do not want to do anything without your consent so that your good deed may be done not under compulsion but of your own free will
15  perhaps this is really why he broke away for a short while so that you may have him back forever
16  no longer as a slave but as more than a slave as a brother who is beloved especially so to me but how much more so to you both in the flesh and in the lord
17  so if you consider me a friend receive him kindly the same way you would me
18  moreover if he did you any wrong or owes you anything charge it to my account
19  i paul am writing with my own hand i will pay it backnot to mention that you owe me even your own self
20  yes brother may i receive this assistance from you in connection with the lord refresh my heart in connection with christ
21  i am confident that you will comply so i am writing you knowing that you will do even more than what i say
22  but along with that also prepare a place for me to stay for i am hoping that through your prayers i will be given back to you
23  sending you greetings is epʹaphras my fellow captive in union with christ jesus
24  also mark aristarʹchus deʹmas and luke my fellow workers
25  the undeserved kindness of the lord jesus christ be with the spirit you show
