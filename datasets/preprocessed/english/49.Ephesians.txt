4  therefore i the prisoner in the lord appeal to you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called
2  with all humility and mildness with patience putting up with one another in love
3  earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace
4  one body there is and one spirit just as you were called to the one hope of your calling
5  one lord one faith one baptism
6  one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all
7  now undeserved kindness was given to each one of us according to how the christ measured out the free gift
8  for it says when he ascended on high he carried away captives he gave gifts in men
9  now what does the expression he ascended mean but that he also descended into the lower regions that is the earth
10  the very one who descended is also the one who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might give fullness to all things
11  and he gave some as apostles some as prophets some as evangelizers some as shepherds and teachers
12  with a view to the readjustment of the holy ones for ministerial work to build up the body of the christ
13  until we all attain to the oneness of the faith and of the accurate knowledge of the son of god to being a fullgrown man attaining the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the christ
14  so we should no longer be children tossed about as by waves and carried here and there by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men by means of cunning in deceptive schemes
15  but speaking the truth let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head christ
16  from him all the body is harmoniously joined together and made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed
when each respective member functions properly this contributes to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love
17  so this is what i say and bear witness to in the lord that you should no longer go on walking just as the nations also walk in the futility of their minds
18  they are in darkness mentally and alienated from the life that belongs to god because of the ignorance that is in them because of the insensitivity of their hearts
19  having gone past all moral sense they gave themselves over to brazen conduct to practice every sort of uncleanness with greediness
20  but you did not learn the christ to be like this
21  if indeed you heard him and were taught by means of him just as truth is in jesus
22  you were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your former course of conduct and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires
23  and you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude
24  and should put on the new personality that was created according to gods will in true righteousness and loyalty
25  therefore now that you have put away deceit each one of you speak truth with his neighbor because we are members belonging to one another
26  be wrathful but do not sin do not let the sun set while you are still angry
27  do not give the devil an opportunity
28  let the one who steals steal no more rather let him do hard work doing good work with his hands so that he may have something to share with someone in need
29  let a rotten word not come out of your mouth but only what is good for building up as the need may be to impart what is beneficial to the hearers
30  also do not be grieving gods holy spirit with which you have been sealed for a day of releasing by ransom
31  put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness anger wrath screaming and abusive speech as well as everything injurious
32  but become kind to one another tenderly compassionate freely forgiving one another just as god also by christ freely forgave you
6  children be obedient to your parents in union with the lord for this is righteous
2  honor your father and your mother is the first command with a promise
3  that it may go well with you and you may remain a long time on the earth
4  and fathers do not be irritating your children but go on bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of jehovah
5  slaves be obedient to your human masters with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your hearts as to the christ
6  not only when being watched just to please men but as christs slaves doing the will of god wholesouled
7  slave with a good attitude as to jehovah and not to men
8  for you know that whatever good each one does he will receive this back from jehovah whether he is a slave or a freeman
9  also you masters keep treating them in the same way not threatening for you know that both their master and yours is in the heavens and there is no partiality with him
10  finally go on acquiring power in the lord and in the mightiness of his strength
11  put on the complete suit of armor from god so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the devil
12  because we have a struggle not against blood and flesh but against the governments against the authorities against the world rulers of this darkness against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places
13  for this reason take up the complete suit of armor from god so that you may be able to resist in the wicked day and after you have accomplished everything to stand firm
14  stand firm therefore with the belt of truth fastened around your waist wearing the breastplate of righteousness
15  and having your feet shod in readiness to declare the good news of peace
16  besides all of this take up the large shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked ones burning arrows
17  also accept the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit that is gods word
18  while with every form of prayer and supplication you carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit
and to that end stay awake constantly making supplication in behalf of all the holy ones
19  pray also for me that the words may be given to me when i open my mouth so that i may be able to speak boldly in making known the sacred secret of the good news
20  for which i am acting as an ambassador in chains and that i may speak about it with boldness as i ought to speak
21  now so that you may also know about me and how i am doing tych πicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord will make everything known to you
22  i am sending him to you for this very purpose so that you may know how we are and that he may comfort your hearts
23  may the brothers have peace and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ
24  may the undeserved kindness be with all those loving our lord jesus christ in incorruptness
5  therefore become imitators of god as beloved children
2  and go on walking in love just as the christ also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice a sweet fragrance to god
3  let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness or greediness not even be mentioned among you just as is proper for holy people
4  neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jestingthings that are not befittingbut rather the giving of thanks
5  for you know this recognizing it for yourselves that no sexually immoral person or unclean person or greedy person which means being an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of the christ and of god
6  let no man deceive you with empty words for because of such things the wrath of god is coming upon the sons of disobedience
7  therefore do not be sharers with them
8  for you were once darkness but you are now light in connection with the lord
go on walking as children of light
9  for the fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth
10  keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the lord
11  and stop sharing in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness rather expose them for what they are
12  for the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention
13  now all the things that are being exposed are made evident by the light for everything that is being made evident is light
14  therefore it is said awake o sleeper and arise from the dead and the christ will shine upon you
15  so keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons
16  making the best use of your time because the days are wicked
17  on this account stop being unreasonable but keep perceiving what the will of jehovah is
18  also do not get drunk with wine in which there is debauchery but keep getting filled with spirit
19  speak to one another with psalms praises to god and spiritual songs singing and accompanying yourselves with music in your hearts to jehovah
20  always giving thanks to our god and father for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ
21  be in subjection to one another in fear of christ
22  let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the lord
23  because a husband is head of his wife just as the christ is head of the congregation he being a savior of this body
24  in fact as the congregation is in subjection to the christ wives should also be to their husbands in everything
25  husbands continue loving your wives just as the christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it
26  in order that he might sanctify it cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word
27  so that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor without a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things but holy and without blemish
28  in the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies
a man who loves his wife loves himself
29  for no man ever hated his own body but he feeds and cherishes it just as the christ does the congregation
30  because we are members of his body
31  for this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife and the two will be one flesh
32  this sacred secret is great
now i am speaking about christ and the congregation
33  nevertheless each one of you must love his wife as he does himself on the other hand the wife should have deep respect for her husband
1  paul an apostle of christ jesus through gods will to the holy ones who are in eph πesus and are faithful in union with christ jesus
2  may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
3  praised be the god and father of our lord jesus christ for he has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in union with christ
4  as he chose us to be in union with him before the founding of the world that we should be holy and unblemished before him in love
5  for he foreordained us to be adopted as his own sons through jesus christ according to his good pleasure and will
6  in praise of his glorious undeserved kindness that he kindly bestowed on us by means of his beloved one
7  by means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one yes the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his undeserved kindness
8  this undeserved kindness he caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding
9  by making known to us the sacred secret of his will
it is according to his good pleasure that he himself purposed
10  for an administration at the full limit of the appointed times to gather all things together in the christ the things in the heavens and the things on the earth
yes in him
11  with whom we are in union and were assigned as heirs having been foreordained according to the purpose of the one who accomplishes all things as he decides according to his will
12  so that we who have been first to hope in the christ should serve for the praise of his glory
13  but you also hoped in him after you heard the word of truth the good news about your salvation
after you believed you were sealed by means of him with the promised holy spirit
14  which is a token in advance of our inheritance for the purpose of releasing gods own possession by a ransom to his glorious praise
15  that is why i also since i have heard of the faith that you have in the lord jesus and the love that you demonstrate toward all the holy ones
16  never stop giving thanks for you
i continue mentioning you in my prayers
17  that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the accurate knowledge of him
18  he has enlightened the eyes of your heart so that you may know to what hope he called you what glorious riches he holds as an inheritance for the holy ones
19  and how surpassing the greatness of his power is toward us believers
it is according to the operation of the mightiness of his strength
20  which he exercised toward christ when he raised him up from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places
21  far above every government and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this system of things but also in that to come
22  he also subjected all things under his feet and made him head over all things with regard to the congregation
23  which is his body the fullness of him who fills up all things in all
2  furthermore god made you alive though you were dead in your trespasses and sins
2  in which you at one time walked according to the system of things of this world according to the ruler of the authority of the air the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience
3  yes among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh carrying out the will of the flesh and of our thoughts and we were naturally children of wrath just as the rest
4  but god being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us
5  made us alive together with the christ even when we were dead in trespassesby undeserved kindness you have been saved
6  moreover he raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly places in union with christ jesus
7  so that in the coming systems of things he might demonstrate the surpassing riches of his undeserved kindness in his graciousness toward us in union with christ jesus
8  by this undeserved kindness you have been saved through faith and this is not of your own doing rather it is gods gift
9  no it is not a result of works so that no one should have grounds for boasting
10  we are gods handiwork and were created in union with christ jesus for good works which god determined in advance for us to walk in them
11  therefore remember that at one time you people of the nations by fleshly descent were the ones called uncircumcision by those called circumcision which is made in the flesh by human hands
12  at that time you were without christ alienated from the state of israel strangers to the covenants of the promise you had no hope and were without god in the world
13  but now in union with christ jesus you who were once far off have come to be near by the blood of the christ
14  for he is our peace the one who made the two groups one and destroyed the wall in between that fenced them off
15  by means of his flesh he abolished the enmity the law of commandments consisting in decrees in order to make the two groups in union with himself into one new man and to make peace
16  and to reconcile fully both peoples in one body to god through the torture stake because he had killed off the enmity by means of himself
17  and he came and declared the good news of peace to you who were far off and peace to those near
18  because through him we both peoples have free access to the father by one spirit
19  so you are no longer strangers and foreigners but you are fellow citizens of the holy ones and are members of the household of god
20  and you have been built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets while christ jesus himself is the foundation cornerstone
21  in union with him the whole building being harmoniously joined together is growing into a holy temple for jehovah
22  in union with him you too are being built up together into a place for god to inhabit by spirit
3  for this reason i paul the prisoner of christ jesus in behalf of you the people of the nations
2  if really you have heard about the stewardship of gods undeserved kindness that was given to me for your sakes
3  that by way of a revelation the sacred secret was made known to me just as i wrote previously in brief
4  so when you read this you can realize my comprehension of the sacred secret of the christ
5  in other generations this secret was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by spirit
6  namely that people of the nations should in union with christ jesus and through the good news be joint heirs and fellow members of the body and partakers with us of the promise
7  i became a minister of this according to the free gift of gods undeserved kindness that was given me through the operation of his power
8  to me a man less than the least of all holy ones this undeserved kindness was given so that i should declare to the nations the good news about the unfathomable riches of the christ
9  and should make everyone see the administration of the sacred secret that has been hidden through the ages in god who created all things
10  this was so that now through the congregation there might be made known to the governments and the authorities in the heavenly places the greatly diversified wisdom of god
11  this is according to the eternal purpose that he formed in connection with the christ jesus our lord
12  by means of whom we have this freeness of speech and free access with confidence through our faith in him
13  so i ask you not to give up on account of my tribulations in your behalf for these mean glory for you
14  for this reason i bend my knees to the father
15  to whom every family in heaven and on earth owes its name
16  i pray that he may grant you through the abundance of his glory to be made mighty in the man you are inside with power through his spirit
17  and that through your faith you may have the christ dwell in your hearts with love
may you be rooted and established on the foundation
18  in order that with all the holy ones you may be thoroughly able to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height and depth
19  and to know the love of the christ which surpasses knowledge so that you may be filled with all the fullness that god gives
20  now to the one who can according to his power that is operating in us do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive
21  to him be the glory by means of the congregation and by means of christ jesus to all generations forever and ever
amen
