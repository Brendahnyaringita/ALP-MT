6  from the window of my housethrough my lattice i looked down
7  and as i observed the naive onesi discerned among the youths a young man lacking good sense
8  he passed along the street near her cornerand he marched in the direction of her house
9  in the twilight in the eveningat the approach of night and darkness
10  then i saw a woman meet himdressed like a prostitute with a cunning heart
11  she is loud and defiant
she never stays at home
12  one moment she is outside next she is in the public squaresshe lurks near every corner
13  she grabs hold of him and gives him a kisswith a bold face she says to him
14  i had to offer communion sacrifices
today i paid my vows
15  that is why i came out to meet youto look for you and i found you
16  i have spread fine covers upon my bedcolorful linen from egypt
17  i have sprinkled my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon
18  come let us drink our fill of love until the morninglet us enjoy passionate love together
19  for my husband is not at homehe has gone on a distant journey
20  he took a bag of money with himand he will not return until the day of the full moon
21  she misleads him with great persuasiveness
she seduces him with smooth speech
22  suddenly he goes after her like a bull to the slaughterlike a fool to be punished in the stocks
23  until an arrow pierces his liverlike a bird rushing into a trap he does not know that it will cost him his life
24  and now my sons listen to mepay attention to the words i speak
25  do not let your heart turn aside to her ways
do not stray onto her paths
26  for she has caused many to fall down slainand those she has killed are numerous
27  her house leads to the graveit goes down to the inner chambers of death
23  when you sit down to eat with a kingcarefully consider what is before you
2  put a knife to your throatif you have a large appetite
3  do not crave his delicaciesfor it is deceptive food
4  do not wear yourself out to gain wealth
stop and show understanding
5  when you cast your eyes on it it is not therefor it will surely sprout wings like an eagle and fly off into the sky
6  do not eat the food of a stingy persondo not crave his delicacies
7  for he is like one keeping accounts
eat and drink he says to you but he does not mean it
8  you will vomit up the morsels you have eatenand will have wasted your compliments
9  do not speak in the ears of the stupid onefor he will despise the wisdom of your words
10  do not move an ancient boundary markeror encroach on the field of the fatherless
11  for their defender is stronghe will take up their cause against you
12  apply your heart to disciplineand your ear to the sayings of knowledge
13  do not hold back discipline from a boy
if you strike him with the rod he will not die
14  with the rod you should strike himin order to save him from the grave
15  my son if your heart becomes wisethen my own heart will rejoice
16  my innermost being will find joywhen your lips speak what is right
17  let your heart not envy sinnersbut be in the fear of jehovah all day long
18  for then you will have a futureand your hope will not be cut off
19  listen my son and become wiseand direct your heart in the right way
20  do not be among those who drink too much wineamong those who gorge themselves on meat

24  the father of a righteous one will surely be joyfulwhoever fathers a wise son will rejoice in him
25  your father and your mother will rejoiceand she who gave birth to you will be joyful
26  my son do give your heart to meand may your eyes take pleasure in my ways
27  for a prostitute is a deep pitand an immoral woman is a narrow well
28  she lies in wait like a robbershe increases the number of unfaithful men
29  who has woe who has uneasiness who has quarrels who has complaints who has wounds for no reason who has bleary eyes
30  those lingering long over winethose searching out mixed wine
31  do not look at the wines red coloras it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly
32  for in the end it bites like a serpentand it secretes poison like a viper
33  your eyes will see strange thingsand your heart will speak perverse things
34  and you will be like one lying down in the middle of the sealike one lying at the top of a ships mast
35  you will say they have struck me but i did not feel it
they beat me but i did not know it
when will i wake up i need another drink
22  a good name is to be chosen rather than great wealthto be respected is better than silver and gold
2  the rich and the poor have this in common jehovah made them both
3  the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himselfbut the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences
4  the result of humility and the fear of jehovahis riches and glory and life
5  thorns and traps are in the crooked mans pathbut whoever values his life keeps far away from them
6  train a boy in the way he should goeven when he grows old he will not depart from it
7  the rich one rules the poorand the borrower is a slave to the lender
8  whoever sows unrighteousness will reap disasterand the rod of his fury will come to its end
9  the generous person will be blessedfor he shares his food with the poor
10  drive away the scornful manand contention will disappeardisputes and insults will cease
11  the one who loves a pure heart and whose speech is graciouswill have the king as his friend
12  the eyes of jehovah safeguard knowledgebut he overturns the words of the treacherous
13  the lazy one says there is a lion outside i will be killed in the middle of the public square
14  the mouth of wayward women is a deep pit
the one condemned by jehovah will fall into it
15  foolishness is bound up in the heart of a boybut the rod of discipline will remove it far from him
16  the one defrauding the poor to increase his wealthand the one giving gifts to the richwill end up in poverty
17  incline your ear and listen to the words of the wisein order to apply your heart to my knowledge
18  for it is pleasant to keep them deep within youso that all of them may constantly be on your lips
19  for your confidence to be in jehovahi am giving you knowledge today
20  have i not already written youimparting advice and knowledge
21  to teach you true and reliable wordsso that you can return with an accurate report to the one who sent you
22  do not rob the poor man because he is poorand do not crush the lowly man in the city gate
23  for jehovah himself will plead their causeand he will take the life of those who defraud them
24  do not keep company with a hottempered manor get involved with one disposed to rage
25  so that you never learn his waysand ensnare yourself
26  do not be among those who shake hands in a pledgewho put up security for loans
27  if you have nothing to payyour bed will be taken right out from under you
28  do not move an ancient boundary markerthat your forefathers put in place
29  have you seen a man skillful at his work he will stand before kingshe will not stand before common men
6  my son if you have put up security for your neighborif you have given your handshake to a stranger
2  if you have been ensnared by your promisecaught by the words of your mouth
3  do this my son and free yourselffor you have fallen into the hand of your neighbor go and humble yourself and urgently plead with your neighbor
4  do not allow your eyes to sleepnor your eyelids to slumber
5  free yourself like a gazelle from the hunters handlike a bird from the hand of the birdcatcher
6  go to the ant you lazy oneobserve its ways and become wise
7  although it has no commander officer or ruler
8  it prepares its food in the summerand it gathers its food supplies in the harvest
9  how long you lazy one will you lie there when will you rise up from your sleep
10  a little sleep a little slumberinga little folding of the hands to rest
11  and your poverty will come like a banditand your want like an armed man
12  a useless and wicked man walks about with crooked speech
13  he winks with his eye signals with his foot and motions with his fingers
14  with a perverted hearthe is always scheming evil and spreading contentions
15  therefore his disaster will come suddenlyin a moment he will be broken beyond healing
16  there are six things that jehovah hatesyes seven things that he detests
17  haughty eyes a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood
18  a heart plotting wicked schemes and feet that run quickly to evil
19  a false witness who lies with every breathand anyone sowing contentions among brothers
20  observe my son the commandment of your fatherand do not forsake the instruction of your mother
21  always bind them around your hearttie them about your neck
22  when you walk about it will lead youwhen you lie down it will stand guard over youand when you awaken it will speak to you
23  for the commandment is a lampand the law is a lightand the reproofs of discipline are the way to life
24  they will guard you against the bad womanagainst the seductive tongue of the immoral woman
25  do not desire her beauty in your heartor allow her to captivate you with her alluring eyes
26  for because of a prostitute a man is reduced to a loaf of breadbut the wife of another man preys on a precious life
27  can a man rake fire to his chest and not burn his garments
28  or can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet
29  it is the same with anyone having relations with his neighbors wifeno one who touches her will go unpunished
30  people do not despise a thiefif he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry
31  yet when found he will repay sevenfoldhe will give up all the valuables of his house
32  anyone committing adultery with a woman is lacking good sensethe one who does so brings ruin on himself
33  he will get only wounds and dishonorand his disgrace will not be wiped away
34  for jealousy makes a husband furioushe will show no compassion when he takes revenge
35  he will accept no compensationhe will not be appeased no matter how large you make the gift
31  the words of king lem πuel the weighty message his mother gave to instruct him
2  what should i tell you o my sonwhat o son of my womband what o son of my vows
3  do not give your vigor to womennor follow ways that destroy kings
4  it is not for kings o lem πuelit is not for kings to drink winenor for rulers to say where is my drink
5  so that they do not drink and forget what is decreedand pervert the rights of the lowly ones
6  give alcohol to those who are perishingand wine to those in bitter distress
7  let them drink and forget their povertylet them remember their trouble no more
8  speak up in behalf of the speechlessdefend the rights of all who are perishing
9  speak up and judge righteouslydefend the rights of the lowly and the poor
10  who can find a capable wife her value is far more than that of corals
11  her husband trusts her from his heartand he lacks nothing of value
12  she rewards him with good not badall the days of her life
13  she obtains wool and linenshe delights to work with her hands
14  she is like the ships of a merchantbringing her food in from afar
15  she also rises while it is still nightproviding food for her householdand portions for her female servants

17  she prepares herself for hard workand she strengthens her arms
18  she sees that her trading is profitableher lamp does not go out at night
19  her hands seize the distaffand her hands take hold of the spindle
20  she extends her palm to the lowly oneand she opens her hands to the poor
21  she does not worry about her household because of the snowfor her whole household is clothed in warm garments
22  she makes her own bed covers
her clothing is of linen and purple wool
23  her husband is wellknown in the city gateswhere he sits among the elders of the land
24  she makes and sells linen garmentsand supplies belts to the merchants
25  she is clothed with strength and splendorand she looks to the future with confidence
26  she opens her mouth in wisdomthe law of kindness is on her tongue
27  she watches over the activity of her householdand the bread of laziness she does not eat
28  her children rise up and declare her happyher husband rises up and praises her
29  there are many capable womenbut youyou surpass them all
30  charm may be false and beauty may be fleetingbut the woman who fears jehovah will be praised
31  give her the reward for what she doesand let her works praise her in the city gates
21  a kings heart is like streams of water in jehovahs hand
he directs it wherever he pleases
2  all of a mans ways seem right to himbut jehovah examines the hearts
3  to do what is right and justis more pleasing to jehovah than a sacrifice
4  haughty eyes and an arrogant heartthe lamp that guides the wicked is sin
5  the plans of the diligent surely lead to successbut all who are hasty surely head for poverty
6  gaining treasures by a lying tongueis like a vanishing mist a deadly snare
7  the violence of the wicked will sweep them awayfor they refuse to act with justice
8  the way of a guilty man is crookedbut the activity of the pure man is upright
9  better to dwell on a corner of the roofthan in the same house with a quarrelsome wife

11  when a ridiculer is punished the inexperienced become wiserand when a wise person receives insight he gains knowledge

16  the man who strays from the way of insightwill rest in the company of those powerless in death
17  the one who loves having a good time will come to povertythe one who loves wine and oil will not grow rich
18  the wicked one is a ransom for the righteous oneand the treacherous one will be taken in place of the upright
19  better to dwell in the wildernessthan with a quarrelsome and irritable wife
20  precious treasure and oil are found in the house of the wisebut the stupid man will squander what he has
21  whoever pursues righteousness and loyal lovewill find life righteousness and glory
22  a wise man can scale the city of the mightyand undermine the strength in which they trust
23  the one guarding his mouth and his tonguekeeps himself out of trouble
24  a presumptuous arrogant braggart is what you callthe man who acts with reckless presumptuousness
25  what the lazy man craves will put him to deathfor his hands refuse to work
26  all day long he greedily cravesbut the righteous one gives holding nothing back
27  the sacrifice of the wicked is detestable
how much more when he offers it with evil intent
28  a lying witness will perishbut the man who listens will testify with success
29  the wicked man puts on a bold facebut it is the upright one whose course is sure
30  there is no wisdom nor discernment nor counsel in opposition to jehovah
31  the horse is prepared for the day of battlebut salvation belongs to jehovah

5  remove the wicked one from the kings presenceand his throne will be firmly established in righteousness

8  do not rush into a legal disputefor what will you do later if your neighbor humiliates you
9  plead your case with your neighborbut do not reveal what you were told confidentially
10  so that the one listening will not put you to shameand you spread a bad report that cannot be recalled
11  like apples of gold in silver carvingsis a word spoken at the right time
12  like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine goldis a wise reprover to the receptive ear
13  just like the coldness of snow on the day of harvestis a faithful messenger to those who sent himfor he refreshes his master
14  like clouds and wind that bring no rainis a man who boasts about a gift never given
15  by patience a commander is won overand a gentle tongue can break a bone

19  like a broken tooth or an unsteady footis confidence in an unreliable person in times of trouble
20  like one who removes a garment on a cold dayand like vinegar poured on sodais the one who sings songs to a gloomy heart

22  for you will be heaping burning coals on his headand jehovah will reward you
23  the north wind brings a downpourand a gossiping tongue brings an angry face

24  whoever says to the wicked one you are righteous will be cursed by the peoples and denounced by the nations
25  but it will go well for those reproving himblessings of good things will come upon them
26  people will kiss the lips of the one replying honestly
27  prepare your outside work and get everything ready in the fieldthen build your house
28  do not testify against your neighbor without grounds

30  i passed by the field of the lazy oneby the vineyard of the man lacking good sense
31  i saw that it was overgrown with weedsthe ground was covered with nettlesand its stone wall was broken down
32  i observed this and took it to hearti saw it and learned this lesson
33  a little sleep a little slumberinga little folding of the hands to rest
34  and your poverty will come like a banditand your want like an armed man
5  my son pay attention to my wisdom
listen carefully to my discernment
2  so that you may guard your thinking abilitiesand safeguard knowledge with your lips

4  but in the end she is as bitter as wormwoodand as sharp as a twoedged sword
5  her feet descend into death
her steps lead straight to the grave
6  she gives no thought to the path of life
her course wanders but she does not know where
7  now my sons listen to meand do not turn away from what i am saying
8  stay far away from herdo not go near the entrance of her house
9  so that you may not give your dignity to othersnor reap years of what is cruel
10  so that strangers may not drain your resourcesand what you labored for go to the house of a foreigner
11  otherwise you will groan at the end of your lifewhen your flesh and body waste away
12  and you say how i hated discipline how my heart despised reproof
13  i did not listen to the voice of my instructorsor pay attention to my teachers
14  i have come to the brink of complete ruinin the midst of the entire congregation

5  the thoughts of a mans heart are like deep watersbut the discerning man draws them out
6  many men proclaim their loyal lovebut who can find a faithful man

8  listen my son to the discipline of your fatherand do not forsake the instruction of your mother
9  they are an attractive wreath for your headand a fine ornament for your neck
10  my son if sinners try to entice you do not consent
11  if they say come with us
let us set an ambush to shed blood
we will lie hidden waiting for innocent victims without cause
12  we will swallow them alive as the grave doeswhole like those going down to the pit
13  let us seize all their precious treasureswe will fill our houses with spoil
14  you should join usand we will all share equally what we steal
15  my son do not follow them
keep your feet off their path
16  for their feet run to do evilthey hurry to shed blood
17  it is surely in vain to spread a net in full sight of a bird
18  that is why these lie in ambush to shed bloodthey lie hidden to take the lives of others
19  these are the ways of those seeking dishonest profitwhich will take away the life of those who obtain it
20  true wisdom cries aloud in the street
it keeps raising its voice in the public squares
21  at the corner of the busy streets it calls out
at the entrances of the city gates it says
22  how long will you inexperienced ones love inexperience how long will you ridiculers take pleasure in ridicule and how long will you foolish ones hate knowledge
23  respond to my reproof
then i will pour out my spirit for youi will make my words known to you
24  because i called out but you kept refusingi stretched out my hand but no one was paying attention
25  you kept neglecting all my adviceand rejecting my reproof
26  i also will laugh when disaster strikes youi will mock when what you dread comes
27  when what you dread comes like a stormand your disaster arrives like a storm windwhen distress and trouble come upon you
28  at that time they will keep calling me but i will not answerthey will eagerly look for me but they will not find me
29  because they hated knowledgeand they did not choose to fear jehovah
30  they refused my advicethey disrespected all my reproof
31  so they will bear the consequences of their wayand they will be glutted with their own counsel
32  for the waywardness of the inexperienced will kill themand the complacency of fools will destroy them
33  but the one listening to me will dwell in securityand be undisturbed by the dread of calamity

33  the curse of jehovah is on the house of the wicked onebut he blesses the home of the righteous
34  for he mocks those who ridiculebut he shows favor to the meek
35  the wise will inherit honorbut the stupid ones glorify dishonor
12  the one who loves discipline loves knowledgebut the one who hates reproof is unreasoning
2  the good person obtains jehovahs approvalbut he condemns the man of wicked schemes
3  no man is made secure by wickednessbut the righteous will never be uprooted
4  a capable wife is a crown to her husbandbut the wife who acts shamefully is like rottenness in his bones
5  the thoughts of the righteous are justbut the guidance of the wicked is deceptive
6  the words of the wicked are a deadly ambushbut the mouth of the upright saves them
7  when the wicked are overthrown they are no morebut the house of the righteous will keep standing
8  a man is praised for the discretion of his mouthbut one with a twisted heart will be treated with contempt
9  better to be lightly esteemed and have a servantthan to glorify oneself and have no food

20  deceit is in the heart of those who plot mischiefbut those who promote peace have joy
21  no harm will befall the righteous onebut the wicked will have their fill of calamity
22  lying lips are detestable to jehovahbut those acting faithfully bring pleasure to him
23  a shrewd man conceals what he knowsbut the heart of the fool blurts out his foolishness
24  the hand of the diligent ones will rulebut idle hands will be put to forced labor
25  anxiety in a mans heart weighs it downbut a good word cheers it up
26  the righteous one searches out his pasturesbut the course of the wicked leads them astray
27  the lazy do not chase after the preybut diligence is a mans precious treasure
28  the path of righteousness leads to lifealong its pathway there is no death
