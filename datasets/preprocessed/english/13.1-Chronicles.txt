10  now the philisʹtines were fighting against israel
and the men of israel fled from before the philisʹtines and many fell slain on mount gilboʹa
2  the philisʹtines kept in close range of saul and his sons and the philisʹtines struck down jonʹathan abinʹadab and malʹchishuʹa sauls sons
3  the fighting grew fierce against saul and the archers found him and he was wounded by the archers
4  then saul said to his armorbearer draw your sword and run me through with it so that these uncircumcised men may not come and deal ruthlessly with me
but his armorbearer was unwilling because he was very much afraid
so saul took the sword and fell on it
5  when his armorbearer saw that saul was dead he too fell on his own sword and died
6  thus saul and his three sons died and all those of his house died together
7  when all the people of israel in the valley saw that everyone had fled and that saul and his sons had died they began to abandon their cities and flee the philisʹtines then came and occupied them
8  the next day when the philisʹtines came to strip the slain they found saul and his sons fallen on mount gilboʹa
9  so they stripped him and took off his head and his armor and they sent word throughout the land of the philisʹtines to spread the news to their idols and the people
10  then they put his armor in the house of their god and fastened his skull to the house of daʹgon
11  when all those of jaʹbesh in gilʹead heard about all that the philisʹtines had done to saul
12  all the warriors rose up and carried off the corpse of saul and the corpses of his sons
they brought them to jaʹbesh and buried their bones under the big tree in jaʹbesh and they fasted for seven days
13  thus saul died for the unfaithfulness he had shown against jehovah because he had not obeyed the word of jehovah also for consulting a spirit medium
14  instead of inquiring of jehovah
so he put him to death and turned the kingship over to david the son of jesʹse

38  these mentioned by name were the chieftains among their families and the household of their forefathers increased in number
39  and they went to the entrance of geʹdor to the east side of the valley to look for pastures for their flocks
40  they eventually found rich and good pastures and the land was spacious quiet and undisturbed
those who previously lived there were hamʹites
41  these whose names are listed came during the days of king hezekiʹah of judah and struck down the tents of the hamʹites and the meuʹnim who were there
they devoted them to destruction down to this day and they settled in their place because there were pastures for their flocks there
42  some of the simʹeonites 500 men went to mount seʹir with pelatiʹah neariʹah rephaʹiah and uzʹziel the sons of ishʹi who led them
43  and they struck down the rest of the amalʹekites who had escaped and they have lived there down to this day
26  the divisions of gatekeepers were as follows of the korʹahites meshelemiʹah the son of koʹre of the sons of aʹsaph
2  and meshelemiʹah had sons zechariʹah the firstborn jediʹael the second zebadiʹah the third jathʹniel the fourth

5  amʹmiel the sixth isʹsachar the seventh and peulʹlethai the eighth for god had blessed him
6  and to his son shemaiʹah there were sons born who were rulers of their paternal house for they were mighty capable men
7  the sons of shemaiʹah othʹni rephʹael oʹbed and elzaʹbad and his brothers eliʹhu and semachiʹah were also capable men
8  all of these were of the sons of oʹbedeʹdom they and their sons and their brothers were capable men and qualified for the service 62 belonging to oʹbedeʹdom
9  and meshelemiʹah had sons and brothers 18 capable men
10  and hoʹsah of the sons of merarʹi had sons
shimʹri was the head for although he was not the firstborn his father appointed him as head
11  hilkiʹah the second tebaliʹah the third zechariʹah the fourth
all the sons and brothers of hoʹsah were 13
12  of these divisions of the gatekeepers the headmen had duties just as their brothers did to minister at the house of jehovah
13  so they cast lots the small and the great alike by their paternal houses for the different gates
14  then the lot to the east fell to shelemiʹah
for zechariʹah his son a discreet adviser they cast the lots and his lot came out to the north
15  oʹbedeʹdom had his to the south and his sons were assigned the storehouses
16  shupʹpim and hoʹsah had theirs to the west near the shalʹlecheth gate by the highway that goes up guard group corresponding to guard group
17  there were six levites to the east to the north four each day and to the south four each day and for the storehouses two by two
18  for the portico to the west there were four at the highway and two at the portico
19  these were the divisions of the gatekeepers from the sons of the korʹahites and of the merarʹites
20  as regards the levites ahiʹjah was in charge of the treasuries of the house of the true god and the treasuries of the things made holy
21  the sons of laʹdan the sons of the gerʹshonite belonging to laʹdan the heads of the paternal houses belonging to laʹdan the gerʹshonite jehiʹeli
22  and the sons of jehiʹeli zeʹtham and his brother joel
they were in charge of the treasuries of the house of jehovah
23  from the amʹramites the izʹharites the hebʹronites and the uzziʹelites
24  shebʹuel son of gerʹshom son of moses was a leader in charge of the storehouses
25  as regards his brothers of elieʹzer there was rehabiʹah his son jeshaʹiah his son joʹram his son zichʹri his son and sheloʹmoth his son
26  this sheloʹmoth and his brothers were in charge of all the treasuries of the things made holy which king david the heads of the paternal houses the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and the chiefs of the army had made holy
27  from the wars and from the spoil they had made things holy to maintain the house of jehovah
28  also all that samuel the seer saul the son of kish abʹner the son of ner and joʹab the son of zeruʹiah had made holy
whatever anyone made holy was put in the care of sheloʹmith and his brothers
29  of the izʹharites chenaniʹah and his sons were assigned outside administrative duties as officers and as judges over israel
30  of the hebʹronites hashabiʹah and his brothers 1700 capable men were over the administration of israel in the region west of the jordan for all the work of jehovah and for the kings service
31  of the hebʹronites jeriʹjah was the head of the hebʹronites by line of descent of their paternal house
in the 40th year of davids kingship they were sought out and mighty capable men were found among them in jaʹzer in gilʹead
32  and his brothers numbered 2700 capable men heads of the paternal houses
so king david assigned them over the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of the manasʹsites for every matter of the true god and matter of the king
11  in time all the israelites gathered to david at hebʹron and said look we are your own bone and flesh
2  in times past while saul was king you were the one who was leading israel on its campaigns
and jehovah your god said to you you will shepherd my people israel and you will become leader over my people israel
3  so all the elders of israel came to the king at hebʹron and david made a covenant with them in hebʹron before jehovah
then they anointed david as king over israel according to jehovahs word through samuel
4  later david and all israel set out for jerusalem that is jeʹbus where the jebʹusites were inhabiting the land
5  the inhabitants of jeʹbus taunted david you will never come in here however david captured the stronghold of zion which is now the city of david
6  so david said whoever is the first to strike the jebʹusites will become chief and prince
and joʹab the son of zeruʹiah went up first and he became the chief
7  then david took up residence in the stronghold
that is why they called it the city of david
8  he began to build up the city all around from the mound to the areas around it and joʹab restored the rest of the city
9  thus david became greater and greater and jehovah of armies was with him
10  now these are the heads of davids mighty warriors who gave him strong support in his kingship together with all israel to make him king according to jehovahs word concerning israel
11  this is the list of davids mighty warriors jashoʹbeam the son of a hachʹmonite the head of the three
he brandished his spear over 300 slain at one time
12  next to him was eleaʹzar the son of doʹdo the ahoʹhite
he was among the three mighty warriors
13  he was with david at pasdamʹmim where the philisʹtines had gathered together for war
now there was a plot of land full of barley and the people had fled because of the philisʹtines
14  but he took his stand in the middle of the field and defended it and kept striking down the philisʹtines so that jehovah brought about a great victory
15  three of the 30 headmen went down to the rock to david at the cave of adulʹlam while a philisʹtine army was camped in the valley of rephʹaim
16  david was then in the stronghold and a garrison of the philisʹtines was in bethʹlehem
17  then david expressed his longing if only i could have a drink of the water from the cistern by the gate of bethʹlehem
18  at that the three forced their way into the camp of the philisʹtines and drew water from the cistern by the gate of bethʹlehem and brought it to david but david refused to drink it and poured it out to jehovah
19  he said it is unthinkable on my part from the standpoint of my god to do this should i drink the blood of these men who risked their lives for it was at the risk of their lives that they brought it
so he refused to drink it
these are the things that his three mighty warriors did
20  abishʹai the brother of joʹab became head of another three he brandished his spear over 300 slain and he had a reputation like the three
21  of the other three he was more distinguished than two of them and he was their chief yet he did not attain to the rank of the first three

23  he also struck down an egyptian man of extraordinary sizefive cubits tall
though the egyptian had a spear in his hand like the beam of loom workers he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the egyptians hand and killed him with his own spear
24  these things benaiʹah the son of jehoiʹada did and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors

2  when david finished offering up the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices he blessed the people in the name of jehovah
3  further he distributed to all the israelites to each man and woman a round loaf of bread a date cake and a raisin cake

36  may jehovah the god of israel be praisedthroughout all eternity

38  oʹbedeʹdom and his brothers numbering 68 and oʹbedeʹdom the son of jeduʹthun and hoʹsah were gatekeepers

18  some time later david defeated the philisʹtines and subdued them and took gath and its dependent towns out of the hands of the philisʹtines

and davids sons were first in position next to the king
17  as soon as david was settled in his own house he said to nathan the prophet here i am living in a house of cedars while the ark of the covenant of jehovah is under tent cloths
2  nathan replied to david do whatever is in your heart for the true god is with you
3  on that very night the word of god came to nathan saying
4  go and say to my servant david this is what jehovah says you are not the one who will build the house for me to dwell in
5  for i have not dwelled in a house from the day i brought israel out to this day but i continued going from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another
6  during all the time that i went with all israel did i ever say one word to any of the judges of israel whom i appointed to shepherd my people saying why did you not build a house of cedars for me
7  now say this to my servant david this is what jehovah of armies says i took you from the pastures from following the flock to become a leader over my people israel
8  and i will be with you wherever you go and i will do away with all your enemies from before you and i will make a name for you like the name of the great men of the earth
9  i will appoint a place for my people israel and settle them and they will live there and not be disturbed anymore and wicked men will not oppress them again as they did in the past
10  from the day that i appointed judges over my people israel
and i will subdue all your enemies
moreover i tell you jehovah will build a house for you
11  when your days come to an end and you go to be with your forefathers i will raise up your offspring after you one of your sons and i will firmly establish his kingship
12  he is the one who will build a house for me and i will firmly establish his throne forever
13  i will become his father and he will become my son
i will not remove my loyal love from him the way i removed it from the one who was prior to you
14  i will cause him to stand in my house and in my kingship forever and his throne will last forever
15  nathan told david all these words and this entire vision
16  at that king david came in and sat down before jehovah and said who am i o jehovah god and what is my house that you have brought me this far
17  as if this were not enough o god you also speak about the house of your servant down to a distant future time and you have looked on me as if i were a man who should be further exalted o jehovah god
18  what more can your servant david say to you about the honor given me when you know your servant so well
19  o jehovah for the sake of your servant and in agreement with your heart you have done all these great things by revealing your greatness
20  o jehovah there is no one like you and there is no god except you everything we have heard with our ears confirms this
21  and what other nation on earth is like your people israel the true god went and redeemed them as his people
you made a name for yourself by your great and aweinspiring deeds driving out nations from before your people whom you redeemed from egypt
22  you made your people israel your own people for all time and you o jehovah became their god
23  now o jehovah may the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house prove faithful for all time and may you do just as you have promised
24  may your name endure and be exalted forever so that people may say jehovah of armies the god of israel is god to israel and may the house of your servant david be firmly established before you
25  for you my god have revealed to your servant your purpose to build him a house
that is why your servant has the confidence to offer this prayer to you
26  and now o jehovah you are the true god and you have promised these good things concerning your servant
27  so may it please you to bless the house of your servant and may it continue forever before you for you o jehovah have blessed and it is blessed forever

4  of these 24000 served as supervisors over the work of jehovahs house and there were 6000 officers and judges

24  these were the sons of leʹvi according to their paternal houses the heads of the paternal houses by those registered who were counted and listed by their names and who carried out the work for the service of the house of jehovah from 20 years old and up
25  for david had said jehovah the god of israel has given rest to his people and he will reside in jerusalem forever
26  also the levites will not have to carry the tabernacle or any of its utensils for its service
27  for according to the last instructions of david the levites from 20 years old and up were numbered
28  their function was to assist the sons of aaron for the service of the house of jehovah to be in charge of the courtyards the dining rooms the purification of every holy thing and any work needed for the service of the house of the true god
29  they assisted with the layer bread the fine flour for the grain offering the wafers of unleavened bread the griddle cakes the mixed dough and all measures of quantity and size
30  they were to stand morning by morning to thank and praise jehovah and likewise in the evening
31  they assisted whenever the burnt sacrifices were offered to jehovah on the sabbaths the new moons and during the festival seasons according to the number required by the rules concerning them doing so regularly before jehovah
32  they also took care of their responsibilities toward the tent of meeting toward the holy place and toward their brothers the sons of aaron for the service of the house of jehovah
22  david then said this is the house of jehovah the true god and this is an altar for burnt offering for israel
2  david then gave orders to bring together the foreign residents who were in the land of israel and he assigned them to be stonecutters to cut and shape stones for building the house of the true god
3  david also prepared iron in great quantity for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps and so much copper that it was beyond weighing
4  and also cedar timbers without number for the sidoʹnians and the tyrʹians brought great quantities of cedar timbers to david
5  and david said my son solʹomon is young and inexperienced and the house to be built for jehovah is to be exceedingly magnificent so that its fame and beauty will be known in all lands
therefore i will make preparation for him
so david prepared materials in great quantity before his death
6  moreover he summoned his son solʹomon and instructed him to build a house for jehovah the god of israel
7  david told his son solʹomon as for me it was my hearts desire to build a house for the name of jehovah my god
8  but jehovahs word came to me saying you have shed a great deal of blood and you have fought great wars
you will not build a house for my name for you have shed a great deal of blood on the earth before me
9  look you will have a son who will be a man of peace and i will give him rest from all his enemies who surround him for solʹomon will be his name and i will grant israel peace and quiet in his days
10  he is the one who will build a house for my name
he will become my son and i will be his father
i will firmly establish the throne of his kingship over israel forever
11  now my son may jehovah be with you and may you be successful and build the house of jehovah your god just as he has spoken concerning you
12  only may jehovah give you discretion and understanding when he gives you authority over israel so that you may keep the law of jehovah your god
13  then you will be successful if you carefully observe the regulations and the judgments that jehovah ordered moses to give israel
be courageous and strong
do not be afraid or be terrified
14  here i have taken great pains to prepare for jehovahs house 100000 talents of gold and 1000000 talents of silver and such great quantities of copper and iron that they cannot be weighed and i have prepared timbers and stones but you will add to them
15  a great number of workmen are with youstonecutters stonemasons woodworkers and all kinds of skilled workers
16  the gold silver copper and iron are beyond measure
get up and begin the work and may jehovah be with you
17  david then ordered all the princes of israel to help his son solʹomon
18  is not jehovah your god with you and has he not given you rest on every side for he handed over to me the inhabitants of the land and the land has been subdued before jehovah and before his people
19  now determine with all your heart and soul to seek jehovah your god and start building the sanctuary of jehovah the true god in order to bring the ark of the covenant of jehovah and the holy utensils of the true god to the house built for the name of jehovah

54  these were their settlements by their encampments in their territory for the descendants of aaron belonging to the family of the koʹhathites as the first lot fell to them
55  they gave them hebʹron in the land of judah with its surrounding pastures
56  but the field of the city and its settlements they gave to caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh
57  and to the descendants of aaron they gave the cities of refuge hebʹron also libʹnah with its pastures jatʹtir eshtemoʹa with its pastures

63  to the merarʹites by their families they assigned by lot 12 cities from the tribe of reuʹben the tribe of gad and the tribe of zebʹulun
64  thus the israelites gave the levites these cities with their pastures
65  furthermore they assigned by lot these cities from the tribe of judah the tribe of simʹeon and the tribe of benjamin which are mentioned by their names
66  some of the koʹhathite families had cities from the tribe of eʹphraim as their territory

80  and from the tribe of gad raʹmoth in gilʹead with its pastures mahanaʹim with its pastures
81  heshʹbon with its pastures and jaʹzer with its pastures
21  then satan stood up against israel and incited david to number israel
2  so david said to joʹab and the chiefs of the people go count israel from beʹersheʹba to dan then report to me so that i may know their number
3  but joʹab said may jehovah multiply his people 100 times my lord the king are not all of them already servants of my lord why does my lord want to do this why should he become a cause of guilt to israel
4  but the kings word prevailed over joʹab
so joʹab went out and traveled throughout israel after which he came to jerusalem
5  joʹab now gave to david the number of the people who were registered
all israel amounted to 1100000 men armed with swords and judah 470000 men armed with swords
6  but leʹvi and benjamin were not registered among them because the kings word was detestable to joʹab
7  now this was very displeasing to the true god so he struck israel
8  david then said to the true god i have sinned greatly by doing this
and now please forgive your servants error for i have acted very foolishly
9  jehovah then spoke to gad davids visionary saying
10  go and say to david this is what jehovah says i am giving you three options
choose the one that i should bring on you
11  so gad came in to david and said to him this is what jehovah says take your pick
12  whether there should be three years of famine or three months of being swept away by your adversaries while the sword of your enemies overtakes you or three days of the sword of jehovahpestilence in the landwith jehovahs angel bringing destruction in all the territory of israel
now consider what i should reply to the one who sent me
13  so david said to gad it is very distressing to me
please let me fall into the hand of jehovah for his mercy is very great but do not let me fall into the hand of man
14  then jehovah sent a pestilence on israel so that 70000 people out of israel fell
15  moreover the true god sent an angel to jerusalem to destroy it but as he was about to do so jehovah saw it and felt regret over the calamity and he said to the angel bringing destruction it is enough now let your hand drop
jehovahs angel was standing close to the threshing floor of orʹnan the jebʹusite
16  when david raised his eyes he saw jehovahs angel standing between the earth and the heavens with a drawn sword in his hand extended toward jerusalem
david and the elders covered with sackcloth at once threw themselves down with their faces to the ground
17  david said to the true god was it not i who said to number the people i am the one who sinned and i am the one who did wrong but these sheepwhat have they done o jehovah my god let your hand please come against me and my fathers house but do not bring this scourge on your people
18  jehovahs angel then told gad to tell david to go up and erect an altar to jehovah on the threshing floor of orʹnan the jebʹusite
19  so david went up at the word of gad which he had spoken in the name of jehovah
20  meanwhile orʹnan turned around and saw the angel and his four sons who were with him hid themselves
now orʹnan had been threshing wheat
21  when david came up to him orʹnan looked and saw david and he immediately went out from the threshing floor and bowed down to david with his face to the ground
22  david said to orʹnan sell me the site of the threshing floor so that i may build an altar to jehovah on it
sell it to me for the full price so that the scourge against the people may be halted
23  but orʹnan said to david take it as your own and let my lord the king do what seems good to him
here i am providing the cattle for burnt offerings and the threshing sledge for the wood and the wheat as a grain offering
i give all of it
24  however king david said to orʹnan no i must buy it for the full price because i will not take what is yours and give it to jehovah or offer up burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing
25  so david gave orʹnan 600 gold shekels by weight for the site
26  and david built an altar there to jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices and he called on jehovah who now answered him with fire from the heavens on the altar of burnt offering
27  then jehovah ordered the angel to return his sword to its sheath
28  at that time when david saw that jehovah had answered him at the threshing floor of orʹnan the jebʹusite he continued to sacrifice there
29  however the tabernacle of jehovah that moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at gibʹeon
30  but david had not been able to go before it to consult god for he was terrified because of the sword of jehovahs angel
25  further david and the chiefs of the groups for the service separated some of the sons of aʹsaph heʹman and jeduʹthun to serve by prophesying with the harps the stringed instruments and the cymbals
the list of the official men for this service was
2  of the sons of aʹsaph zacʹcur joseph nethaniʹah and ashareʹlah the sons of aʹsaph under the direction of aʹsaph who prophesied under the direction of the king
3  of jeduʹthun the sons of jeduʹthun gedaliʹah zeʹri jeshaʹiah shimʹei hashabiʹah and mattithiʹah six under the direction of their father jeduʹthun who prophesied with the harp thanking and praising jehovah
4  of heʹman the sons of heʹman bukkiʹah mattaniʹah uzʹziel shebʹuel jerʹimoth hananiʹah hanaʹni eliʹathah giddalʹti romamʹtieʹzer joshbekashʹah malloʹthi hoʹthir and mahaʹzioth
5  all of these were sons of heʹman a visionary of the king in matters pertaining to the true god to his glory thus the true god gave heʹman 14 sons and 3 daughters
6  all of these were under the direction of their father for singing at the house of jehovah with cymbals stringed instruments and harps for the service of the house of the true god
under the kings direction were aʹsaph jeduʹthun and heʹman
7  the number of them and their brothers who were trained in song to jehovah all experts was 288
8  so they cast lots for their duties the small and the great alike the expert along with the learner
9  the first lot to come out belonged to aʹsaph for joseph the second for gedaliʹah he and his brothers and his sons were 12
10  the third for zacʹcur his sons and his brothers 12
11  the fourth for izʹri his sons and his brothers 12
12  the fifth for nethaniʹah his sons and his brothers 12
13  the sixth for bukkiʹah his sons and his brothers 12
14  the seventh for jeshareʹlah his sons and his brothers 12
15  the eighth for jeshaʹiah his sons and his brothers 12
16  the ninth for mattaniʹah his sons and his brothers 12
17  the tenth for shimʹei his sons and his brothers 12
18  the 11th for azʹarel his sons and his brothers 12
19  the 12th for hashabiʹah his sons and his brothers 12
20  for the 13th shuʹbael his sons and his brothers 12
21  for the 14th mattithiʹah his sons and his brothers 12
22  for the 15th for jerʹemoth his sons and his brothers 12
23  for the 16th for hananiʹah his sons and his brothers 12
24  for the 17th for joshbekashʹah his sons and his brothers 12
25  for the 18th for hanaʹni his sons and his brothers 12
26  for the 19th for malloʹthi his sons and his brothers 12
27  for the 20th for eliʹathah his sons and his brothers 12
28  for the 21st for hoʹthir his sons and his brothers 12
29  for the 22nd for giddalʹti his sons and his brothers 12
30  for the 23rd for mahaʹzioth his sons and his brothers 12
31  for the 24th for romamʹtieʹzer his sons and his brothers 12
13  david consulted with the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and with every leader
2  then david said to all the congregation of israel if it seems good to you and it is acceptable to jehovah our god let us send word to our remaining brothers in all regions of israel and also to the priests and the levites in their cities with pastures to come and join us
3  and let us bring back the ark of our god
for they had not cared for it in the days of saul
4  all the congregation agreed to do that for it seemed right to all the people
5  so david congregated all israel from the river of egypt as far as leʹbohaʹmath to bring the ark of the true god from kirʹiathjeʹarim
6  david and all israel went up to baʹalah to kirʹiathjeʹarim which belongs to judah to bring up from there the ark of the true god jehovah who sits enthroned above the cherubs where his name is called on
7  however they placed the ark of the true god on a new wagon and brought it from the house of abinʹadab and uzʹzah and ahiʹo were leading the wagon
8  david and all israel were celebrating before the true god with all their might accompanied by songs harps other stringed instruments tambourines cymbals and trumpets
9  but when they came to the threshing floor of chiʹdon uzʹzah thrust his hand out and grabbed hold of the ark for the cattle nearly upset it
10  at that jehovahs anger blazed against uzʹzah and he struck him down because he had thrust his hand out to the ark and he died there before god
11  but david became angry because jehovahs wrath had broken through against uzʹzah and that place has been called peʹrezuzʹzah down to this day
12  so david became fearful of the true god on that day and said how can i bring the ark of the true god to me
13  david did not bring the ark to where he was in the city of david but he had it taken to the house of oʹbedeʹdom the gitʹtite
14  the ark of the true god was with the household of oʹbedeʹdom remaining at his house for three months and jehovah kept blessing the household of oʹbedeʹdom and all he had
14  king hiʹram of tyre sent messengers to david along with cedar timbers stonemasons and woodworkers to build a house for him
2  and david knew that jehovah had firmly established him as king over israel for his kingship was highly exalted for the sake of his people israel
3  david took more wives in jerusalem and david became father to more sons and daughters
4  these are the names of the children born to him in jerusalem shammuʹa shoʹbab nathan solʹomon
5  ibʹhar eliʹshua elʹpelet
6  noʹgah neʹpheg japhiʹa
7  elishʹama beeliʹada and eliphʹelet
8  when the philisʹtines heard that david had been anointed as king over all israel all the philisʹtines came up to search for david
when david heard about it he went out against them
9  then the philisʹtines came in and kept making raids in the valley of rephʹaim
10  david inquired of god saying should i go up against the philisʹtines will you give them into my hand at this jehovah said to him go up and i will surely give them into your hand
11  so david went up to baʹalperaʹzim and he struck them down there
at that david said the true god has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breach made by waters
that is why they named that place baʹalperaʹzim
12  the philisʹtines abandoned their gods there and when david gave the order these were burned in the fire
13  later the philisʹtines once again made a raid in the valley
14  david again inquired of god but the true god said to him do not go directly up after them
instead go around behind them and come against them in front of the baʹca bushes
15  and when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baʹca bushes launch your attack for the true god will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the philisʹtines
16  so david did just as the true god commanded him and they struck down the philisʹtine army from gibʹeon to geʹzer
17  and davids fame spread into all the lands and jehovah put the dread of him upon all the nations
29  king david now said to all the congregation my son solʹomon the one whom god has chosen is young and inexperienced and the work is great for it is not a temple for man but for jehovah god
2  and i have spared no effort to prepare for the house of my god providing the gold for the goldwork the silver for the silverwork the copper for the copperwork the iron for the ironwork the timbers for the timberwork onyx stones and stones to be set with mortar mosaic pebbles every kind of precious stone and alabaster stones in great quantity
3  moreover because of my delight in the house of my god there is also my private treasure of gold and silver that i am giving to the house of my god in addition to all that i have prepared for the holy house
4  including 3000 talents of gold from oʹphir and 7000 talents of refined silver for coating the walls of the houses
5  the gold for the goldwork and the silver for the silverwork and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen
now who volunteers to come forward today with a gift in hand for jehovah
6  so the princes of the paternal houses the princes of the tribes of israel the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds and the chiefs of the business of the king came forward voluntarily
7  and they gave to the service of the house of the true god 5000 talents of gold 10000 darics 10000 talents of silver 18000 talents of copper and 100000 talents of iron
8  whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of jehovah under the care of jehiʹel the gerʹshonite
9  the people rejoiced over making these voluntary offerings for they made the voluntary offerings to jehovah with a complete heart and david the king also rejoiced greatly
10  then david praised jehovah before the eyes of all the congregation
david said may you be praised o jehovah the god of israel our father throughout all eternity
11  yours o jehovah are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours
yours is the kingdom o jehovah
you are the one exalting yourself as head over all
12  the riches and the glory are from you and you rule over everything and in your hand there are power and mightiness and your hand is able to make great and to give strength to all
13  and now o our god we thank you and praise your beautiful name
14  and yet who am i and who are my people that we should be in a position to make voluntary offerings like this for everything is from you and we have given to you what comes from your own hand
15  for we are foreign residents in your presence and settlers just like all our forefathers
for our days on the earth are like a shadowwithout hope
16  o jehovah our god all this wealth that we have prepared to build for you a house for your holy name is from your own hand and it all belongs to you
17  i well know o my god that you examine the heart and that you take pleasure in integrity
in the uprightness of my heart i have voluntarily offered all these things and i am overjoyed to see your people who are present here make voluntary offerings to you
18  o jehovah the god of abraham isaac and israel our forefathers keep these inclinations and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever and direct their hearts to you
19  and give a complete heart to my son solʹomon so that he may observe your commandments your reminders and your regulations and do all these things and build the temple for which i have made preparation
20  david then said to all the congregation now praise jehovah your god
and all the congregation praised jehovah the god of their forefathers and bowed low and prostrated themselves to jehovah and to the king
21  and they continued to offer sacrifices to jehovah and to offer up burnt offerings to jehovah on the following day 1000 young bulls 1000 rams 1000 male lambs and their drink offerings they offered sacrifices in great number for all israel
22  they continued eating and drinking before jehovah on that day with great rejoicing and for a second time they made solʹomon the son of david king and anointed him before jehovah as leader and also zaʹdok as priest
23  and solʹomon sat on jehovahs throne as king in place of david his father and he was successful and all the israelites were obedient to him
24  all the princes the mighty warriors and also all the sons of king david submitted themselves to solʹomon the king
25  and jehovah made solʹomon exceedingly great before the eyes of all israel and bestowed on him royal majesty such as no king over israel ever had before
26  thus david the son of jesʹse reigned over all israel
27  and the length of his reign over israel was 40 years
in hebʹron he reigned for 7 years and in jerusalem he reigned for 33 years
28  and he died at a good old age satisfied with long life wealth and glory and his son solʹomon became king in his place
29  as for the history of king david from beginning to end it is written among the words of samuel the seer nathan the prophet and gad the visionary
30  together with all his kingship his mightiness and the events of the times involving him and israel and all the surrounding kingdoms
19  later naʹhash the king of the amʹmonites died and his son became king in his place
2  at that david said i will show loyal love toward haʹnun the son of naʹhash because his father showed loyal love toward me
so david sent messengers to offer him comfort over the loss of his father
but when davids servants came into the land of the amʹmonites to comfort haʹnun
3  the princes of the amʹmonites said to haʹnun do you think that david is honoring your father by sending comforters to you is it not to make a thorough search and to overthrow you and to spy out the land that his servants have come to you
4  so haʹnun took the servants of david and shaved them and cut their garments in half at their buttocks and sent them away
5  when david was told about the men he at once sent others to meet them because the men had been deeply humiliated and the king told them stay in jerʹicho until your beards grow back and then return
6  in time the amʹmonites saw that they had become a stench to david so haʹnun and the amʹmonites sent 1000 silver talents to hire chariots and horsemen from mesopotaʹmia aʹrammaʹacah and zoʹbah
7  thus they hired 32000 chariots along with the king of maʹacah and his people
then they came and camped before medʹeba
the amʹmonites gathered together from their cities and came out for the battle
8  when david heard about it he sent joʹab and the entire army including his mightiest warriors
9  and the amʹmonites went out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the city while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open field
10  when joʹab saw that the battle charges were coming against him from the front and the rear he chose some of the best troops in israel and drew them up in battle formation to meet the syrians
11  he put the rest of the men under the command of his brother abishʹai in order to draw them up in battle formation to meet the amʹmonites
12  then he said if the syrians become too strong for me then you must come to my rescue but if the amʹmonites become too strong for you i will rescue you
13  we must be strong and courageous for our people and for the cities of our god and jehovah will do what is good in his eyes
14  then joʹab and his men advanced to meet the syrians in battle and they fled from before him
15  when the amʹmonites saw that the syrians had fled they also fled from his brother abishʹai and went into the city
after that joʹab came to jerusalem
16  when the syrians saw that they had been defeated by israel they sent messengers to summon the syrians in the region of the river with shoʹphach the chief of the army of hadadeʹzer leading them
17  when the report was made to david he immediately gathered all israel and crossed the jordan and came to them and drew up in battle formation against them
david drew up in battle formation to meet the syrians and they fought against him
18  but the syrians fled from israel and david killed 7000 charioteers and 40000 foot soldiers of the syrians and he put shoʹphach the chief of the army to death
19  when the servants of hadadeʹzer saw that they had been defeated by israel they promptly made peace with david and became his subjects and syria did not want to help the amʹmonites anymore
24  now the divisions of the descendants of aaron were these the sons of aaron were naʹdab abiʹhu eleaʹzar and ithʹamar
2  however naʹdab and abiʹhu died before their father and they did not have any sons but eleaʹzar and ithʹamar continued to serve as priests
3  david along with zaʹdok from the sons of eleaʹzar and ahimʹelech from the sons of ithʹamar made divisions of them for the office of their service
4  since the sons of eleaʹzar had more headmen than the sons of ithʹamar had they divided them accordingly the sons of eleaʹzar had 16 as heads of their paternal houses and the sons of ithʹamar had 8 as heads of their paternal houses
5  further they divided them by lots the one group along with the other for there were chiefs of the holy place and chiefs of the true god from both the sons of eleaʹzar and the sons of ithʹamar
6  then shemaiʹah the son of nethanʹel the secretary of the levites recorded their names before the king the princes zaʹdok the priest ahimʹelech the son of abiʹathar and the heads of the paternal houses of the priests and of the levites one paternal house being selected for eleaʹzar and one being selected for ithʹamar
7  the first lot came out to jehoiʹarib the second to jedaʹiah
8  the third to haʹrim the fourth to seoʹrim
9  the fifth to malchiʹjah the sixth to mijʹamin
10  the seventh to hakʹkoz the eighth to abiʹjah
11  the ninth to jeshʹua the tenth to shecaniʹah
12  the 11th to eliʹashib the 12th to jaʹkim
13  the 13th to hupʹpah the 14th to jeshebʹeab
14  the 15th to bilʹgah the 16th to imʹmer
15  the 17th to heʹzir the 18th to hapʹpizzez
16  the 19th to pethahiʹah the 20th to jehezʹkel
17  the 21st to jaʹchin the 22nd to gaʹmul
18  the 23rd to delaʹiah the 24th to maaziʹah
19  these were their offices for their service when they would come into the house of jehovah according to the procedure set by their forefather aaron just as jehovah the god of israel had commanded him
20  and of the rest of the levites of the sons of amʹram there was shuʹbael of the sons of shuʹbael jehdeʹiah

regarding the paternal houses the head one was just as his younger brother
5  these are the sons of reuʹben israels firstborn
he was the firstborn but because he defiled the bed of his father his right as firstborn was given to the sons of joseph the son of israel so he was not enrolled genealogically for the right of the firstborn
2  though judah was superior to his brothers and from him came the one to be the leader the right as firstborn belonged to joseph
3  the sons of reuʹben the firstborn of israel were haʹnoch palʹlu hezʹron and carʹmi
4  the sons of joel were shemaiʹah his son gog his son shimʹei his son
5  miʹcah his son reaʹiah his son baʹal his son
6  and beerʹah his son whom king tilʹgathpilneʹser of assyrʹia took into exile he was a chieftain of the reuʹbenites

9  to the east he settled as far as the beginning of the wilderness at the euphraʹtes river for their livestock had become numerous in the land of gilʹead
10  in the days of saul they waged war against the hagʹrites who were defeated before them so they dwelled in their tents throughout all the territory east of gilʹead
11  now the descendants of gad lived next to them in the land of baʹshan as far as salʹecah
12  joel was the head shaʹpham the second and jaʹnai and shaʹphat in baʹshan
13  and their brothers belonging to their paternal houses were miʹchael meshulʹlam sheʹba joʹrai jaʹcan ziʹa and eʹber seven in all

15  aʹhi son of abʹdiel son of guʹni was head of their paternal house
16  they lived in gilʹead in baʹshan and its dependent towns and in all the pastures of sharʹon as far as they extended
17  they were all enrolled genealogically in the days of king joʹtham of judah and in the days of king jeroboʹam of israel
18  the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh had 44760 mighty warriors in their army who carried shields and swords and were armed with bows and they were trained in war
19  they waged war against the hagʹrites jeʹtur naʹphish and noʹdab
20  and they were helped in fighting them so that the hagʹrites and all who were with them were given into their hand for they called to god for help in the war and he responded to their entreaty because they trusted in him
21  they captured their livestock50000 camels 250000 sheep and 2000 donkeysas well as 100000 people
22  many had fallen slain because the war was waged by the true god
and they lived in their place until the time of the exile
23  the descendants of the half tribe of manasʹseh lived in the land from baʹshan to baʹalherʹmon and seʹnir and mount herʹmon
they were numerous
24  these were the heads of their paternal houses eʹpher ishʹi eʹliel azʹriel jeremiah hodaviʹah and jahʹdiel they were mighty warriors men of fame and heads of their paternal houses
25  but they acted unfaithfully toward the god of their forefathers and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land whom god had annihilated from before them
26  so the god of israel stirred up the spirit of king pul of assyrʹia that is king tilʹgathpilneʹser of assyrʹia so that he took into exile those of the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh and brought them to haʹlah haʹbor haʹra and the river goʹzan where they are until this day
15  and he continued building houses for himself in the city of david and he prepared a place for the ark of the true god and pitched a tent for it
2  it was then that david said no one is to carry the ark of the true god except the levites for jehovah has chosen them to carry the ark of jehovah and to minister to him always
3  then david congregated all israel at jerusalem to bring the ark of jehovah up to the place that he had prepared for it
4  david gathered the descendants of aaron and the levites
5  from the koʹhathites uriʹel the chief and 120 of his brothers
6  from the merarʹites asaiʹah the chief and 220 of his brothers
7  from the gerʹshomites joel the chief and 130 of his brothers
8  from the descendants of elizaʹphan shemaiʹah the chief and 200 of his brothers
9  from the descendants of hebʹron eʹliel the chief and 80 of his brothers
10  from the descendants of uzʹziel amminʹadab the chief and 112 of his brothers
11  furthermore david called the priests zaʹdok and abiʹathar and the levites uriʹel asaiʹah joel shemaiʹah eʹliel and amminʹadab
12  and he said to them you are the heads of the paternal houses of the levites
sanctify yourselves you and your brothers and bring the ark of jehovah the god of israel up to the place that i have prepared for it
13  since you did not carry it the first time the anger of jehovah our god broke out against us because we did not search out the proper procedure
14  so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of jehovah the god of israel
15  then the levites carried the ark of the true god on their shoulders with the poles just as moses had commanded by jehovahs word
16  david then told the chiefs of the levites to appoint their brothers the singers to sing out joyfully accompanied by musical instruments stringed instruments harps and cymbals
17  so the levites appointed heʹman the son of joel and of his brothers aʹsaph the son of berechiʹah and of the merarʹites their brothers eʹthan the son of kushaʹiah
18  together with them were their brothers of the second division zechariʹah ben jaaʹziel shemirʹamoth jehiʹel unʹni eliʹab benaiʹah maaseiʹah mattithiʹah eliphʹelehu and mikneʹiah and oʹbedeʹdom and jeiʹel the gatekeepers
19  the singers heʹman aʹsaph and eʹthan were to play the copper cymbals
20  and zechariʹah aʹziel shemirʹamoth jehiʹel unʹni eliʹab maaseiʹah and benaiʹah played stringed instruments tuned to alʹamoth
21  and mattithiʹah eliphʹelehu mikneʹiah oʹbedeʹdom jeiʹel and azaziʹah played harps tuned to shemʹinith to act as directors
22  chenaniʹah the chief of the levites supervised the transport for he was an expert
23  and berechiʹah and elkaʹnah were gatekeepers for the ark
24  the priests shebaniʹah joshʹaphat nethanʹel amaʹsai zechariʹah benaiʹah and elieʹzer loudly sounded the trumpets before the ark of the true god and oʹbedeʹdom and jehiʹah also served as gatekeepers for the ark
25  then david and the elders of israel and the chiefs of the thousands were walking along to bring the ark of the covenant of jehovah up from the house of oʹbedeʹdom with rejoicing
26  when the true god helped the levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of jehovah they sacrificed seven young bulls and seven rams
27  david was dressed in a sleeveless coat of fine fabric as were all the levites carrying the ark the singers and chenaniʹah the chief of the transport and the singers david was also wearing a linen ephʹod
28  all the israelites were bringing up the ark of the covenant of jehovah with joyful shouting with the sound of the horn with trumpets with cymbals playing loudly on stringed instruments and harps
29  but when the ark of the covenant of jehovah came to the city of david sauls daughter miʹchal looked down through the window and saw king david skipping about and celebrating and she began to despise him in her heart
20  at the start of the year at the time when kings go on campaigns joʹab led a military expedition and devastated the land of the amʹmonites he came and besieged rabʹbah while david stayed in jerusalem
joʹab attacked rabʹbah and tore it down
2  then david took the crown of malʹcam from its head and found that it weighed a talent of gold and in it there were precious stones and it was placed on davids head
he also took a vast amount of spoil from the city
3  and he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work at sawing stones and at working with sharp iron instruments and with axes
that was what david did to all the cities of the amʹmonites
finally david and all the troops returned to jerusalem
4  after this war broke out at geʹzer with the philisʹtines
at that time sibʹbecai the huʹshathite struck down sipʹpai who was a descendant of the rephʹaim and they were subdued
5  and there was war again with the philisʹtines and elhaʹnan the son of jaʹir struck down lahʹmi the brother of goliʹath the gitʹtite whose spear had a shaft like the beam of loom workers
6  war broke out yet again at gath where there was a man of extraordinary size with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot 24 in all and he too was a descendant of the rephʹaim
7  he kept taunting israel
so jonʹathan the son of shimʹea davids brother struck him down
