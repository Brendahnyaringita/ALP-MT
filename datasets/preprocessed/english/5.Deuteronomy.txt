10  at that time jehovah said to me carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain also you must make for yourself an ark of wood
2  and i will write on the tablets the words that appeared on the first tablets which you shattered and you should place them in the ark
3  so i made an ark of acacia wood and carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand
4  then he wrote on the tablets the words he had written before the ten commandments which jehovah had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly and jehovah gave them to me
5  then i turned and went down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark that i had made where they remain just as jehovah had commanded me
6  the israelites then departed from beerʹoth benʹejaʹakan for moseʹrah
there aaron died and was buried and his son eleaʹzar began to serve as priest in his place
7  from there they departed for gudʹgodah and from gudʹgodah for jotʹbathah a land flowing with streams of water
8  at that time jehovah set apart the tribe of leʹvi to carry the ark of jehovahs covenant to stand before jehovah in order to minister to him and to bless in his name as they do to this day
9  that is why leʹvi has no share or inheritance with his brothers
jehovah is his inheritance just as jehovah your god had said to him
10  i myself stayed on the mountain as i did the first time 40 days and 40 nights and jehovah listened to me on that occasion also
jehovah did not want to destroy you
11  then jehovah said to me go ahead of the people and prepare to depart so that they may go in and take possession of the land that i have sworn to their forefathers to give to them
12  now o israel what is jehovah your god asking of you only this to fear jehovah your god to walk in all his ways to love him to serve jehovah your god with all your heart and all your soul
13  and to keep the commandments and statutes of jehovah that i am commanding you today for your own good
14  look to jehovah your god belong the heavens even the heavens of the heavens and the earth with all that is in it
15  but only to your forefathers did jehovah draw close and express his love and he has chosen you their offspring out of all the peoples as you are today
16  you must now cleanse your hearts and stop being so stubborn
17  for jehovah your god is the god of gods and the lord of lords the god great mighty and aweinspiring who treats none with partiality and does not accept a bribe
18  he executes justice for the fatherless child and the widow and loves the foreign resident giving him food and clothing
19  you too must love the foreign resident for you became foreign residents in the land of egypt
20  jehovah your god you should fear him you should serve to him you should cling and by his name you should swear
21  he is the one you are to praise
he is your god who has done all these great and aweinspiring things for you that your own eyes have seen
22  with 70 people your forefathers went down into egypt and now jehovah your god has made you as numerous as the stars of the heavens
4  now o israel listen to the regulations and the judicial decisions that i am teaching you to observe so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land that jehovah the god of your forefathers is giving you
2  you must not add to the word that i am commanding you neither must you take away from it so as to keep the commandments of jehovah your god that i am commanding you
3  your own eyes have seen what jehovah did in the case of the baʹal of peʹor jehovah your god annihilated from your midst every man who walked after the baʹal of peʹor
4  but you who are holding fast to jehovah your god are all alive today
5  see i have taught you regulations and judicial decisions just as jehovah my god has commanded me so that you may observe them in the land you will take possession of
6  you must carefully follow them because this will show wisdom and understanding on your part before the peoples who will hear about all these regulations and they will say this great nation is undoubtedly a wise and understanding people
7  for what great nation has gods as near to it as jehovah our god is to us whenever we call on him
8  and what great nation has righteous regulations and judicial decisions like this entire law that i am putting before you today
9  just be careful and watch yourself closely so that you may not forget the things that your eyes have seen and so that they may not depart from your heart all the days of your life
you must also make them known to your sons and to your grandsons
10  on the day that you stood before jehovah your god in hoʹreb jehovah said to me congregate the people together to me so that i may let them hear my words in order that they may learn to fear me all the days that they are alive on the ground and that they may teach their sons
11  so you came near and stood at the base of the mountain and the mountain was burning with fire up to the very heavens there was darkness cloud and thick gloom
12  and jehovah began to speak to you out of the fire
you heard the sound of words but you saw no formthere was only a voice
13  and he declared his covenant to you which he commanded you to observethe ten commandments
afterward he wrote them on two tablets of stone
14  at that time jehovah commanded me to teach you regulations and judicial decisions which you are to observe in the land you will enter to take possession of
15  therefore watch yourselves closelysince you did not see any form on the day jehovah spoke to you in hoʹreb out of the middle of the fire
16  that you may not act corruptly by making for yourselves any carved image having the form of any symbol the representation of male or female
17  the representation of any animal on the earth or the representation of any bird that flies in the sky
18  the representation of anything creeping on the ground or the representation of any fish in the waters under the earth
19  and when you raise your eyes to the heavens and see the sun and the moon and the starsall the army of the heavensdo not get seduced and bow down to them and serve them
jehovah your god has given them to all the peoples under the whole heavens
20  but you are the ones jehovah took and brought out of the ironsmelting furnace out of egypt to become the people of his personal possession as you are today
21  jehovah became angry with me because of you and he swore that i should not cross the jordan or go into the good land that jehovah your god is giving you as an inheritance
22  for i am to die in this land i will not cross the jordan but you will cross over and take possession of this good land
23  be careful that you do not forget the covenant of jehovah your god that he made with you and do not make for yourselves a carved image the form of anything forbidden to you by jehovah your god
24  for jehovah your god is a consuming fire a god who requires exclusive devotion
25  if you become father to sons and grandsons and you have lived a long time in the land and you act ruinously and make a carved image of any kind and you do what is evil in the eyes of jehovah your god so as to offend him
26  i do take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that you will surely and quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the jordan to take possession of
you will not last long on it but you will be utterly annihilated
27  jehovah will scatter you among the peoples and just a few of you will survive among the nations to which jehovah will have driven you
28  there you will have to serve gods of wood and stone made by human hands gods that cannot see or hear or eat or smell
29  if you search for jehovah your god from there you will certainly find him if you inquire for him with all your heart and with all your soul
30  when you are in great distress and all these things have happened to you in later times then you will return to jehovah your god and listen to his voice
31  for jehovah your god is a merciful god
he will not desert you or bring you to ruin or forget the covenant that he swore to your forefathers
32  ask now about the former days before your time from the day when god created man on the earth search from one end of the heavens to the other end of the heavens
has anything so great ever happened or has anything like it ever been heard of
33  have any other people heard the voice of god speaking out of the fire the way you have heard it and kept on living
34  or has god ever attempted to take for himself a nation out of the midst of another nation along with judgments with signs with miracles with war with a mighty hand with an outstretched arm and with terrifying deeds as jehovah your god did for you in egypt before your very eyes
35  you yourselves have been shown these things so you will know that jehovah is the true god there is no other besides him
36  he made you hear his voice from the heavens to correct you and on the earth he made you see his great fire and his words you heard from out of the fire
37  because he loved your forefathers and has chosen their offspring after them you were brought out of egypt in his presence by his great power
38  from before you he drove away nations greater and mightier than you to bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance as it is today
39  know therefore on this day and take it to heart that jehovah is the true god in the heavens above and on the earth beneath
there is no other
40  you must keep his regulations and his commandments that i am commanding you today in order that it may go well with you and your sons after you so that you may long remain in the land that jehovah your god is giving you
41  at that time moses set apart three cities on the eastern side of the jordan
42  if any manslayer unintentionally kills his fellow man and he did not previously hate him he must flee to one of these cities and live
43  the cities are beʹzer in the wilderness on the tableland for the reuʹbenites raʹmoth in gilʹead for the gadʹites and goʹlan in baʹshan for the manasʹsites
44  now this is the law that moses set before the people of israel
45  these are the reminders the regulations and the judicial decisions that moses gave to the israelites after they came out of egypt
46  in the region of the jordan in the valley opposite bethpeʹor in the land of king siʹhon of the amʹorites who was dwelling in heshʹbon whom moses and the israelites defeated after coming out of egypt
47  and they took possession of his land and of the land of king og of baʹshan the two kings of the amʹorites who were in the region east of the jordan
48  from aroʹer which is on the rim of the arʹnon valley up to mount siʹon that is herʹmon
49  and all the arʹabah in the region east of the jordan and as far as the sea of the arʹabah at the base of the slopes of pisʹgah
26  when eventually you enter into the land that jehovah your god is giving you as an inheritance and you have taken possession of it and are dwelling in it
2  you are to take some of the firstfruits of all the produce of the ground which you will gather from your land that jehovah your god is giving you and put them in a basket and go to the place that jehovah your god chooses to have his name reside
3  you must go to the priest who will be serving in those days and say to him today i am reporting to jehovah your god that i have come into the land that jehovah swore to our forefathers to give to us
4  the priest will then take the basket out of your hand and deposit it before the altar of jehovah your god
5  then you are to declare before jehovah your god my father was a wandering aramaeʹan and he went down to egypt and resided there as a foreigner with few in his household
but there he became a great nation mighty and numerous
6  and the egyptians mistreated and oppressed us and imposed harsh slavery on us
7  so we began to cry out to jehovah the god of our forefathers and jehovah heard our voice and looked upon our affliction and our trouble and our oppression
8  finally jehovah brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with terrifying deeds and with signs and miracles
9  then he brought us to this place and gave us this land a land flowing with milk and honey
10  now i have brought the firstfruits of the produce of the ground that jehovah has given me
you must deposit it before jehovah your god and bow down before jehovah your god
11  you will then rejoice over all the good that jehovah your god has given you and your household you and the levite and the foreign resident who is among you
12  when you finish tithing the entire tenth of your produce in the third year the year of the tenth you will give it to the levite the foreign resident the fatherless child and the widow and they will eat their fill within your cities
13  you will then say before jehovah your god i have cleared the holy portion out of my house and given it to the levite the foreign resident the fatherless child and the widow just as you have commanded me
i have not violated or neglected your commandments
14  i have not eaten of it while mourning or removed any of it while unclean or given any of it for the dead
i have obeyed the voice of jehovah my god and have done all that you commanded me
15  now look down from your holy dwelling the heavens and bless your people israel and the land that you have given us just as you swore to our forefathers the land flowing with milk and honey
16  this day jehovah your god is commanding you to carry out these regulations and judicial decisions
you must observe them and carry them out with all your heart and all your soul
17  today you have obtained jehovahs declaration that he will become your god as you walk in his ways and observe his regulations his commandments and his judicial decisions and as you listen to his voice
18  and today jehovah has obtained your declaration that you will become his people his special property just as he has promised you and that you will observe all his commandments
19  and that he will put you high above all the other nations that he has made giving you praise and fame and glory as you prove yourself a people holy to jehovah your god just as he has promised
11  you must love jehovah your god and always keep your obligation to him and his statutes his judicial decisions and his commandments
2  you know that today i am addressing you not your sons who have not known or seen the discipline of jehovah your god his greatness his mighty hand and his outstretched arm
3  they did not see his signs and his deeds that he did in egypt to pharʹaoh king of egypt and to all his land
4  or what he did to the armies of egypt to pharʹaohs horses and war chariots which were overwhelmed by the waters of the red sea when they were chasing after you and jehovah destroyed them once and for all
5  they did not see what he has done for you in the wilderness until your coming to this place
6  or what he did to daʹthan and abiʹram the sons of eliʹab the son of reuʹben when the earth opened and swallowed them up along with their households and their tents and every living thing that followed them before the eyes of all israel
7  your own eyes have seen all the great deeds that jehovah did
8  you must keep the whole commandment that i am giving you today so that you may grow strong and cross over into the land to take possession of it
9  and so that you may live long in the land that jehovah swore to give to your forefathers and their offspring a land flowing with milk and honey
10  the land you are going to take possession of is not like the land of egypt out of which you came where you used to sow your seed and irrigate it with your foot like a garden of vegetables
11  but the land you are about to cross into and possess is a land of mountains and valley plains
it drinks the water that rains from the heavens
12  it is a land that jehovah your god is caring for
the eyes of jehovah your god are constantly upon it from the beginning of the year to the close of the year
13  and if you will diligently obey my commandments that i am commanding you today and love jehovah your god and serve him with all your heart and all your soul
14  i will also give rain for your land at its appointed time autumn rain and spring rain and you will gather your grain and your new wine and your oil
15  and i will provide vegetation in your fields for your livestock and you will eat and be satisfied
16  be careful not to let your heart be enticed to go astray and worship other gods and bow down to them
17  otherwise jehovahs anger will blaze against you and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will not give its produce and you will quickly perish from the good land that jehovah is giving you
18  you must impress these words of mine on your heart and your soul and bind them as a reminder on your hand and they should be like a headband on your forehead
19  teach them to your children speaking about them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up
20  write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates
21  so that you and your sons may live long in the land that jehovah swore to give to your forefathers for as long as the heavens are over the earth
22  if you strictly observe this commandment that i am giving you and you carry it out to love jehovah your god to walk in all his ways and to cling to him
23  jehovah will drive away all these nations from before you and you will dispossess nations greater and more numerous than you are
24  every place you set your foot will become yours
from the wilderness up to lebʹanon from the river the river euphraʹtes to the western sea your boundary will become
25  nobody will stand up to you
jehovah your god will spread the dread and the fear of you over the whole land on which you walk just as he promised you
26  see i am putting before you today a blessing and a curse
27  the blessing if you obey the commandments of jehovah your god that i am commanding you today
28  and the curse if you do not obey the commandments of jehovah your god and you turn aside from the way i am commanding you to follow today and you follow gods that you have not known
29  when jehovah your god brings you into the land you are to possess you must pronounce the blessing on mount gerʹizim and the curse on mount eʹbal
30  are they not on the other side of the jordan toward the west in the land of the caʹnaanites who live in the arʹabah opposite gilʹgal beside the big trees of moʹreh
31  for you are crossing the jordan to enter and take possession of the land that jehovah your god is giving you
when you take possession of it and live in it
32  you must be careful to carry out all the regulations and the judicial decisions that i am putting before you today
8  you should be careful to observe every commandment that i am giving you today so that you may continue living and multiply and go in and take possession of the land about which jehovah swore to your forefathers
2  remember the long road that jehovah your god made you walk these 40 years in the wilderness to humble you and to put you to the test so as to know what was in your heart whether you would keep his commandments or not
3  so he humbled you and let you go hungry and fed you with the manna which neither you had known nor your fathers had known in order to make you know that man does not live by bread alone but man lives by every expression from jehovahs mouth
4  the clothing you wore did not wear out nor did your feet become swollen these 40 years
5  you well know in your heart that just as a man corrects his son jehovah your god was correcting you
6  now you must keep the commandments of jehovah your god by walking in his ways and by fearing him
7  for jehovah your god is bringing you into a good land a land of streams of water springs and fountains flowing in the valley plain and in the mountainous region
8  a land of wheat and barley of grapevines fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey
9  a land where food will not be scarce and you will lack nothing a land where the stones contain iron and from its mountains you will mine copper
10  when you have eaten and are satisfied you must praise jehovah your god for the good land that he has given you
11  be careful not to forget jehovah your god by failing to keep his commandments his judicial decisions and his statutes that i am commanding you today
12  when you eat and are satisfied and you build fine houses and dwell in them
13  when your herd and your flocks multiply and your silver and gold increase and you have an abundance of everything
14  do not let your heart become proud and cause you to forget jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt out of the house of slavery
15  who caused you to walk through the great and fearsome wilderness with poisonous serpents and scorpions and with parched ground that has no water
he made water flow out of the flinty rock
16  and fed you with manna in the wilderness which your fathers had not known in order to humble you and to put you to the test so as to benefit you in the future
17  if you should say in your heart my own power and the strength of my own hand have produced this wealth for me
18  remember that it is jehovah your god who gives power to you to make wealth in order to carry out his covenant that he swore to your forefathers as it is today
19  if you should ever forget jehovah your god and you walk after other gods and serve them and bow down to them i do bear witness against you today that you will surely perish
20  like the nations that jehovah is destroying before you that is how you will perish because you would not listen to the voice of jehovah your god
30  when all these words come upon you the blessing and the curse that i have put before you and you call them to mind in all the nations where jehovah your god has dispersed you
2  and you return to jehovah your god and listen to his voice according to all that i am commanding you today you and your sons with all your heart and all your soul
3  jehovah your god will then bring back your captives and show you mercy and regather you from all the peoples where jehovah your god has scattered you
4  even if your people are dispersed to the extremity of the heavens from there jehovah your god will gather you and bring you back
5  jehovah your god will bring you into the land your fathers took possession of and you will possess it and he will make you prosper and will multiply you more than your fathers
6  jehovah your god will cleanse your heart and the heart of your offspring so that you will love jehovah your god with all your heart and all your soul and you may live
7  then jehovah your god will bring all these curses upon your enemies who hated and persecuted you
8  you will then return and listen to the voice of jehovah and observe all his commandments that i am commanding you today
9  jehovah your god will make you abundantly prosperous in all the work of your hands multiplying your children and your livestock and the produce of your ground for jehovah will again delight to make you prosper just as he delighted in your forefathers
10  for then you will listen to the voice of jehovah your god and keep his commandments and statutes written in this book of the law and you will return to jehovah your god with all your heart and all your soul
11  now this commandment that i am commanding you today is not too difficult for you nor is it beyond your reach
12  it is not in the heavens so that you have to say who will ascend to the heavens and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it
13  nor is it on the other side of the sea so that you have to say who will cross over to the other side of the sea and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it
14  for the word is very near you in your own mouth and in your own heart so that you may do it
15  see i do put before you today life and good and death and bad
16  if you listen to the commandments of jehovah your god that i am commanding you today by loving jehovah your god by walking in his ways and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his judicial decisions then you will live and multiply and jehovah your god will bless you in the land you are going to possess
17  but if your heart turns away and you do not listen and you are enticed and bow down to other gods and serve them
18  i tell you today that you will certainly perish
you will not live long in the land you are crossing the jordan to possess
19  i take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that i have put life and death before you the blessing and the curse and you must choose life so that you may live you and your descendants
20  by loving jehovah your god by listening to his voice and by sticking to him for he is your life and by him you will endure a long time in the land that jehovah swore to give to your forefathers abraham isaac and jacob
16  observe the month of aʹbib and celebrate the passover to jehovah your god for in the month of aʹbib jehovah your god brought you out of egypt by night
2  and you should sacrifice the passover offering to jehovah your god from the flock and the herd in the place that jehovah chooses to have his name reside
3  you must not eat anything leavened along with it for seven days you should eat unleavened bread the bread of affliction because you came out of the land of egypt in haste
do this so that you may remember the day you came out of the land of egypt as long as you live
4  no sourdough should be found with you in all your territory for seven days nor should any of the meat that you will sacrifice in the evening on the first day remain all night until the next morning
5  you will not be allowed to sacrifice the passover offering in just any of the cities that jehovah your god is giving you
6  but it should be done at the place that jehovah your god chooses to have his name reside
you should sacrifice the passover offering in the evening as soon as the sun sets at the appointed time of your coming out of egypt
7  you must cook it and eat it in the place that jehovah your god will choose and in the morning you may return to your own tents
8  six days you should eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day there will be a solemn assembly to jehovah your god
you must do no work
9  you should count off seven weeks
you should begin counting off seven weeks from the time you first put the sickle to the standing grain
10  then you are to celebrate the festival of weeks to jehovah your god with the voluntary offering from your hand given in proportion to how jehovah your god blesses you
11  and you are to rejoice before jehovah your god you and your son your daughter your male slave your female slave the levite who is inside your cities the foreign resident the fatherless child and the widow who are in your midst in the place that jehovah your god chooses to have his name reside
12  remember that you became a slave in egypt and observe and carry out these regulations
13  you should celebrate the festival of booths for seven days when you make an ingathering from your threshing floor and from your press for oil and wine
14  rejoice during your festival you and your son your daughter your male slave your female slave the levite the foreign resident the fatherless child and the widow who are inside your cities
15  seven days you will celebrate the festival to jehovah your god in the place that jehovah chooses for jehovah your god will bless all your produce and all that you do and you will become nothing but joyful
16  three times a year all your males should appear before jehovah your god in the place that he chooses at the festival of unleavened bread the festival of weeks and the festival of booths and none of them should appear before jehovah emptyhanded
17  the gift that each one brings should be in proportion to the blessing that jehovah your god has given you
18  you should appoint judges and officers for each tribe in all the cities that jehovah your god is giving you and they must judge the people with righteous judgment
19  you must not pervert justice show partiality or accept a bribe for the bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and distorts the words of the righteous
20  justicejustice you should pursue so that you may keep living and take possession of the land that jehovah your god is giving you
21  you should not plant any sort of tree as a sacred pole near the altar of jehovah your god that you make for yourself
22  neither should you set up a sacred pillar for yourself something jehovah your god hates
18  the levitical priests and indeed the entire tribe of leʹvi will have no share or inheritance with israel
they will eat of the offerings made by fire to jehovah which are his inheritance
2  so they should have no inheritance in the midst of their brothers
jehovah is their inheritance just as he has spoken to them
3  now this will be the due right of the priests from the people whoever makes a sacrifice whether a bull or a sheep is to give the shoulder the jaws and the stomach to the priest
4  the firstfruits of your grain your new wine your oil and the first wool that is shorn from your flock you should give him
5  jehovah your god has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes to minister in the name of jehovah always
6  but if a levite leaves one of your cities in israel where he was living and he desires to go to the place that jehovah chooses
7  he may minister there in the name of jehovah his god the same as all his brothers the levites who are stationed there before jehovah
8  he will receive an equal share of food with them in addition to what he receives from selling his ancestral possessions
9  when you have entered into the land that jehovah your god is giving you you must not learn to imitate the detestable practices of those nations
10  there should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire anyone who employs divination anyone practicing magic anyone who looks for omens a sorcerer
11  anyone binding others with a spell anyone who consults a spirit medium or a fortuneteller or anyone who inquires of the dead
12  for whoever does these things is detestable to jehovah and on account of these detestable practices jehovah your god is driving them away from before you
13  you should prove yourself blameless before jehovah your god
14  for these nations that you are dispossessing used to listen to those practicing magic and divination but jehovah your god has not allowed you to do anything like this
15  jehovah your god will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me
you must listen to him
16  this is in response to what you asked of jehovah your god in hoʹreb on the day of the assembly when you said do not let me hear the voice of jehovah my god or see this great fire anymore so that i do not die
17  then jehovah said to me what they have said is good
18  i will raise up for them from the midst of their brothers a prophet like you and i will put my words in his mouth and he will speak to them all that i command him
19  indeed i will require an account from the man who will not listen to my words that he will speak in my name
20  if any prophet presumptuously speaks a word in my name that i did not command him to speak or speaks in the name of other gods that prophet must die
21  however you may say in your heart how will we know that jehovah has not spoken the word
22  when the prophet speaks in the name of jehovah and the word is not fulfilled or does not come true then jehovah did not speak that word
the prophet spoke it presumptuously
you should not fear him
17  you must not sacrifice to jehovah your god a bull or a sheep that has a defect or anything wrong with it for it would be detestable to jehovah your god
2  suppose a man or a woman is found among you in any of your cities that jehovah your god is giving you who is practicing what is bad in the eyes of jehovah your god and violating his covenant
3  and he goes astray and worships other gods and he bows down to them or to the sun or the moon or all the army of the heavens a thing that i have not commanded
4  when it is reported to you or you hear about it then you should investigate the matter thoroughly
if it is confirmed to be true that this detestable thing has been done in israel
5  you must bring the man or the woman who has done this evil thing out to the city gates and the man or the woman must be stoned to death
6  on the testimony of two witnesses or of three witnesses the one who is to die should be put to death
he must not be put to death on the testimony of one witness
7  the hand of the witnesses should be the first to come against him to put him to death and the hand of all the people afterward
you must remove what is bad from your midst
8  if a case arises in one of your cities that is too difficult for you to judge whether it is a case involving bloodshed or a legal claim that has been raised or a violent deed that has been committed or other matters of dispute you should rise up and go to the place that jehovah your god chooses
9  go to the levitical priests and to the judge serving in those days and make your inquiry and they will hand down the decision to you
10  then you must act according to the decision that they hand down to you from the place that jehovah chooses
be careful to do according to all that they instruct you
11  you must act according to the law that they show you and according to the decision that they declare to you
do not deviate from the decision that they will hand down to you either to the right or to the left
12  the man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who is ministering to jehovah your god or to the judge must die
you must remove what is bad from israel
13  all the people will then hear and become afraid and they will not act presumptuously anymore
14  when you enter the land that jehovah your god is giving you and you have taken possession of it and are living in it and you say let me appoint a king over myself like all the nations around me
15  in that case you should without fail appoint a king whom jehovah your god chooses
you should appoint a king from among your brothers
you are forbidden to appoint over yourself a foreigner who is not your brother
16  however he should not acquire many horses for himself or make the people go back to egypt in order to obtain more horses since jehovah told you you must never go back again by this way
17  neither should he take many wives for himself so that his heart may not go astray nor should he acquire vast amounts of silver and gold for himself
18  when he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom he must write for himself in a book a copy of this law taken from the one kept by the levitical priests
19  it is to remain with him and he must read from it all the days of his life so that he may learn to fear jehovah his god and observe all the words of this law and these regulations by carrying them out
20  thus his heart will not exalt itself above his brothers and he will not deviate from the commandment either to the right or to the left so that he may remain a long time over his kingdom he and his sons in the midst of israel
9  hear o israel today you are crossing the jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and mightier than you cities great and fortified to the heavens
2  a people great and tall the sons of the anʹakim about whom you know and have heard it said who can stand up to the sons of aʹnak
3  therefore you should know this day that jehovah your god will cross ahead of you
he is a consuming fire and he will annihilate them
he will subdue them before your eyes so that you may quickly drive them out and destroy them just as jehovah has promised you
4  do not say in your heart when jehovah your god drives them away from before you it was because of my own righteousness that jehovah has brought me in to take possession of this land
rather it is because of the wickedness of these nations that jehovah is driving them away from before you
5  it is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to take possession of their land
instead it is because of the wickedness of these nations that jehovah your god is driving them away from before you and in order to carry out the word that jehovah swore to your forefathers abraham isaac and jacob
6  know then that it is not because of your righteousness that jehovah your god is giving you this good land to take possession of because you are an obstinate people
7  remembernever forgetthe way you provoked jehovah your god in the wilderness
from the day that you left the land of egypt until your coming to this place you have rebelled against jehovah
8  even in hoʹreb you provoked jehovah and jehovah was so angry with you that he was ready to annihilate you
9  when i went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets the tablets of the covenant that jehovah made with you i remained on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights eating no food and drinking no water
10  then jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone written on with gods finger and on them were all the words that jehovah had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire in the day of the assembly
11  at the end of the 40 days and 40 nights jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone the tablets of the covenant
12  and jehovah told me get up go down quickly from here because your people whom you brought out of egypt have acted corruptly
they have quickly turned aside from the path i commanded them to follow
they have made a metal image for themselves
13  jehovah then said to me i have seen this people and look it is an obstinate people
14  let me be and i will annihilate them and wipe out their name from under the heavens and let me make you a nation mightier and more numerous than they are
15  then i turned and went down the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire and the two tablets of the covenant were in both my hands
16  then i looked and saw that you had sinned against jehovah your god you had made a metal calf for yourselves
you had turned aside quickly from the path jehovah had commanded you to follow
17  so i took hold of the two tablets and threw them down with both my hands and shattered them before your eyes
18  then i prostrated myself before jehovah as at first for 40 days and 40 nights
i neither ate food nor drank water because of all the sins that you had committed by your doing what was evil in jehovahs eyes and offending him
19  for i was terrified because of jehovahs great anger against you in that he was ready to annihilate you
however jehovah listened to me that time also
20  jehovah was so angry with aaron that he was ready to annihilate him but i made supplication for aaron at that time also
21  then i took the sinful thing you made the calf and burned it up in the fire i crushed it and ground it thoroughly until it was fine like dust and i threw the dust into the stream that flows down from the mountain
22  further at tabʹerah at masʹsah and at kibʹrothhattaʹavah you also provoked jehovah to anger
23  when jehovah sent you out of kaʹdeshbarʹnea and said go up and take possession of the land that i will certainly give you you again rebelled against the order of jehovah your god and you did not exercise faith in him and did not obey him
24  you have rebelled against jehovah ever since i have known you
25  so i kept prostrating myself before jehovah 40 days and 40 nights for i prostrated myself in this way because jehovah said he would annihilate you
26  i began to make supplication to jehovah and to say o sovereign lord jehovah do not bring your people to ruin
they are your personal possession whom you redeemed through your greatness and brought out of egypt with a mighty hand
27  remember your servants abraham isaac and jacob
do not pay attention to the stubbornness of this people their wickedness and their sin
28  otherwise the people of the land from which you brought us may say jehovah was unable to bring them into the land that he promised them and because he hated them he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness
29  for they are your people and your personal possession whom you brought out with your great power and your outstretched arm
28  and if you will without fail listen to the voice of jehovah your god by being careful to do all his commandments that i am commanding you today jehovah your god will certainly put you high above all other nations of the earth
2  all these blessings will come upon you and overtake you because you keep listening to the voice of jehovah your god
3  blessed you will be in the city and blessed you will be in the field
4  blessed will be your children and the fruit of your ground and the offspring of your livestock your young cattle and sheep
5  blessed will be your basket and your kneading bowl
6  blessed you will be when you come in and blessed you will be when you go out
7  jehovah will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you
they will attack you from one direction but they will flee from you in seven different directions
8  jehovah will decree for you a blessing on your storehouses and every undertaking of yours and he will certainly bless you in the land that jehovah your god is giving you
9  jehovah will establish you as a holy people to himself just as he swore to you because you continue to keep the commandments of jehovah your god and walk in his ways
10  all the peoples of the earth will have to see that jehovahs name has been called upon you and they will be afraid of you
11  jehovah will make you overflow with many children and much livestock and fruitful ground in the land that jehovah swore to your forefathers to give you
12  jehovah will open up to you his good storehouse the heavens to give your land rain in its season and to bless all that you do
you will lend to many nations while you yourself will not need to borrow
13  jehovah will make you the head and not the tail and you will be on top and not on the bottom if you keep obeying the commandments of jehovah your god that i am commanding you today to observe and to do
14  you must not deviate from all the words that i am commanding you today to the right or to the left to walk after other gods to serve them
15  but if you will not listen to the voice of jehovah your god by taking care to do all his commandments and his statutes that i am commanding you today all these curses will come upon you and overtake you
16  cursed you will be in the city and cursed you will be in the field
17  cursed will be your basket and your kneading bowl
18  cursed will be your children and the fruit of your ground and your young cattle and sheep
19  cursed you will be when you come in and cursed you will be when you go out
20  jehovah will send upon you the curse confusion and punishment in every undertaking of yours until you have been annihilated and have quickly perished because of your bad practices and your forsaking me
21  jehovah will cause the disease to cling to you until he has exterminated you from the land you are going to take possession of
22  jehovah will strike you with tuberculosis burning fever inflammation feverish heat the sword scorching blight and mildew and they will pursue you until you have perished
23  the skies over your head will be copper and the earth beneath you iron
24  jehovah will make the rain of your land powder and dust that will come down on you from the heavens until you have been annihilated
25  jehovah will cause you to be defeated before your enemies
you will attack them from one direction but you will flee from them in seven different directions and you will become an object of horror to all the earths kingdoms
26  and your carcasses will become food for every bird of the sky and animal of the ground with no one to frighten them away
27  jehovah will strike you with the boils of egypt piles eczema and skin lesions from which you cannot be healed
28  jehovah will strike you with madness and blindness and confusion
29  you will grope about at midday just as a blind man gropes about in darkness and you will not succeed in anything you do and you will be constantly defrauded and robbed with no one to save you
30  you will become engaged to a woman but another man will rape her
you will build a house but you will not live in it
you will plant a vineyard but you will not begin to use it
31  your bull will be slaughtered before your eyes but you will not eat any of it
your donkey will be stolen right in front of you but it will not return to you
your sheep will be given to your enemies but you will have no savior
32  your sons and your daughters will be given to another people while you look on and you will always long for them but your hands will be powerless
33  the fruitage of your ground and all that you produce will be eaten by a people whom you have not known and you will always be defrauded and crushed
34  you will be driven mad by what your eyes see
35  jehovah will strike you with painful and incurable boils on your knees and legs from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head
36  jehovah will drive you and the king whom you set up over yourself to a nation that you and your forefathers have not known and there you will serve other gods gods of wood and of stone
37  and you will become an object of horror and of scorn and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples to whom jehovah drives you
38  you will take much seed out into the field but you will gather little because the locust will devour it
39  vineyards you will plant and cultivate but you will drink no wine and gather nothing because the worm will consume it
40  you will have olive trees in all your territory but you will rub no oil on yourself because your olives will drop off
41  sons and daughters you will bear but they will not remain yours because they will go off into captivity
42  swarms of insects will overwhelm all your trees and the fruitage of your ground
43  the foreign resident who is in your midst will keep ascending higher and higher over you while you yourself will keep descending lower and lower
44  he will lend to you but you will not lend to him
he will become the head while you yourself will become the tail
45  all these curses will certainly come upon you and pursue you and overtake you until you have been annihilated because you did not listen to the voice of jehovah your god by keeping his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you
46  and they will continue on you and your offspring as a permanent sign and portent
47  because you did not serve jehovah your god with rejoicing and joy of heart when you had such an abundance of everything
48  jehovah will send your enemies against you and you will serve them while you are hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and lacking everything
he will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has annihilated you
49  jehovah will raise up against you a distant nation from the end of the earth it will pounce like an eagle a nation whose language you will not understand
50  a nation fierce in appearance that will show no regard to the old or favor to the young
51  they will eat the offspring of your livestock and the fruitage of your ground until you have been annihilated
they will not leave any grain new wine or oil young cattle or sheep for you until they have destroyed you
52  they will besiege you shutting you up inside all your cities throughout your land until your high and fortified walls that you are trusting in fall down
yes they will certainly besiege you within all your cities throughout your land that jehovah your god has given you
53  then you will have to eat your own children the flesh of your sons and your daughters whom jehovah your god has given you because of the severity of the siege and the distress your enemy inflicts on you
54  even the most delicate and sensitive man among you will have no pity on his brother or his cherished wife or his sons who remain
55  and he will not share with them any of the flesh of his sons that he will eat because he has nothing else on account of the severity of the siege and the distress your enemy inflicts on your cities
56  and the delicate and sensitive woman among you who would not even think of putting the sole of her foot on the ground because she is so delicate will show no pity to her cherished husband or her son or her daughter
57  even toward the afterbirth that comes from between her legs and toward the sons she bears for she will secretly eat them because of the severity of the siege and the distress your enemy inflicts on your cities
58  if you will not carefully observe all the words of this law that are written in this book and you do not fear this glorious and aweinspiring name that of jehovah your god
59  jehovah will inflict very severe plagues on you and your offspring great and enduring plagues and grievous and enduring sicknesses
60  he will bring back upon you all the diseases of egypt that you used to fear and they will certainly cling to you
61  moreover jehovah will even bring upon you every sickness or plague not written in the book of this law until you have been annihilated
62  although you have become as numerous as the stars of the heavens very few of your number will be left because you did not listen to the voice of jehovah your god
63  and just as jehovah once delighted to make you prosper and to multiply you so jehovah will delight to destroy you and to annihilate you and you will be torn from the land you are about to possess
64  jehovah will scatter you among all the nations from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth and there you will have to serve gods of wood and of stone which you and your forefathers have not known
65  you will have no peace among those nations nor a place of rest for the sole of your foot
rather jehovah will give you there an anxious heart and failing eyes and a feeling of despair
66  your life will be in great peril and you will feel dread night and day and you will be uncertain of your survival
67  in the morning you will say if only it were evening and in the evening you will say if only it were morning because of the dread you will feel in your heart and because of what your eyes will see
68  and jehovah will certainly bring you back to egypt by ship by the way that i told you you will never see it again and there you will have to sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves but there will be no buyer
27  then moses together with the elders of israel commanded the people saying observe every commandment that i am giving you today
2  and in the day when you will cross the jordan into the land that jehovah your god is giving you set up large stones and cover them with plaster
3  then write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over so that you may enter into the land that jehovah your god is giving you a land flowing with milk and honey just as jehovah the god of your forefathers has promised you
4  when you have crossed the jordan you should set up these stones on mount eʹbal and cover them with plaster just as i am commanding you today
5  you are also to build an altar there to jehovah your god an altar of stones
you should not use iron tools on them
6  you should build the altar of jehovah your god with whole stones and offer burnt offerings to jehovah your god on it
7  you are to offer communion sacrifices and eat them there and you will rejoice before jehovah your god
8  and clearly write on the stones all the words of this law
9  then moses and the levitical priests spoke to all israel saying keep silent and listen o israel
this day you have become the people of jehovah your god
10  you must listen to the voice of jehovah your god and carry out his commandments and his regulations which i am commanding you today
11  on that day moses commanded the people saying
12  the following tribes will stand on mount gerʹizim to bless the people when you have crossed the jordan simʹeon leʹvi judah isʹsachar joseph and benjamin
13  and the following will stand on mount eʹbal to pronounce the curse reuʹben gad ashʹer zebʹulun dan and naphʹtali
14  and the levites will answer every man of israel with a loud voice
15  cursed is the man who makes a carved image or a metal statue a thing detestable to jehovah the workmanship of the hands of a craftsman and who has hidden it
and all the people will respond saying amen
16  cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt
and all the people will say amen
17  cursed is the one who moves his neighbors boundary marker
and all the people will say amen
18  cursed is the one who causes a blind person to lose his way on the road
and all the people will say amen
19  cursed is the one who perverts the judgment of a foreign resident a fatherless child or a widow
and all the people will say amen
20  cursed is the one who lies down with his fathers wife for he has dishonored his father
and all the people will say amen
21  cursed is the one who lies down with any animal
and all the people will say amen
22  cursed is the one who lies down with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother
and all the people will say amen
23  cursed is the one who lies down with his motherinlaw
and all the people will say amen
24  cursed is the one who ambushes and kills his neighbor
and all the people will say amen
25  cursed is the one who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person
and all the people will say amen
26  cursed is the one who will not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out
and all the people will say amen
7  when jehovah your god brings you into the land you are about to enter and take possession of he will also clear away populous nations from before you the hitʹtites the girʹgashites the amʹorites the caʹnaanites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites seven nations more populous and mightier than you are
2  jehovah your god will give them over to you and you will defeat them
you should without fail devote them to destruction
you must not make any covenant with them nor show them any favor
3  you must not form any marriage alliances with them
do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons
4  for they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods then jehovahs anger will blaze against you and he will swiftly annihilate you
5  instead this is what you should do to them tear down their altars break up their sacred pillars cut down their sacred poles and burn up their graven images
6  for you are a holy people to jehovah your god and jehovah your god has chosen you to become his people his special property out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth
7  it was not because you were the most numerous of all the peoples that jehovah showed affection for you and chose you for you were the smallest of all the peoples
8  rather it was because of jehovahs love for you and because he kept the oath that he had sworn to your forefathers that jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand to redeem you from the house of slavery from the power of pharʹaoh king of egypt
9  you well know that jehovah your god is the true god the faithful god keeping his covenant and loyal love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments
10  but those who hate him he will repay to their face with destruction
he will not be slow to deal with those who hate him he will repay them to their face
11  therefore take care to keep the commandments and the regulations and the judicial decisions that i am commanding you today by observing them
12  if you continue listening to these judicial decisions and you observe them and carry them out jehovah your god will keep the covenant and the loyal love about which he swore to your forefathers
13  he will love you and bless you and multiply you
yes he will bless you with many children and with the produce of your soil your grain your new wine your oil the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land that he swore to your forefathers to give to you
14  you will become the most blessed of all the peoples no man or woman among you will be childless nor will your livestock be without young
15  jehovah will take away from you all sickness and he will not bring upon you any of the terrible diseases that you have known in egypt
instead he will bring them upon all those who hate you
16  you are to destroy all the peoples whom jehovah your god gives over to you
you must not feel sorry for them and you must not serve their gods because that would be a snare to you
17  if you should say in your heart these nations outnumber us
how can i drive them away
18  you must not be afraid of them
you should remind yourself of what jehovah your god did to pharʹaoh and all egypt
19  the great judgments that your eyes saw and the signs and the miracles and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm with which jehovah your god brought you out
that is what jehovah your god will do to all the peoples you fear
20  jehovah your god will send the feeling of dejection upon them until those who were left remaining and who were concealing themselves from before you perish
21  do not be struck with terror because of them for jehovah your god is with you a great and aweinspiring god
22  jehovah your god will certainly drive these nations away from before you little by little
you will not be allowed to put an end to them quickly so that the wild animals of the field will not multiply against you
23  jehovah your god will give them over to you and utterly defeat them until they are annihilated
24  he will give their kings into your hand and you will wipe out their names from under the heavens
nobody will stand up to you until you have exterminated them
25  you should burn the graven images of their gods in the fire
do not desire the silver and the gold on them or take it for yourself so that you are not ensnared by it for it is something detestable to jehovah your god
26  you must not bring a detestable thing into your house and thereby become something devoted to destruction like it
you should utterly loathe it and absolutely detest it because it is something devoted to destruction
34  then moses went up from the desert plains of moʹab to mount neʹbo to the top of pisʹgah which faces jerʹicho
and jehovah showed him all the land from gilʹead to dan
2  and all naphʹtali and the land of eʹphraim and manasʹseh and all the land of judah as far as the western sea
3  and the negʹeb and the district the valley plain of jerʹicho the city of the palm trees as far as zoʹar
4  jehovah then said to him this is the land about which i have sworn to abraham isaac and jacob saying to your offspring i will give it
i have let you see it with your own eyes but you will not cross over there
5  after that moses the servant of jehovah died there in the land of moʹab just as jehovah had said
6  he buried him in the valley in the land of moʹab opposite bethpeʹor and nobody knows where his grave is down to this day
7  moses was 120 years old at his death
his eyes had not grown dim and his strength had not departed
8  the people of israel wept for moses on the desert plains of moʹab for 30 days
then the days of weeping and mourning for moses were completed
9  joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had laid his hand on him and the israelites began to listen to him and they did just as jehovah had commanded moses
10  but there has never again arisen a prophet in israel like moses whom jehovah knew facetoface
11  he performed all the signs and the miracles that jehovah had sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharʹaoh and all his servants and all his land
12  along with the mighty hand and the awesome power that moses displayed before the eyes of all israel
23  no man who has been castrated by having his testicles crushed or who has had his male organ cut off may come into the congregation of jehovah
2  no illegitimate son may come into the congregation of jehovah
even to the tenth generation none of his descendants may come into the congregation of jehovah
3  no amʹmonite or moʹabite may come into the congregation of jehovah
even to the tenth generation none of their descendants may ever come into the congregation of jehovah
4  because they did not come to your aid with food and water when you were on the way going out of egypt and because they hired against you baʹlaam the son of beʹor from peʹthor of mesopotaʹmia to curse you
5  but jehovah your god refused to listen to baʹlaam
rather jehovah your god changed the curse into a blessing for you because jehovah your god loved you
6  you should never seek their welfare or their prosperity all your days
7  you must not hate an eʹdomite for he is your brother
you must not hate an egyptian for you became a foreign resident in his country
8  the third generation of children born to them may enter the congregation of jehovah
9  when you are encamped against your enemies you should avoid anything bad
10  if a man becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission he should go outside the camp and not reenter the camp
11  when evening falls he should wash with water and then he may return to the camp at sunset
12  a private place should be designated for use outside the camp and there is where you should go
13  a peg should be part of your equipment
when you squat outside you should dig a hole with it and then cover your excrement
14  for jehovah your god is walking about within your camp to deliver you and to hand over your enemies to you and your camp must be holy so that he does not see anything indecent in you and turn away from accompanying you
15  you should not hand over a slave to his master when he escapes from his master and comes to you
16  he may dwell among you in whatever place he chooses in one of your cities wherever he likes
you must not mistreat him
17  none of the daughters of israel may become a temple prostitute neither may anyone of the sons of israel become a temple prostitute
18  you must not bring the price paid to a female prostitute or the price paid to a male prostitute into the house of jehovah your god to fulfill a vow for both of them are something detestable to jehovah your god
19  you must not make your brother pay interest whether interest on money on food or on anything on which interest may be charged
20  you may make a foreigner pay interest but you must not make your brother pay interest so that jehovah your god may bless you in every undertaking of yours in the land you are going to take possession of
21  if you make a vow to jehovah your god do not be slow about paying it
for jehovah your god will surely require it of you otherwise it will be a sin on your part
22  but if you refrain from making a vow you will not be guilty of sin
23  the word of your lips you should keep and you must carry out what your own mouth vowed as a voluntary offering to jehovah your god
24  if you enter your neighbors vineyard you may eat enough grapes to satisfy your appetite but you should not put any in your container
25  if you go into your neighbors field of standing grain you may pluck the ripe ears with your hand but you should not put a sickle to your neighbors grain
22  if you see your brothers bull or his sheep going astray do not deliberately ignore it
you should without fail lead it back to your brother
2  but if your brother does not live near you or you do not know him you should bring the animal to your house and it will remain with you until your brother searches for it
then you should return it to him
3  that is what you should do with his donkey with his clothing and with anything that your brother has lost and you have found
you must not ignore it
4  if you see your brothers donkey or his bull fall down on the road you must not deliberately ignore it
you should without fail help him raise the animal up
5  a woman must not put on the clothing of a man nor should a man wear the clothing of a woman
for anyone doing so is detestable to jehovah your god
6  if you happen upon a birds nest along the road with young ones or eggs whether in a tree or on the ground and the mother is sitting on the young ones or the eggs you must not take the mother together with her young
7  be sure to send the mother away but you may take the young for yourself
do this so that it may go well with you and you may live long
8  if you build a new house you must also make a parapet for your roof so that you may not bring bloodguilt on your house because of someone falling from it
9  you must not sow your vineyard with two sorts of seed
otherwise everything produced from the seed you sow as well as the product of the vineyard will be forfeited to the sanctuary
10  you must not plow with a bull and a donkey together
11  you must not wear clothing made of wool and linen mixed together
12  you should make tassels on the four corners of the clothing you wear
13  if a man takes a wife and has relations with her but then comes to hate her
14  and he accuses her of misconduct and gives her a bad name by saying i have taken this woman but when i had relations with her i did not find evidence that she was a virgin
15  the father and mother of the girl should produce the evidence of the girls virginity for the elders at the gate of the city
16  the girls father must say to the elders i gave my daughter to this man as a wife but he hates her
17  and is accusing her of misconduct by saying i have found out that your daughter does not have evidence of virginity
now this is the evidence of my daughters virginity
they will then spread out the cloth before the elders of the city
18  the city elders will take the man and discipline him
19  they will fine him 100 silver shekels and give them to the girls father because the man defamed a virgin of israel and she will continue to be his wife
he will not be allowed to divorce her as long as he lives
20  if though the accusation is true and there is no evidence that the girl was a virgin
21  they should bring the girl out to the entrance of her fathers house and the men of her city should stone her to death because she has committed a disgraceful act in israel by committing sexual immorality in the house of her father
so you must remove what is bad from your midst
22  if a man is found lying down with a woman who is the wife of another man both of them must die together the man who lay down with the woman as well as the woman
so you must remove what is bad out of israel
23  if a virgin is engaged to a man and another man happens to meet her in the city and lies down with her
24  you should bring them both out to the gate of that city and stone them to death the girl because she did not scream in the city and the man because he humiliated the wife of his fellow man
so you must remove what is evil from your midst
25  if however the man happened to meet the engaged girl in the field and the man overpowered her and lay down with her the man who lay down with her is to die by himself
26  and you must do nothing to the girl
the girl has not committed a sin deserving of death
this case is the same as when a man attacks his fellow man and murders him
27  for he happened to meet her in the field and the engaged girl screamed but there was no one to rescue her
28  if a man happens to meet a virgin girl who is not engaged and he seizes her and lies down with her and they are discovered
29  the man who lay down with her must give the girls father 50 silver shekels and she will become his wife
because he humiliated her he will not be allowed to divorce her as long as he lives
30  no man should take his fathers wife so that he may not dishonor his father
32  give ear o heavens and i will speakand let the earth hear the words of my mouth
2  my instruction will fall as the rainmy words will trickle as the dewas gentle rains upon grassand as copious showers upon vegetation
3  for i will declare the name of jehovah
tell about the greatness of our god
4  the rock perfect is his activityfor all his ways are justice
a god of faithfulness who is never unjustrighteous and upright is he
5  they are the ones who have acted corruptly
they are not his children the defect is their own
they are a crooked and twisted generation
6  is this the way that you should treat jehovaho foolish and unwise people is he not your father who caused your existencethe one who made you and firmly established you
7  remember the days of oldconsider the years of past generations
ask your father and he can tell youyour elders and they will inform you
8  when the most high gave the nations their inheritancewhen he divided the sons of adam from one anotherhe fixed the boundary of the peopleswith regard for the number of the sons of israel
9  for jehovahs people are his portionjacob is his inheritance
10  he found him in a wilderness landand in an empty howling desert
he protectively encircled him took care of himand safeguarded him as the pupil of his eye
11  just as an eagle stirs up its nesthovers over its fledglingsspreading out its wings taking themcarrying them on its pinions
12  jehovah alone kept leading himno foreign god was with him
13  he made him ride upon earths high placesso that he ate the produce of the field
he nourished him with honey from the cragand oil out of a flinty rock
14  butter of the herd and milk of the flocktogether with the choicest sheepand rams of baʹshan and hegoatstogether with the finest wheatand you drank wine from the blood of grapes
15  when jeshʹurun grew fat he kicked out rebelliously
you have grown fat you have become stout you have become bloated
so he forsook god who made himand despised the rock of his salvation
16  they incited him to fury with foreign godsthey were offending him with detestable things
17  they were sacrificing to demons not to godto gods that they had not knownnew ones that came along recentlyto gods that your forefathers did not know
18  you forgot the rock who fathered youand you did not remember the god who gave birth to you
19  when jehovah saw it he rejected thembecause his sons and his daughters offended him
20  so he said i will hide my face from themi will see what will become of them
for they are a perverse generationsons in whom there is no faithfulness
21  they have incited me to fury with what is not a godthey have offended me with their worthless idols
so i will incite them to jealousy with what is not a peoplei will offend them with a foolish nation
22  for my anger has kindled a firethat will burn to the depths of the graveand it will consume the earth and its produceand will set ablaze the foundations of mountains
23  i will increase their calamitiesi will use up my arrows on them
24  they will be exhausted from hungerand eaten up by burning fever and bitter destruction
i will send the teeth of beasts against themand the venom of reptiles of the dust
25  outside a sword will bereave theminside there is terrorfor both young man and virgininfant together with grayhaired man
26  i would have said i will scatter themi will make the memory of them cease from among men
27  if not for my dread of the enemys reactionbecause the adversaries might misconstrue it
they might say our power has triumphedit was not jehovah who did all of this
28  for they are a nation devoid of senseand there is no understanding among them
29  if only they were wise they would ponder over this
they would think about their outcome
30  how could one chase after 1000and two put 10000 to flight not unless their rock had sold themand jehovah had surrendered them
31  for their rock is not like our rockeven our enemies have understood this
32  for their vine is from the vine of sodʹomand from the terraces of gomorʹrah
their grapes are grapes of poisontheir clusters are bitter
33  their wine is the venom of serpentsthe cruel poison of cobras
34  is this not stored up with mesealed up in my storehouse
35  vengeance is mine and retributionat the appointed time when their foot slipsfor the day of their disaster is nearand what awaits them will come quickly
36  for jehovah will judge his peopleand he will feel pity for his servantswhen he sees that their strength has wanedand that only the helpless and weak remain
37  then he will say where are their godsthe rock in whom they sought refuge
38  who used to eat the fat of their sacrificesto drink the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you
let them become your place of refuge
39  see now that ii am heand there are no gods apart from me
i put to death and i make alive
i wound and i will healand no one can rescue from my hand
40  for i raise my hand to heavenand i swear as surely as i live forever
41  if i sharpen my flashing swordand prepare my hand for judgmenti will pay back vengeance on my adversariesand bring retribution to those who hate me
42  i will make my arrows drunk with bloodand my sword will eat fleshwith the blood of the slain and the captiveswith the heads of the leaders of the enemy
43  be glad you nations with his peoplefor he will avenge the blood of his servantsand he will repay vengeance to his adversariesand will make atonement for the land of his people
44  thus moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people he and hosheʹa the son of nun
45  after moses finished speaking all these words to all israel
46  he said to them take to heart all the words of my warning to you today so that you may command your sons to take care to do all the words of this law
47  for this is no empty word for you but it means your life and by this word you may live long in the land that you are crossing the jordan to possess
48  jehovah spoke to moses on this same day saying
49  go up into this mountain of abʹarim mount neʹbo which is in the land of moʹab which faces toward jerʹicho and view the land of caʹnaan which i am giving to the israelites as a possession
50  then you will die on the mountain you are about to ascend and be gathered to your people just as aaron your brother died on mount hor and was gathered to his people
51  because both of you were unfaithful to me among the israelites at the waters of merʹibah of kaʹdesh in the wilderness of zin because you did not sanctify me before the people of israel
52  you will see the land from a distance but you will not enter the land that i am giving to the people of israel
6  now these are the commandments the regulations and the judicial decisions that jehovah your god has given to teach you so that you may observe them when you cross over into the land that you are to take possession of
2  in order that you may fear jehovah your god and keep all his statutes and his commandments that i am commanding youyou and your son and your grandsonall the days of your life so that you may live a long time
3  and you must listen o israel and carefully observe them so that you may prosper and become very many in the land flowing with milk and honey just as jehovah the god of your forefathers has promised you
4  listen o israel jehovah our god is one jehovah
5  you must love jehovah your god with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength
6  these words that i am commanding you today must be on your heart
7  and you must inculcate them in your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up
8  tie them as a reminder on your hand and they must be like a headband on your forehead
9  write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates
10  when jehovah your god brings you into the land that he swore to your forefathers abraham isaac and jacob to give yougreat and fine cities that you did not build
11  houses full of all sorts of good things that you did not work for hewn cisterns that you did not dig and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plantand you have eaten and become satisfied
12  be careful not to forget jehovah who brought you out of the land of egypt out of the house of slavery
13  jehovah your god you should fear and him you should serve and by his name you should swear
14  you must not follow after other gods any gods of the peoples who are all around you
15  for jehovah your god who is in your midst is a god who requires exclusive devotion
otherwise the anger of jehovah your god will blaze against you and he will annihilate you from the face of the earth
16  you must not put jehovah your god to the test the way you put him to the test at masʹsah
17  you should diligently observe the commandments of jehovah your god and his reminders and his regulations that he has commanded you to observe
18  you must do what is right and good in jehovahs eyes in order that you may prosper and that you may enter and take possession of the good land about which jehovah has sworn to your forefathers
19  by driving out all your enemies from before you just as jehovah has promised
20  in the future when your son asks you what is the meaning of the reminders the regulations and the judicial decisions that jehovah our god has commanded you
21  then you will say to your son we became slaves to pharʹaoh in egypt but jehovah brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand
22  so before our eyes jehovah kept sending signs and miracles great and devastating upon egypt upon pharʹaoh and upon all his household
23  and he brought us out from there in order to bring us here to give us the land about which he had sworn to our forefathers
24  then jehovah commanded us to carry out all these regulations and to fear jehovah our god for our lasting good so that we could keep alive as we are today
25  and it will mean righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all these commandments in obedience to jehovah our god just as he has commanded us
31  then moses went out and spoke these words to all israel
2  saying to them i am 120 years old today
i can no longer lead you for jehovah has said to me you will not cross this jordan
3  jehovah your god is the one crossing before you and he himself will annihilate these nations before you and you will drive them away
joshua is the one who will lead you across just as jehovah has spoken
4  jehovah will do to them just as he did to siʹhon and to og the kings of the amʹorites and to their land when he annihilated them
5  jehovah will defeat them for you and you are to do to them according to the whole commandment that i have given you
6  be courageous and strong
do not be afraid or struck with terror before them for jehovah your god is the one marching with you
he will neither desert you nor abandon you
7  moses then called joshua and said to him before the eyes of all israel be courageous and strong for you are the one who will bring this people into the land that jehovah swore to their forefathers to give to them and you will give it to them as an inheritance
8  jehovah is the one marching before you and he will continue with you
he will neither desert you nor abandon you
do not be afraid or be terrified
9  then moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests the levites who carry the ark of jehovahs covenant and to all the elders of israel
10  moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years at the appointed time in the year of the release during the festival of booths
11  when all israel appears before the presence of jehovah your god in the place that he chooses you should read this law for all israel to hear it
12  gather the people together the men the women the children and your foreign resident who is within your cities in order that they may listen and learn about and fear jehovah your god and take care to carry out all the words of this law
13  then their sons who have not known this law will listen and learn to fear jehovah your god all the days that you live in the land that you are crossing the jordan to possess
14  jehovah then said to moses look the time has drawn near for you to die
call joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting so that i may commission him
so moses and joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting
15  then jehovah appeared at the tent in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of cloud stood by the entrance of the tent
16  jehovah now said to moses look you are about to die and this people will begin to commit spiritual prostitution with the foreign gods that are around them in the land to which they are going
they will forsake me and break my covenant that i have made with them
17  at that time my anger will blaze against them and i will forsake them and hide my face from them until they are devoured
then after many calamities and distresses have come upon them they will say is it not because our god is not in our midst that these calamities have come upon us
18  but i will keep my face hidden in that day because of all the wickedness that they have done in turning to other gods
19  now write down this song for yourselves and teach it to the israelites
have them learn it in order that this song may serve as my witness against the people of israel
20  when i bring them to the land that i have sworn about to their forefathersone flowing with milk and honeyand they eat their fill and prosper they will turn to other gods and serve them and treat me with disrespect and break my covenant
21  when many calamities and distresses come upon them this song will serve as a witness to them for their descendants should not forget it for i already know the inclination that they have developed even before i bring them into the land about which i have sworn
22  so moses wrote down this song in that day and taught it to the israelites
23  he then commissioned joshua the son of nun and said be courageous and strong for you are the one who will bring the israelites into the land about which i have sworn to them and i will continue with you
24  as soon as moses had completed writing the words of this law in a book in their entirety
25  moses commanded the levites who carry the ark of jehovahs covenant saying
26  take this book of the law and place it at the side of the ark of the covenant of jehovah your god and it will serve as a witness there against you
27  for i myself well know your rebelliousness and your stubbornness
if you have been so rebellious against jehovah while i am still alive with you then how much more so will you be after my death
28  gather together to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers and let me speak these words in their hearing and let me take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against them
29  for i well know that after my death you will surely act wickedly and turn aside from the way about which i have commanded you
and calamity will certainly befall you at the close of the days because you will do what is bad in the eyes of jehovah and you will offend him by the works of your hands
30  then in the hearing of the entire congregation of israel moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end
21  if someone is found slain in a field of the land that jehovah your god is giving you to possess and it is not known who killed him
2  your elders and judges should go out and measure the distance from the dead body to the cities that surround it
3  then the elders of the city nearest to the body should take from the herd a young cow that has never been put to work that has never pulled in a yoke
4  and the elders of that city should lead the young cow down to a valley running with water where no tilling or sowing of seed has been done and they should break the neck of the young cow there in the valley
5  and the priests the levites will approach because jehovah your god has chosen them to minister to him to pronounce blessings in the name of jehovah
they will declare how every dispute involving violence should be resolved
6  then all the elders of the city who are nearest to the dead body should wash their hands over the young cow whose neck was broken in the valley
7  and they should declare our hands did not shed this blood nor did our eyes see it shed
8  do not hold this against your people israel whom you redeemed o jehovah and do not let guilt for innocent blood remain among your people israel
then the bloodguilt will not be held against them
9  in this way you will remove the guilt of innocent blood from your midst by doing what is right in jehovahs eyes
10  if you go to war against your enemies and jehovah your god defeats them for you and you take them captive
11  and you see among the captives a beautiful woman and you are attracted to her and you want to take her as your wife
12  you may bring her into your house
she should then shave her head attend to her nails
13  and remove the clothing of her captivity and dwell in your house
she will weep for her father and her mother a whole month and afterward you may have relations with her you will become her husband and she will become your wife
14  but if you are not pleased with her you should then let her go wherever she wishes
but you may not sell her for money or treat her harshly since you have humiliated her
15  if a man has two wives and he loves one more than the other and both have borne sons to him and the firstborn son belongs to the unloved one
16  on the day that he gives his inheritance to his sons he will not be allowed to treat the son of the loved one as his firstborn at the expense of the son of the unloved one the firstborn
17  he should recognize as the firstborn the unloved ones son by giving him the double portion of everything he has for that one is the beginning of his procreative power
the right of the firstborns position belongs to him
18  if a man has a son who is stubborn and rebellious and he does not obey his father or his mother and they have tried to correct him but he refuses to listen to them
19  his father and his mother should take hold of him and bring him out to the elders at the gate of his city
20  and say to the elders of his city this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious and he refuses to obey us
he is a glutton and a drunkard
21  then all the men of his city must stone him to death
so you must remove what is bad from your midst and all israel will hear and become afraid
22  if a man commits a sin deserving the sentence of death and he has been put to death and you have hung him on a stake
23  his dead body should not remain all night on the stake
instead you should be sure to bury him on that day because the one hung up is something accursed of god and you should not defile your land that jehovah your god is giving you as an inheritance
25  when a dispute arises between men they may present themselves before the judges and they will judge them and pronounce the righteous one innocent and the wicked one guilty
2  if the wicked one deserves to be beaten the judge will have him lie down prostrate and he will be beaten in his presence
the number of strokes should correspond to the wickedness of his deed
3  he may beat him with up to 40 strokes but no more
if he would continue beating him with more strokes than this your brother would be disgraced before your eyes
4  you must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out grain
5  if brothers dwell together and one of them dies without having a son the wife of the dead one should not marry someone from outside the family
her brotherinlaw should go to her take her as his wife and perform brotherinlaw marriage with her
6  the firstborn whom she will bear will carry on the name of his dead brother so that his name may not be wiped out of israel
7  now if the man does not want to marry his brothers widow his brothers widow should then go to the elders at the city gate and say my husbands brother has refused to preserve his brothers name in israel
he has not consented to perform brotherinlaw marriage with me
8  the elders of his city must call him and speak to him
should he insist and say i do not want to marry her
9  then his brothers widow should approach him before the elders remove his sandal from his foot spit in his face and say that is what should be done to the man who will not build up his brothers household
10  after that his family name in israel will be known as the house of the one who had his sandal removed
11  if two men get into a fight with each other and the wife of the one intervenes to protect her husband from the one striking him and she reaches out her hand and grabs hold of him by his private parts
12  you must amputate her hand
you should not feel sorry
13  you must not have in your bag two different stone weights a large one and a small one
14  you must not have in your house two different measuring containers a large one and a small one
15  you should keep an accurate and honest weight and an accurate and honest measure so that you will live long in the land that jehovah your god is giving you
16  for every unjust person who does such things is detestable to jehovah your god
17  remember what amʹalek did to you on the way as you were coming out of egypt
18  how he met you along the way and attacked all those straggling behind you when you were exhausted and weary
he did not fear god
19  when jehovah your god has given you rest from all your enemies around you in the land that jehovah your god is giving you as an inheritance to possess you should wipe out the mention of amʹalek from under the heavens
you must not forget
13  in case a prophet or one who foretells by dreams arises in your midst and gives you a sign or a portent
2  and the sign or the portent about which he spoke to you comes true while he is saying let us walk after other gods gods that you have not known and let us serve them
3  you must not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer for jehovah your god is testing you to know whether you love jehovah your god with all your heart and all your soul
4  after jehovah your god you should walk him you should fear his commandments you should keep to his voice you should listen he is the one you should serve and to him you should hold fast
5  but that prophet or that dreamer should be put to death because he encouraged rebellion against jehovah your godwho brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you from the house of slaveryto turn you from the way in which jehovah your god has commanded you to walk
and you must remove what is evil from your midst
6  if your brother the son of your mother or your son or your daughter or your cherished wife or your closest companion should try to entice you in secrecy saying let us go and serve other gods gods that neither you nor your forefathers have known
7  from the gods of the peoples all around you whether near you or those far away from you from one end of the land to the other end of the land
8  you must not give in to him or listen to him nor should you show pity or feel compassion or protect him
9  instead you should kill him without fail
your hand should be the first to come upon him to put him to death and the hand of all the people afterward
10  and you must stone him to death because he has sought to turn you away from jehovah your god who has brought you out of the land of egypt out of the house of slavery
11  then all israel will hear and become afraid and they will never again do anything bad like this among you
12  in case you hear it said in one of your cities that jehovah your god is giving you to occupy
13  goodfornothing men have gone out among you to turn away the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods gods that you have not known
14  you should look into the matter making a thorough investigation and inquiry and if it is confirmed to be true that this detestable thing has been done among you
15  you should without fail strike down the inhabitants of that city with the sword
devote it and everything that is in it including its livestock to destruction by the sword
16  you should then collect all its spoil into the middle of its public square and burn the city with fire and its spoil will serve as a whole offering to jehovah your god
it will become a permanent heap of ruins
it should never be rebuilt
17  your hand should take nothing that was set apart for destruction so that jehovah may turn away from his burning anger and show you mercy and compassion and multiply you just as he has sworn to your forefathers
18  for you should obey jehovah your god by keeping all his commandments that i am commanding you today thus doing what is right in the eyes of jehovah your god
14  you are sons of jehovah your god
do not cut yourselves or shave your foreheads bald for a dead person
2  for you are a holy people to jehovah your god and jehovah has chosen you to become his people his special property out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth
3  you must not eat anything that is detestable
4  these are the animals that you may eat the bull the sheep the goat
5  the deer the gazelle the roebuck the wild goat the antelope the wild sheep and the mountain sheep
6  you may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided into two and that chews the cud
7  however you must not eat the following animals that chew the cud or that have split hooves the camel the hare and the rock badger because they chew the cud but do not have split hooves
they are unclean for you
8  also the pig because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud
it is unclean for you
you must not eat their flesh or touch their carcasses
9  of everything that is living in the waters you may eat these anything with fins and scales you may eat
10  but you must not eat anything that has no fins and scales
it is unclean for you
11  you may eat any clean bird
12  but you must not eat these the eagle the osprey the black vulture
13  the red kite the black kite every kind of glede
14  every kind of raven
15  the ostrich the owl the gull every kind of falcon
16  the little owl the longeared owl the swan
17  the pelican the vulture the cormorant
18  the stork every kind of heron the hoopoe and the bat
19  every winged swarming creature also is unclean for you
they should not be eaten
20  any clean flying creature you may eat
21  you must not eat any animal that was found dead
you may give it to the foreign resident who is inside your cities and he may eat it or it may be sold to a foreigner
for you are a holy people to jehovah your god
you must not boil a young goat in its mothers milk
22  you must without fail give a tenth of everything your seed produces in the field year by year
23  you will eat the tenth part of your grain your new wine your oil and the firstborn of your herd and your flock before jehovah your god in the place that he chooses to have his name reside so that you may learn to fear jehovah your god always
24  but if the journey should be too long for you and you are not able to carry it to the place that jehovah your god chooses as the place for his name because it is far away from you because jehovah your god will bless you
25  you may then convert it into money and with your money in hand travel to the place that jehovah your god will choose
26  you may then spend the money on whatever you desirecattle sheep goats wine and other alcoholic beverages and anything you please and you will eat there before jehovah your god and rejoice you and your household
27  and do not neglect the levite who is inside your cities for he has no share or inheritance with you
28  at the end of every three years you should bring out the entire tenth part of your produce for that year and deposit it inside your cities
29  then the levite who has no share or inheritance with you the foreign resident the fatherless child and the widow who are in your cities will come and eat their fill so that jehovah your god may bless you in all that you do
29  these are the words of the covenant that jehovah commanded moses to make with the people of israel in the land of moʹab in addition to the covenant that he made with them at hoʹreb
2  moses then called together all israel and said to them you have seen all that jehovah did before your eyes in the land of egypt to pharʹaoh and all his servants and all his land
3  the great judgments that your eyes saw those great signs and miracles
4  but jehovah has not given you a heart to understand and eyes to see and ears to hear down to this day
5  while i kept guiding you for 40 years in the wilderness your garments did not wear out on you and your sandals did not wear out on your feet
6  you did not eat bread and you did not drink wine or anything alcoholic so that you would know that i am jehovah your god
7  you eventually came to this place and siʹhon the king of heshʹbon and og the king of baʹshan came out to meet us in battle but we defeated them
8  after that we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of the manasʹsites
9  therefore observe the words of this covenant and obey them so that everything you do will turn out well
10  all of you are stationed today before jehovah your god the heads of your tribes your elders your officers every man of israel
11  your children your wives and your foreign resident who is in the midst of your camp from the one gathering your wood to the one drawing your water
12  you are here in order to enter into the covenant of jehovah your god and his oath which jehovah your god is making with you today
13  in order that he may establish you today as his people and that he may be your god just as he has promised you and just as he swore to your forefathers abraham isaac and jacob
14  now it is not with you alone that i am making this covenant and this oath
15  but it is with those standing here with us today before jehovah our god and with those who are not here with us today
16  for you well know how we lived in the land of egypt and how we passed through the midst of various nations on our journey
17  and you used to see their detestable things and their disgusting idols of wood and stone silver and gold that were among them
18  beware that there may not be a man or a woman a family or a tribe among you today whose heart turns away from jehovah our god to go serve the gods of those nations that there may not be a root among you producing poisonous fruit and wormwood
19  but if someone hears the words of this oath and boasts in his heart saying i will have peace though i insist on walking in the ways of my own heart to the ruin of everything in his path
20  jehovah will not be willing to forgive him
instead jehovahs great anger will blaze against that man and the entire curse written in this book will certainly come upon him and jehovah will indeed wipe out his name from under the heavens
21  jehovah will then single him out from all the tribes of israel for calamity in accord with the entire curse of the covenant that is written in this book of the law
22  when the future generation of your sons and the foreigner from a distant land see the plagues of the land the maladies that jehovah has brought upon it
23  sulfur and salt and burning so that its whole land will not be sown or sprout nor will any vegetation spring up in it like the overthrow of sodʹom and gomorʹrah adʹmah and zeboiʹim which jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath
24  they and all the nations will say why did jehovah do this to this land what caused this great burning anger
25  then they will say it was because they abandoned the covenant of jehovah the god of their forefathers which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of egypt
26  but they went and served other gods and bowed down to them gods that they had not known and that he had not permitted them to worship
27  then jehovahs burning anger came against that land by bringing upon it the entire curse written in this book
28  therefore jehovah uprooted them from their soil in his anger and fury and great indignation and deported them to another land where they are today
29  the things concealed belong to jehovah our god but the things revealed belong to us and to our descendants forever so that we may carry out all the words of this law
19  when jehovah your god destroys the nations whose land jehovah your god is giving you and you have dispossessed them and have settled in their cities and their houses
2  you should set apart three cities in the midst of your land that jehovah your god is giving you to possess
3  you should divide the territory of the land that jehovah your god has given you to possess into three parts and prepare the roads so that any manslayer can flee to one of those cities
4  now this is what should take place regarding the manslayer who may flee there in order to live when he strikes his fellow man unintentionally and he did not previously hate him
5  as when he goes with his fellow man into the forest to gather wood and he raises his hand to cut the tree with the ax but the axhead flies off the handle and hits his fellow man and he dies the manslayer should flee to one of these cities to live
6  otherwise in the heat of anger the avenger of blood may chase after the manslayer overtake him and kill him because the distance to the city was too far
however he did not deserve to die since he did not previously hate his fellow man
7  that is why i am commanding you set three cities apart
8  if jehovah your god enlarges your territory as he swore to your forefathers and he has given you all the land that he promised to give to your forefathers
9  provided you faithfully observe all this commandment that i am giving you today to love jehovah your god and always to walk in his waysthen you are to add three other cities to these three
10  in this way no innocent blood will be spilled in your land that jehovah your god is giving you as an inheritance and no bloodguilt will come upon you
11  but if a man hated his fellow man and he was waiting to attack him and he fatally wounded him and he died and the man has fled to one of these cities
12  the elders of his city should then summon him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood and he must die
13  you should not feel sorry for him and you must remove the guilt of innocent blood out of israel so that it may go well for you
14  when you receive your inheritance in the land that jehovah your god is giving you to possess you must not move your neighbors boundary marker from the place where the ancestors set the boundaries
15  no single witness may convict another for any error or any sin that he may commit
on the testimony of two witnesses or on the testimony of three witnesses the matter should be established
16  if a malicious witness testifies against a man and charges him with some transgression
17  the two men who have the dispute will stand before jehovah before the priests and the judges who will be serving in those days
18  the judges will thoroughly investigate and if the man who testified is a false witness and has brought a false charge against his brother
19  you should do to him just as he had schemed to do to his brother and you must remove what is bad from your midst
20  those who remain will hear and be afraid and they will never again do anything bad like this among you
21  you should not feel sorry life will be for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
24  if a man marries a woman but she does not please him because he found something indecent about her he must write out a certificate of divorce for her hand it to her and dismiss her from his house
2  after she leaves his house she may go and become another mans wife
3  if the second man hates her and writes out a certificate of divorce for her hands it to her and dismisses her from his house or if the second man who married her should die
4  her first husband who dismissed her will not be allowed to take her back again as his wife after she has been defiled for that is something detestable to jehovah
you must not bring sin into the land that jehovah your god is giving you as an inheritance
5  when a man is newly married he should not serve in the army or be given any other duties
he should remain exempt for one year and stay at home and bring joy to his wife
6  no one should seize a hand mill or its upper millstone as security for a loan for that would be taking someones livelihood as security
7  if someone is found to have kidnapped one of his israelite brothers and he has mistreated him and sold him the kidnapper must die
you should remove what is bad from your midst
8  when there is an outbreak of leprosy be very careful to do according to all that the levitical priests will instruct you
be careful to do exactly as i commanded them
9  remember what jehovah your god did to mirʹiam on the way when you were coming out of egypt
10  if you make any sort of loan to your neighbor you must not enter into his house to seize from him what he has offered as security
11  you should stand outside and the man who received the loan should bring outside to you what he is giving as security
12  and if the man is in need you must not go to bed with what he gave as security still in your possession
13  you should by all means return to him what he has given as security as soon as the sun sets and he will go to bed with his garment and he will bless you and it will mean righteousness for you before jehovah your god
14  you must not defraud a hired worker who is in need and poor whether one of your brothers or a foreign resident in your land within your cities
15  you should give him his wages that very day before the sun sets because he is in need and his life depends on his wages
otherwise he will cry out to jehovah against you and you will be guilty of sin
16  fathers should not be put to death for what their children do and children should not be put to death for what their fathers do
a person should be put to death only for his own sin
17  you must not pervert the judgment of the foreign resident or of the fatherless child and you must not seize the garment of a widow as security for a loan
18  remember that you became a slave in egypt and jehovah your god redeemed you from there
that is why i am commanding you to do this
19  when you reap your harvest from your field and you have forgotten a sheaf in the field do not go back to get it
it should be left for the foreign resident the fatherless child and the widow so that jehovah your god may bless you in all that you do
20  when you beat your olive tree you should not repeat the procedure on its branches
what is left should remain for the foreign resident the fatherless child and the widow
21  when you gather the grapes of your vineyard you must not return to gather the leftovers
they should be left for the foreign resident the fatherless child and the widow
22  remember that you became a slave in the land of egypt
that is why i am commanding you to do this
5  moses then summoned all israel and said to them hear o israel the regulations and the judicial decisions that i am announcing to you today and you must learn them and carefully observe them
2  jehovah our god made a covenant with us in hoʹreb
3  it was not with our forefathers that jehovah made this covenant but with us all of us alive here today
4  jehovah spoke facetoface with you in the mountain out of the fire
5  i was standing between jehovah and you at that time to convey to you the word of jehovah for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain
he said
6  i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt out of the house of slavery
7  you must never have any other gods besides me
8  you must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth
9  you must not bow down to them nor be led to serve them for i jehovah your god am a god who requires exclusive devotion bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me
10  but showing loyal love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments
11  you must not take up the name of jehovah your god in a worthless way for jehovah will not leave anyone unpunished who takes up his name in a worthless way
12  observe the sabbath day to keep it sacred just as jehovah your god commanded you
13  you are to labor and do all your work in six days
14  but the seventh day is a sabbath to jehovah your god
you must not do any work neither you nor your son nor your daughter nor your slave man nor your slave girl nor your bull nor your donkey nor any of your domestic animals nor your foreign resident who is inside your cities in order that your slave man and your slave girl may rest the same as you
15  remember that you became a slave in the land of egypt and that jehovah your god brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm
that is why jehovah your god commanded you to observe the sabbath day
16  honor your father and your mother just as jehovah your god has commanded you so that you may live a long time and you may prosper in the land that jehovah your god is giving you
17  you must not murder
18  neither must you commit adultery
19  neither must you steal
20  neither must you testify to a falsehood against your fellow man
21  neither must you desire your fellow mans wife
neither must you selfishly desire your fellow mans house nor his field nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his donkey nor anything that belongs to your fellow man
22  these commandments jehovah spoke to all your congregation on the mountain out of the fire the cloud and the thick gloom with a loud voice and he added nothing further then he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me
23  but as soon as you had heard the voice out of the darkness while the mountain was burning with fire all the heads of your tribes and the elders approached me
24  then you said here jehovah our god has shown us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the fire
today we have seen that god can speak with man and he can keep living
25  now why should we die for this great fire may consume us
if we continue hearing the voice of jehovah our god we are sure to die
26  for who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the fire as we did and yet goes on living
27  you yourself must go near to hear all that jehovah our god will say and you will be the one to tell us all that jehovah our god says to you and we will listen and do it
28  so jehovah heard the words you spoke to me and jehovah said to me i have heard the words that this people have spoken to you
all they have said is good
29  if only they would always have a heart inclined to fear me and to keep all my commandments then it would go well with them and their sons forever
30  go say to them return to your tents
31  but you should stay here with me and let me tell you all the commandments the regulations and the judicial decisions that you should teach to them and that they are to observe in the land that i am giving them to take possession of
32  now you people should be careful to do just as jehovah your god has commanded you
you must not turn to the right or to the left
33  you should walk in all the way that jehovah your god has commanded you in order that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will take possession of
15  at the end of every seven years you should grant a release
2  this is the nature of the release every creditor will release his neighbor from the debt he incurred
he should not demand payment from his neighbor or his brother for it will be proclaimed a release to jehovah
3  you may demand payment from the foreigner but you should release your claim on whatever your brother owes you
4  however no one among you should become poor for jehovah will surely bless you in the land that jehovah your god is giving you to possess as an inheritance
5  but only if you strictly obey the voice of jehovah your god and carefully observe all this commandment that i am giving you today
6  for jehovah your god will bless you just as he has promised you and you will lend to many nations but you will not need to borrow and you will dominate many nations but they will not dominate you
7  if one of your brothers becomes poor among you in one of your cities of the land that jehovah your god is giving you do not harden your heart or be tightfisted toward your poor brother
8  for you should generously open your hand to him and by all means lend whatever he needs or is lacking
9  be careful not to harbor this evil idea in your heart the seventh year the year of the release has approached and hold back your generosity toward your poor brother and give him nothing
if he calls out to jehovah against you it will be a sin on your part
10  you should generously give to him and you should not give to him grudgingly for this is why jehovah your god will bless your every deed and undertaking
11  for there will always be poor people in the land
that is why i am commanding you you should generously open up your hand to your afflicted and poor brother in your land
12  if one of your brothers a hebrew man or woman is sold to you and has served you for six years then in the seventh year you should set him free
13  and if you should set him free do not send him away emptyhanded
14  you should supply him generously with something from your flock your threshing floor and your press for oil and wine
just as jehovah your god has blessed you you should give to him
15  remember that you became a slave in the land of egypt and that jehovah your god redeemed you
that is why i am commanding you to do this today
16  but if he says to you i will not go out from your company because he loves you and your household since he has been happy while with you
17  you should then take an awl and put it through his ear into the door and he will become your slave for life
you should do the same with your slave girl
18  do not consider it a hardship when you set him free and he leaves you because his service to you for six years was worth twice as much as that of a hired worker and jehovah your god has blessed you in everything that was done
19  you should sanctify every firstborn male of your herd and your flock to jehovah your god
you must not do any work with the firstborn of your herd nor shear the firstborn of your flock
20  you and your household should eat it before jehovah your god year by year in the place that jehovah will choose
21  but if it has a defectlameness blindness or any other serious defectyou must not sacrifice it to jehovah your god
22  you should eat it inside your cities the unclean and clean person together as though it were a gazelle or a deer
23  but you must not eat its blood you should pour it out on the ground like water
20  if you go to war against your enemies and you see their horses and chariots and troops that outnumber yours do not be afraid of them for jehovah your god who brought you up out of the land of egypt is with you
2  when you are about to go into battle the priest should approach and address the people
3  he should tell them hear o israel you are about to do battle with your enemies
do not be fainthearted
do not be afraid or be terrified or tremble because of them
4  for jehovah your god is marching with you to fight for you against your enemies and to save you
5  the officers too should tell the people who has built a new house and has not inaugurated it let him return to his house
otherwise he may die in the battle and another man will inaugurate it
6  and who has planted a vineyard and not begun to use it let him go and return to his house
otherwise he may die in the battle and another man will begin to use it
7  and who has become engaged to a woman and has not married her let him go and return to his house
otherwise he might die in the battle and another man will marry her
8  the officers should also ask the people who is fearful and fainthearted he should return to his house so that he may not cause his brothers to lose heart as he has
9  when the officers have finished speaking to the people they should appoint chiefs of the armies to lead the people
10  if you approach a city to fight against it you should also announce to it terms of peace
11  if it gives a peaceful answer to you and opens up to you all the people found there will become yours for forced labor and they will serve you
12  but if it refuses to make peace with you and instead goes to war with you you should besiege it
13  and jehovah your god will certainly give it into your hand and you must strike down every male in it with the sword
14  however the women the children the livestock and everything that is in the city all its spoil you may plunder for yourself and you will eat the spoil of your enemies which jehovah your god has given to you
15  that is what you will do to all the cities very far away from you that are not of the cities of these nearby nations
16  but in the cities of these peoples which jehovah your god is giving you as an inheritance you must not allow any breathing thing to live
17  instead you should devote them completely to destruction the hitʹtites the amʹorites the caʹnaanites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites just as jehovah your god has commanded you
18  so that they may not teach you to follow all their detestable practices that they have done for their gods causing you to sin against jehovah your god
19  if you lay siege to a city and capture it after fighting against it for many days you should not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them
you may eat from them but you should not cut them down
for should you besiege a tree of the field as you would a man
20  you may destroy only a tree that you know is not used for food
you may cut it down and build siegeworks against the city that is making war against you until it falls
1  these are the words that moses spoke to all israel in the region of the jordan in the wilderness on the desert plains in front of suph between paʹran toʹphel laʹban hazeʹroth and diʹzahab
2  it is 11 days from hoʹreb to kaʹdeshbarʹnea by way of mount seʹir
3  in the 40th year in the 11th month on the first of the month moses spoke to the israelites according to all that jehovah had instructed him to tell them
4  this was after he defeated siʹhon the king of the amʹorites who was dwelling in heshʹbon and og the king of baʹshan who was dwelling in ashʹtaroth in edʹrei
5  in the region of the jordan in the land of moʹab moses undertook to explain this law saying
6  jehovah our god told us in hoʹreb you have stayed long enough in this mountainous region
7  turn and set out for the mountainous region of the amʹorites and toward all their neighbors in the arʹabah the mountainous region the shepheʹlah the negʹeb and the seacoast the land of the caʹnaanites and lebʹanon up to the great river the river euphraʹtes
8  see i have set the land before you
go in and take possession of the land about which jehovah swore to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob to give it to them and their offspring after them
9  and i told you at that time i am not able to carry you by myself
10  jehovah your god has multiplied you and here you are today as numerous as the stars of the heavens
11  may jehovah the god of your forefathers multiply you a thousand times as many as you are and may he bless you just as he has promised you
12  how can i bear by myself the burden of you and the load of you and your quarreling
13  select wise discreet and experienced men of your tribes and i will appoint them as heads over you
14  you answered me what you have told us to do is good
15  so i took the heads of your tribes wise and experienced men and appointed them as heads over you chiefs of thousands chiefs of hundreds chiefs of fifties chiefs of tens and officers of your tribes
16  at that time i instructed your judges when you hear a case between your brothers you are to judge with righteousness between a man and his brother or a foreign resident
17  you must not be partial in judgment
you should hear the small one the same as the great one
you must not become intimidated by men for the judgment belongs to god and if a case is too difficult for you you should present it to me and i will hear it
18  at that time i instructed you regarding all the things that you should do
19  then we departed from hoʹreb and marched through all that great and fearsome wilderness that you saw on the way to the mountainous region of the amʹorites just as jehovah our god had commanded us and we eventually came to kaʹdeshbarʹnea
20  i then said to you you have come to the mountainous region of the amʹorites which jehovah our god is giving to us
21  see jehovah your god has given the land over to you
go up take possession of it just as jehovah the god of your forefathers has told you
do not be afraid or terrified
22  however all of you approached me and said let us send men ahead of us to search out the land for us and bring word back to us as to what route we should take and what kind of cities we will encounter
23  the suggestion seemed good to me so i selected 12 of your men one for each tribe
24  they left and went up into the mountainous region and reached the valley of eshʹcol and spied it out
25  they took some of the fruitage of the land and carried it back to us and they brought word back to us the land that jehovah our god is giving us is good
26  but you refused to go up and you rebelled against the order of jehovah your god
27  you kept grumbling in your tents and were saying it was because jehovah hated us that he brought us out of the land of egypt to hand us over to the amʹorites to annihilate us
28  what kind of place are we going to our brothers made us lose heart by saying they are a people greater and taller than we are and their cities are great and fortified to the heavens and we saw the sons of the anʹakim there
29  so i said to you do not be struck with terror or be afraid because of them
30  jehovah your god will go before you and will fight for you just as he did in egypt before your very eyes
31  and you saw in the wilderness how jehovah your god carried you just as a man carries his son everywhere you went until you came to this place
32  but despite all of this you did not put faith in jehovah your god
33  who was going ahead of you on the way to spy out a place for you to camp
he appeared by fire at night and by a cloud in the daytime to show you the way you should walk
34  all the while jehovah heard what you were saying and he became indignant and solemnly swore
35  not one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that i swore to give to your fathers
36  except caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh
he will see it and i will give the land on which he walked to him and to his sons because he has followed jehovah wholeheartedly
37  jehovah even became angry with me because of you and he said you too will not go in there
38  joshua the son of nun who stands before you is the one who will enter into the land
make him strong for he will cause israel to inherit it
39  moreover your children who you said would become plunder and your sons who today do not know good or bad these will enter and i will give it to them to possess
40  but as for you turn back and depart for the wilderness by the way of the red sea
41  at this you said to me we have sinned against jehovah
we will now go up and fight just as jehovah our god has commanded us so each of you put on his weapons of war and you thought it would be an easy thing to go up the mountain
42  but jehovah said to me tell them you must not go up and fight for i will not be with you
if you do you will be defeated by your enemies
43  so i spoke to you but you did not listen
instead you rebelled against jehovahs order and presumptuously tried to go up the mountain
44  then the amʹorites who were dwelling in that mountain came out to meet you and chased you away like bees do and they scattered you in seʹir as far as horʹmah
45  so you returned and began to weep before jehovah but jehovah did not listen to you or pay attention to you
46  that is why you kept dwelling in kaʹdesh for as long as you did
2  then we turned and departed for the wilderness by the way of the red sea just as jehovah had told me and we traveled for many days around mount seʹir
2  finally jehovah said to me
3  you have gone around this mountain long enough
now turn north
4  and give this command to the people you will pass by the border of your brothers the descendants of eʹsau who are dwelling in seʹir and they will be afraid of you and you must be very careful
5  do not engage in hostilities with them for i will not give you any of their land not even the space of a footprint because i have given mount seʹir to eʹsau as his possession
6  you should give them money for the food you will eat and you should pay for the water you will drink
7  for jehovah your god has blessed you in all that you have done
he is fully aware of your walking through this great wilderness
these 40 years jehovah your god has been with you and you have lacked nothing
8  so we passed by our brothers the descendants of eʹsau who are dwelling in seʹir keeping away from the way of the arʹabah from eʹlath and from eʹziongeʹber
next we turned and traveled by the way of the wilderness of moʹab
9  jehovah then said to me do not engage in hostilities or in war with moʹab for i will not give you any of his land as a possession because i have given ar as a possession to the descendants of lot
10  the eʹmim formerly lived there a people great and numerous and tall like the anʹakim
11  the rephʹaim were also considered like the anʹakim and the moʹabites used to call them eʹmim
12  previously the horʹites were living in seʹir but the descendants of eʹsau dispossessed and annihilated them and settled in their place just as israel will do to the land that is their possession which jehovah will certainly give to them
13  now go and cross over the valley of zeʹred
so we crossed over the valley of zeʹred
14  the time it took us to walk from kaʹdeshbarʹnea until we crossed the valley of zeʹred was 38 years until the entire generation of the men of war had perished from the camp just as jehovah had sworn to them
15  jehovahs hand was against them to eliminate them from the camp until they had perished
16  as soon as all the men of war had died off from among the people
17  jehovah spoke to me again saying
18  today you are to pass by the territory of moʹab that is ar
19  when you come near to the amʹmonites do not harass or provoke them for i will not give you any of the land of the amʹmonites as a possession because i have given it to the descendants of lot as their possession
20  this too used to be considered the land of the rephʹaim
the rephʹaim formerly lived there and the amʹmonites used to call them zamzumʹmim
21  they were a great and numerous and tall people like the anʹakim but jehovah annihilated them before the amʹmonites and these drove them out and settled in their place
22  that is what he did for the descendants of eʹsau who now dwell in seʹir when he annihilated the horʹites from before them so that they could dispossess them and dwell in their place to this very day
23  as for the avʹvim they had dwelled in settlements as far as gazʹa until the caphʹtorim who came out from caphʹtor annihilated them and settled in their place
24  get up and make your way across the arʹnon valley
see i have given into your hand siʹhon the amʹorite king of heshʹbon
so begin taking possession of his land and engage him in war
25  this day i will start to put the dread and the fear of you upon all the people under the heavens who hear the report about you
they will be disturbed and will tremble because of you
26  then i sent messengers from the wilderness of kedʹemoth to king siʹhon of heshʹbon with these peaceful words
27  let me pass through your land
i will remain on the road and not turn to the right or to the left
28  i will eat only the food and drink only the water that you will sell to me
just allow me to pass through on foot
29  that is what the descendants of eʹsau dwelling in seʹir and the moʹabites dwelling in ar did for meuntil i pass over the jordan into the land that jehovah our god is giving to us
30  but king siʹhon of heshʹbon did not let us pass through because jehovah your god allowed his spirit to become obstinate and his heart to become hard in order to give him into your hand as is now the case
31  then jehovah said to me see i have already begun to give siʹhon and his land over to you
start to take possession of his land
32  when siʹhon came out along with all his people to meet us in battle at jaʹhaz
33  jehovah our god handed him over to us so that we defeated him his sons and all his people
34  we captured all his cities at that time and devoted every city to destruction including men women and children
we left no survivor
35  we plundered only the livestock for ourselves along with the spoils from the cities that we had captured
36  from aroʹer which is on the rim of the arʹnon valley including the city that is in the valley as far as gilʹead no town was beyond our reach
jehovah our god handed them all over to us
37  however you did not approach the land of the amʹmonites the whole bank of the valley of jabʹbok and the cities of the mountainous region or any other place forbidden by jehovah our god
3  then we turned and went up by way of baʹshan
and og the king of baʹshan came out with all his people to meet us in battle at edʹrei
2  so jehovah said to me do not be afraid of him for i will give him and all his people and his land into your hand and you will do to him just as you did to siʹhon the king of the amʹorites who lived in heshʹbon
3  so jehovah our god also gave king og of baʹshan and all his people into our hand and we kept striking him down until none of his people survived
4  we then captured all his cities
there was no town that we did not take from them60 cities all the region of arʹgob the kingdom of og in baʹshan
5  all these cities were fortified with high walls gates and bars along with a great number of rural towns
6  however we devoted them to destruction just as we had done to king siʹhon of heshʹbon in devoting every city to destruction including men women and children
7  and we took all the livestock and the spoil of the cities for ourselves
8  at that time we seized the land of the two amʹorite kings who were in the region of the jordan from the arʹnon valley as far as mount herʹmon
9  the mountain that the sidoʹnians used to call sirʹion and the amʹorites used to call seʹnir
10  all the cities of the tableland all gilʹead and all baʹshan as far as salʹecah and edʹrei the cities of the kingdom that belonged to og in baʹshan
11  for king og of baʹshan was the last remaining one of the rephʹaim
his bier was made of iron and it is still in rabʹbah of the amʹmonites
it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide by the standard cubit
12  at that time we took possession of this land from aroʹer which is by the arʹnon valley and half of the mountainous region of gilʹead and i have given its cities to the reuʹbenites and the gadʹites
13  and the rest of gilʹead and all baʹshan of the kingdom of og i have given to the half tribe of manasʹseh
all the region of arʹgob which belongs to baʹshan was known as the land of the rephʹaim
14  jaʹir the son of manasʹseh took all the region of arʹgob as far as the boundary of the geshʹurites and the maacʹathites and named those villages of bashan after himself havʹvothjaʹir to this day
15  and i have given gilʹead to maʹchir
16  and to the reuʹbenites and the gadʹites i have given from gilʹead to the arʹnon valley with the middle of the valley as a boundary and as far as jabʹbok the valley that is the boundary of the amʹmonites
17  and the arʹabah and the jordan and the border from chinʹnereth to the sea of the arʹabah the salt sea at the base of the slopes of pisʹgah toward the east
18  i then gave you this command jehovah your god has given you this land to take possession of it
all your valiant men will take up arms and cross over before your brothers the israelites
19  only your wives your children and your livestock i well know that you have a great deal of livestock will continue dwelling in the cities that i have given you
20  until jehovah gives your brothers rest as he does for you and they also have taken possession of the land that jehovah your god will give them across the jordan
then you will come back each one to his possession that i have given you
21  at that time i gave this command to joshua you have seen with your own eyes what jehovah your god has done to these two kings
jehovah will do the same thing to all the kingdoms into which you will cross over
22  you must not be afraid of them for jehovah your god is the one fighting for you
23  at that time i pleaded with jehovah saying
24  o sovereign lord jehovah you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty arm for what god in the heavens or on the earth performs such mighty deeds as you
25  please let me pass over and see the good land that is across the jordan this good mountainous region and lebʹanon
26  but jehovah was still furious with me because of you and he would not listen to me
rather jehovah said to me enough from you never speak to me again about this matter
27  go up to the top of pisʹgah and look to the west and north and south and east and view the land with your eyes for you will not cross over this jordan
28  commission joshua and encourage him and strengthen him because he is the one who will cross over before this people and he is the one who will cause them to inherit the land that you will see
29  all this happened while we were dwelling in the valley in front of bethpeʹor
33  now this is the blessing that moses the man of the true god pronounced on the israelites before his death
2  he said jehovahfrom siʹnai he cameand he shone upon them from seʹir
he shone forth in glory from the mountainous region of paʹranand with him were holy myriadsat his right hand his warriors
3  he had affection for his peopleall their holy ones are in your hand
they were sitting at your feetthey began to listen to your words
4  moses gave us a command a lawas a possession of the congregation of jacob
5  and he became king in jeshʹurunwhen the heads of the people gathered togetheralong with all the tribes of israel
6  let reuʹben live and not die offand may his men not become few
7  and he pronounced this blessing on judah hear o jehovah the voice of judahand may you bring him back to his people
his arms have defended what belongs to himand may you help him against his adversaries
8  of leʹvi he said your thumʹmim and your uʹrim belong to the man loyal to youwhom you put to the test at masʹsah
you began to contend with him by the waters of merʹibah
9  the man who said to his father and his mother i have not shown regard to them
even his brothers he did not acknowledgeand he ignored his own sons
for they kept your wordand they observed your covenant
10  let them instruct jacob in your judicial decisionsand israel in your law
let them offer up incense as a pleasant aroma for youand a whole offering on your altar
11  bless o jehovah his strengthand may you show pleasure in the work of his hands
crush the legs of those who rise up against himso that those who hate him may rise up no more
12  of benjamin he said let the beloved one of jehovah reside in security by himwhile he shelters him the whole dayhe will reside between his shoulders
13  of joseph he said may his land be blessed by jehovahwith the choice things of heavenwith dew and the waters from the springs below
14  with choice things produced by the sunand the choice yield each month
15  with the choicest things from the ancient mountainsand choice things of the enduring hills
16  with the choice things of the earth and what fills itand with the approval of the one residing in the thornbush
may they come upon the head of josephon the crown of the head of the one singled out from his brothers
17  his splendor is like that of a firstborn bulland his horns are the horns of a wild bull
with them he will push peoplesall together to the ends of the earth
they are the tens of thousands of eʹphraimand they are the thousands of manasʹseh
18  of zebʹulun he said rejoice o zebʹulun in your going outand you isʹsachar in your tents
19  they will call peoples to the mountain
there they will offer the sacrifices of righteousness
for they will draw from the abundant wealth of the seasand the hidden hoards of the sand
20  of gad he said blessed is the one widening the borders of gad
he lies there like a lionready to tear off the arm yes the crown of the head
21  he will select the first portion for himselffor there the allotment of a lawgiver is reserved
the heads of the people will gather together

24  of ashʹer he said blessed with sons is ashʹer
may he be favored by his brothersand may he dip his feet in oil
25  iron and copper are your gate locksand you will be secure all your days
26  there is none like the true god of jeshʹurunwho rides through heaven to help youand who rides upon the clouds in his majesty
27  god is a refuge from ancient timeshis everlasting arms are beneath you
and he will drive away the enemy from before youand he will say annihilate them
28  israel will reside in securityand the fountain of jacob will be secludedin a land of grain and new winewhose skies will drip with dew
29  happy you are o israel who is there like youa people enjoying salvation in jehovahyour protective shieldand your majestic sword your enemies will cringe before youand you will tread on their backs
12  these are the regulations and the judicial decisions that you should be careful to carry out all the days that you are alive in the land that jehovah the god of your forefathers will give you to possess
2  you should completely destroy all the places where the nations you will dispossess have served their gods whether on the high mountains or on the hills or under any luxuriant tree
3  you should pull down their altars shatter their sacred pillars burn their sacred poles in the fire and cut down the graven images of their gods obliterating their very names from that place
4  you must not worship jehovah your god in that way
5  rather seek jehovah your god wherever he chooses to establish his name and his place of residence among all your tribes and go there
6  that is where you are to bring your burnt offerings your sacrifices your tithes the contribution from your hand your vow offerings your voluntary offerings and the firstborn of your herd and flock
7  you and your households must eat there before jehovah your god and rejoice in all your undertakings because jehovah your god has blessed you
8  you must not do as we are doing here today with everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes
9  because you have not yet come into the restingplace and the inheritance that jehovah your god is giving you
10  when you do cross the jordan and dwell in the land that jehovah your god is giving you to possess he will certainly give you rest from all your enemies around you and you will dwell in security
11  you will bring all that i am commanding you to the place that jehovah your god chooses to have his name resideyour burnt offerings your sacrifices your tithes the contribution from your hand and every vow offering that you vow to jehovah
12  you will rejoice before jehovah your god you and your sons your daughters your male and female slaves and the levite inside your cities for he has no share or inheritance with you
13  be careful not to offer up your burnt offerings in any other place you may see
14  you should offer your burnt offerings only in the place that jehovah chooses in one of your tribal territories and there you should do everything i am commanding you
15  but whenever you desire it you may slaughter and eat meat according to the blessing that jehovah your god has given you in all your cities
the unclean person and the clean person may eat it as you would eat a gazelle or a deer
16  but you must not eat the blood you should pour it out on the ground like water
17  you will not be allowed to eat within your cities the tenth part of your grain your new wine your oil the firstborn of your herd and flock any of your vow offerings that you vow your voluntary offerings or the contribution from your hand
18  these you are to eat before jehovah your god in the place jehovah your god will chooseyou and your son your daughter your male and female servant and the levite inside your cities and you will rejoice before jehovah your god in all your undertakings
19  be careful not to neglect the levite as long as you live in your land
20  when jehovah your god enlarges your territory just as he has promised you and you say i want to eat meat because you desire to eat meat you may eat meat whenever you desire it
21  if the place that jehovah your god chooses to put his name is far away from you you should then slaughter some of your herd or some of your flock that jehovah has given you just as i have commanded you and you should eat inside your cities whenever you desire it
22  you may eat it as you would eat the gazelle and the deer both the unclean person and the clean person may eat it
23  just be firmly resolved not to eat the blood because the blood is the life and you must not eat the life with the flesh
24  you must not eat it
you should pour it out on the ground like water
25  you must not eat it so that it may go well with you and your children after you because you are doing what is right in jehovahs eyes
26  you should take only the holy things that are yours and your vow offerings when you come to the place that jehovah will choose
27  there you will offer your burnt offerings the flesh and the blood on the altar of jehovah your god and the blood of your sacrifices should be poured out against the altar of jehovah your god but the flesh you may eat
28  be careful to obey all these words that i am commanding you so that it may always go well with you and your sons after you because you are doing what is good and right in the eyes of jehovah your god
29  when jehovah your god annihilates the nations that you are to dispossess and you are living in their land
30  be careful not to be entrapped after they have been annihilated from before you
do not ask about their gods saying how were these nations accustomed to serve their gods i too will do the same
31  you must not do this to jehovah your god because they do for their gods every detestable thing that jehovah hates even burning their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods
32  every word that i am commanding you is what you should be careful to do
you must not add to it nor take away from it
