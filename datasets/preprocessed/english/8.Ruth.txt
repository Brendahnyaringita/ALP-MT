4  now boʹaz went up to the city gate and sat there
and look the repurchaser whom boʹaz had mentioned passed by
at that boʹaz said come here and sit down soandso
and he went over and sat down
2  then boʹaz took ten of the city elders and said sit down here
so they sat down
3  boʹaz now said to the repurchaser naoʹmi who has returned from the fields of moʹab must sell the plot of land that belonged to our brother elimʹelech
4  so i thought i should disclose it to you and say buy it in front of the inhabitants and the elders of my people
if you will repurchase it repurchase it
but if you will not repurchase it tell me so that i will know for you have the claim to repurchase it and i am next in line after you
he replied i am willing to repurchase it
5  then boʹaz said on the day you buy the field from naoʹmi you must also buy it from ruth the moʹabitess the wife of the dead man in order to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance
6  to this the repurchaser said i am unable to repurchase it for i may ruin my own inheritance
repurchase it for yourself with my right of repurchase because i am not able to repurchase it
7  now this was the custom of former times in israel concerning the right of repurchase and exchange to validate every sort of transaction a man had to remove his sandal and give it to the other party and this was the manner of confirming an agreement in israel
8  so when the repurchaser said to boʹaz buy it for yourself he removed his sandal
9  then boʹaz said to the elders and all the people you are witnesses today that i am buying from naoʹmi all that belonged to elimʹelech and all that belonged to chilʹion and mahʹlon
10  i am also acquiring ruth the moʹabitess the wife of mahʹlon as a wife to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance so that the name of the dead man will not be cut off from among his brothers and from the city gate of his home
you are witnesses today
11  at this all the people who were in the city gate and the elders said we are witnesses may jehovah grant the wife who is entering your house to be like rachel and like leʹah both of whom built the house of israel
may you prosper in ephʹrathah and make a good name in bethʹlehem
12  may your house become like the house of peʹrez whom taʹmar bore to judah through the offspring that jehovah will give you by this young woman
13  so boʹaz took ruth and she became his wife
he had relations with her and jehovah let her conceive and she gave birth to a son
14  then the women said to naoʹmi praised be jehovah who has not left you without a repurchaser today
may his name be proclaimed in israel
15  he has restored your life and will sustain you in your old age because he has been born to your daughterinlaw who loves you and is better to you than seven sons
16  naoʹmi took the child and held him to her bosom and she cared for him
17  then the neighbor women gave him a name
they said a son has been born to naoʹmi and they named him oʹbed
he is the father of jesʹse davids father
18  now this is the family line of peʹrez peʹrez became father to hezʹron
19  hezʹron became father to ram ram became father to amminʹadab
20  amminʹadab became father to nahʹshon nahʹshon became father to salʹmon
21  salʹmon became father to boʹaz boʹaz became father to oʹbed
22  oʹbed became father to jesʹse and jesʹse became father to david
1  now in the days when the judges administered justice a famine occurred in the land and a man went from bethʹlehem in judah to reside as a foreigner in the fields of moʹab he along with his wife and his two sons
2  the mans name was elimʹelech his wifes name was naoʹmi and the names of his two sons were mahʹlon and chilʹion
they were ephʹrathites from bethʹlehem in judah
and they came to the fields of moʹab and remained there
3  after some time elimʹelech naoʹmis husband died and she was left with her two sons
4  the men later married moʹabite women one was named orʹpah and the other was named ruth
they remained there for about ten years
5  then the two sons mahʹlon and chilʹion also died and the woman was left without her two children and her husband
6  so she started out with her daughtersinlaw to return from the fields of moʹab for she had heard in moʹab that jehovah had turned his attention to his people by giving them food
7  she left the place where she had been living with both of her daughtersinlaw
as they were walking on the road to return to the land of judah
8  naoʹmi said to both of her daughtersinlaw go return each of you to your mothers home
may jehovah show loyal love to you just as you have shown it to the men who have died and to me
9  may jehovah grant that each of you finds security in the home of your husband
then she kissed them and they wept loudly
10  they kept saying to her no but we will go with you to your people
11  but naoʹmi said return my daughters
why should you go with me can i still give birth to sons who could become your husbands
12  return my daughters
go for i have grown too old to marry
even if i could hope to find a husband tonight and could also bear sons
13  would you keep waiting for them until they could grow up would you refrain from getting remarried for their sakes no my daughters i feel very bitter for you because the hand of jehovah has turned against me
14  again they wept loudly after which orʹpah kissed her motherinlaw and departed
but ruth stuck with her
15  so naoʹmi said look your widowed sisterinlaw has returned to her people and her gods
return with your sisterinlaw
16  but ruth said do not plead with me to abandon you to turn back from accompanying you for where you go i will go and where you spend the night i will spend the night
your people will be my people and your god my god
17  where you die i will die and there i will be buried
may jehovah do so to me and add to it if anything but death should separate me from you
18  when naoʹmi saw that ruth insisted on going with her she stopped trying to convince her
19  and they both continued on their way until they came to bethʹlehem
as soon as they arrived in bethʹlehem the whole city became stirred up over them and women were saying is this naoʹmi
20  she would say to the women do not call me naoʹmi
call me maʹra for the almighty has made life very bitter for me
21  i was full when i went but jehovah made me return emptyhanded
why should you call me naoʹmi when it is jehovah who opposed me and the almighty who caused me calamity
22  this is how naoʹmi returned from the fields of moʹab along with her moʹabite daughterinlaw ruth
they came to bethʹlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest
2  now naoʹmi had a relative on her husbands side who was very wealthy his name was boʹaz and he was of the family of elimʹelech
2  ruth the moʹabitess said to naoʹmi let me go out please to the fields and glean among the ears of grain behind whoever looks on me with favor
so naoʹmi said to her go my daughter
3  at that she went out and began to glean in the field behind the harvesters
by chance she came upon a plot of land belonging to boʹaz who was of the family of elimʹelech
4  just then boʹaz arrived from bethʹlehem and said to the harvesters jehovah be with you
and they replied jehovah bless you
5  boʹaz then asked the young man in charge of the harvesters to whom does this young woman belong
6  the young man in charge of the harvesters answered the young woman is a moʹabitess who returned with naoʹmi from the fields of moʹab
7  she asked please may i glean and gather among the cutoff ears of grain left behind by the harvesters and she has been on her feet since she came this morning until just now when she sat in the shelter for a short rest
8  then boʹaz said to ruth listen my daughter
do not go away to glean in another field and do not go anywhere else stay close by my young women
9  keep your eyes on the field that they harvest and go with them
i have commanded the young men not to touch you
when you are thirsty go to the water jars and drink from what the young men have drawn
10  at that she fell facedown and bowed down to the ground and said to him how have i found favor in your eyes and why have you taken notice of me when i am a foreigner
11  boʹaz answered her a full report was made to me of all you have done for your motherinlaw after the death of your husband and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your relatives to go to a people whom you had not known before
12  may jehovah reward you for what you have done and may there be a perfect wage for you from jehovah the god of israel under whose wings you have come to seek refuge
13  to this she said let me find favor in your eyes my lord because you have comforted me and spoken reassuringly to your servant although i am not even one of your servants
14  boʹaz said to her at mealtime come here eat some of the bread and dip your piece in the vinegar
so she sat down beside the harvesters
he then handed her some roasted grain and she ate and was satisfied and she had something left over
15  when she got up to glean boʹaz commanded his young men let her glean even among the cutoff ears of grain and do not mistreat her
16  you should also be sure to pull out some ears of grain from the bundles for her and leave them behind for her to glean and do not say anything to stop her
17  so she continued to glean in the field until evening
when she beat out what she had gleaned it came to about an eʹphah of barley
18  then she took it and went into the city and her motherinlaw saw what she had gleaned
ruth also took out and gave to her the food that was left over after she had eaten her fill
19  her motherinlaw then said to her where did you glean today where did you work may the one who took notice of you be blessed
so she told her motherinlaw about whom she had worked with saying the name of the man i worked with today is boʹaz
20  at that naoʹmi said to her daughterinlaw may he be blessed by jehovah who has not failed in his loyal love toward the living and the dead
naoʹmi continued the man is related to us
he is one of our repurchasers
21  then ruth the moʹabitess said he also told me stay close by my young people until they have finished my entire harvest
22  naoʹmi said to her daughterinlaw ruth it is better my daughter for you to go out with his young women than to be harassed in another field
23  so she stayed close to the young women of boʹaz and gleaned until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest came to an end
and she kept dwelling with her motherinlaw
3  naoʹmi her motherinlaw now said to her my daughter should i not look for a home for you so that it may go well with you
2  is not boʹaz our relative he is the one whose young women you were with
tonight he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor
3  so wash yourself and rub on some perfumed oil then dress up and go down to the threshing floor
do not make your presence known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking
4  when he lies down take note of the place where he lies down then go and uncover his feet and lie down
he will tell you what you should do
5  at that she replied all that you say to me i will do
6  so she went down to the threshing floor and did all that her motherinlaw had instructed her to do
7  meanwhile boʹaz ate and drank and was feeling good at heart
then he went to lie down at the end of the grain heap
after that she quietly came and uncovered his feet and lay down
8  at midnight the man began to shiver and he leaned forward and saw a woman lying at his feet
9  he said who are you she replied i am ruth your servant
spread out your garment over your servant for you are a repurchaser
10  at that he said may jehovah bless you my daughter
you have shown your loyal love more in this last instance than in the first instance by not going after the young men whether poor or rich
11  and now my daughter have no fear
i will do for you everything that you say for everyone in the city knows that you are an excellent woman
12  while it is true that i am a repurchaser there is a repurchaser more closely related than i am
13  stay here tonight and if he will repurchase you in the morning fine let him repurchase you
but if he does not want to repurchase you i will then repurchase you myself as surely as jehovah lives
lie down here until the morning
14  so she lay at his feet until the morning and then got up before it was light enough for anyone to be recognized
he then said do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor
15  he also said bring the cloak that you are wearing and hold it out
so she held it out and he put six measures of barley in it and put it on her after which he went into the city
16  she went her way to her motherinlaw who now said how did it go for you my daughter she told her everything that the man had done for her
17  she added he gave me these six measures of barley and said to me do not go emptyhanded to your motherinlaw
18  at that she said sit here my daughter until you learn how the matter will turn out for the man will not rest until he settles the matter today
