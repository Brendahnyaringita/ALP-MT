10  woe to those who enact harmful regulationswho constantly draft oppressive decrees
2  to deny the legal claim of the poorto deprive the lowly among my people of justicemaking widows their spoiland fatherless children their plunder
3  what will you do on the day of reckoningwhen destruction comes from afar to whom will you flee for assistanceand where will you leave your wealth
4  nothing remains except to crouch among the prisonersor to fall among the slain
in view of all this his anger has not turned backbut his hand is still stretched out to strike
5  aha the assyrʹianthe rod to express my angerand the staff in their hand for my denunciation
6  i will send him against an apostate nationagainst the people who infuriated mei will command him to take much spoil and much plunderand to trample them like mud in the streets
7  but he will not be inclined this wayand his heart will not scheme this wayfor it is in his heart to annihilateto cut off many nations not a few
8  for he saysare not my princes all kings
9  is not calʹno just like carʹchemish is not haʹmath like arʹpad is not samarʹia like damascus
10  my hand has seized the kingdoms of the worthless godswhose graven images were more than those of jerusalem and samarʹia
11  will i not also do to jerusalem and her idolsjust as i have done to samarʹia and to her worthless gods
12  when jehovah finishes all his work on mount zion and in jerusalem he will punish the king of assyrʹia for his insolent heart and his proud arrogant gaze
13  for he saysi will do this by the strength of my handand with my wisdom for i am wise
i will remove the boundaries of peoplesand pillage their treasuresand i will subdue the inhabitants like a mighty one
14  like a man reaching into a nestmy hand will seize the resources of the peoplesand like one gathering abandoned eggsi will gather the whole earth no one will flutter his wings or open his mouth or chirp
15  will the ax exalt itself over the one who chops with it will the saw exalt itself over the one who saws with it could a staff wave the one who lifts it or could a rod lift up the one who is not made of wood
16  therefore the true lord jehovah of armieswill inflict emaciation on his fat onesand beneath his glory he will kindle a blazing fire
17  israels light will become a fireand his holy one a flameit will blaze up and consume his weeds and his thornbushes in one day
18  he will utterly do away with the glory of his forest and his orchardit will be as when a sick man wastes away
19  the rest of the trees of his forestwill be so few that a boy could list them
20  in that day those remaining of israeland the survivors of the house of jacobwill no longer support themselves on the one who struck thembut they will support themselves on jehovahthe holy one of israel with faithfulness
21  only a remnant will returnthe remnant of jacob to the mighty god
22  for though your people o israelare as the grains of sand of the seaonly a remnant of them will return
an extermination has been decided onand justice will engulf them
23  yes the extermination decided on by the sovereign lord jehovah of armieswill be carried out in the entire land
24  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah of armies says do not be afraid my people who are dwelling in zion because of the assyrʹian who used to strike you with the rod and to lift up his staff against you as egypt did
25  for in a very little while the denunciation will come to an end my anger will be directed to their destruction
26  jehovah of armies will brandish a whip against him as when he defeated midʹian by the rock oʹreb
and his staff will be over the sea and he will raise it as he did with egypt
27  in that day his load will depart from on your shoulderand his yoke from on your neckand the yoke will be broken because of the oil
28  he has come to aiʹathhe has passed through migʹronat michʹmash he deposits his baggage
29  they have passed over the fordthey spend the night at geʹbaraʹmah trembles gibʹeah of saul has fled
30  cry out and scream o daughter of galʹlim pay attention o laʹishah o poor anʹathoth
31  madmeʹnah has run away
the inhabitants of geʹbim have sought shelter
32  this very day he will halt in nob
he shakes his fist at the mountain of the daughter of zionthe hill of jerusalem
33  look the true lord jehovah of armiesis chopping off branches with a terrible crashthe tallest trees are being cut downand the lofty are brought low
34  he strikes down the thickets of the forest with an iron tooland lebʹanon will fall by a mighty one
4  and seven women will grab hold of one man in that day saying we will eat our own breadand wear our own clothingonly let us be called by your nameto take away our disgrace
2  in that day what jehovah makes sprout will be splendid and glorious and the fruitage of the land will be the pride and beauty of the survivors of israel
3  whoever remains in zion and is left over in jerusalem will be called holy all of those in jerusalem written down for life
4  when jehovah washes away the filth of the daughters of zion and rinses away the bloodshed of jerusalem from her midst by the spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning
5  jehovah will also create over the whole site of mount zion and over the place of her conventions a cloud and smoke by day and a bright flaming fire by night for over all the glory there will be a shelter
6  and there will be a booth for shade by day from the heat and for refuge and protection from storms and the rain
26  in that day this song will be sung in the land of judah we have a strong city
he makes salvation its walls and its ramparts
2  open up the gates so that the righteous nation may entera nation that is keeping faithful conduct
3  you will safeguard those who fully lean on youyou will give them continuous peacebecause it is in you that they trust
4  trust in jehovah foreverfor jah jehovah is the eternal rock
5  for he has brought low those inhabiting the height the lofty city
he brings it downhe brings it down to the earthhe casts it down to the dust
6  the foot will trample itthe feet of the afflicted the steps of the lowly
7  the path of the righteous one is upright
because you are uprightyou will smooth out the course of the righteous
8  as we follow the path of your judgments o jehovahour hope is in you
we long for your name and your memorial
9  in the night i long for you with my whole beingyes my spirit keeps looking for youfor when there are judgments from you for the earththe inhabitants of the land learn about righteousness
10  even if the wicked is shown favorhe will not learn righteousness
even in the land of uprightness he will act wickedlyand he will not see the majesty of jehovah
11  o jehovah your hand is raised but they do not see it
they will see your zeal for your people and be put to shame
yes the fire for your adversaries will consume them
12  o jehovah you will grant us peacebecause everything we have doneyou have accomplished for us
13  o jehovah our god other masters besides you have ruled over usbut we make mention of your name alone
14  they are dead they will not live
powerless in death they will not rise up
for you have turned your attention to themto annihilate them and destroy all mention of them
15  you have enlarged the nation o jehovahyou have enlarged the nationyou have glorified yourself
you have greatly extended all the borders of the land
16  o jehovah during distress they turned to youthey poured out their prayer in a whisper when you disciplined them
17  just as a pregnant woman about to give birthhas labor pains and cries out in painso we have been because of you o jehovah
18  we became pregnant we had labor painsbut it is as if we have given birth to wind
we have not brought salvation to the landand no one is born to inhabit the land
19  your dead will live
my corpses will rise up
awake and shout joyfullyyou residents in the dust for your dew is as the dew of the morningand the earth will let those powerless in death come to life
20  go my people enter your inner roomsand shut your doors behind you
hide yourself for a brief momentuntil the wrath has passed by
21  for look jehovah is coming from his placeto call the inhabitants of the land to account for their errorand the land will expose her bloodshedand will no longer cover over her slain
11  a twig will grow out of the stump of jesʹseand a sprout from his roots will bear fruit
2  and the spirit of jehovah will settle upon himthe spirit of wisdom and of understandingthe spirit of counsel and of mightinessthe spirit of knowledge and of the fear of jehovah
3  and he will find delight in the fear of jehovah
he will not judge by what appears to his eyesnor reprove simply according to what his ears hear
4  he will judge the lowly with fairnessand with uprightness he will give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth
he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouthand put the wicked to death with the breath of his lips
5  righteousness will be the belt around his waistand faithfulness the belt of his hips
6  the wolf will reside for a while with the lamband with the young goat the leopard will lie downand the calf and the lion and the fattened animal will all be togetherand a little boy will lead them
7  the cow and the bear will feed togetherand their young will lie down together
the lion will eat straw like the bull
8  the nursing child will play over the lair of a cobraand a weaned child will put his hand over the den of a poisonous snake
9  they will not cause any harmor any ruin in all my holy mountainbecause the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of jehovahas the waters cover the sea
10  in that day the root of jesʹse will stand up as a signal for the peoples
to him the nations will turn for guidanceand his restingplace will become glorious
11  in that day jehovah will again offer his hand a second time to reclaim the remnant of his people who are left from assyrʹia from egypt from pathʹros from cush from eʹlam from shiʹnar from haʹmath and from the islands of the sea
12  he will raise up a signal for the nations and gather the dispersed ones of israel and he will gather together the scattered ones of judah from the four corners of the earth
13  the jealousy of eʹphraim will be goneand those who show hostility to judah will be done away with
eʹphraim will not be jealous of judahnor will judah show hostility toward eʹphraim
14  and they will swoop down on the slopes of the philisʹtines to the westtogether they will plunder the people of the east
they will thrust out their hand against eʹdom and moʹaband the amʹmonites will become their subjects
15  jehovah will divide the gulf of the egyptian seaand wave his hand over the river
with his scorching breath he will strike it in its seven torrentsand he will cause people to walk across in their sandals
16  and there will be a highway out of assyrʹia for the remnant of his people who are leftas there was for israel in the day he came out of the land of egypt
49  listen to me you islandsand pay attention you faraway nations
jehovah has called me before i was born
from the time i was in my mothers womb he has made mention of my name
2  he made my mouth like a sharp swordhe has hidden me in the shadow of his hand
he made me a polished arrowhe concealed me in his quiver
3  he said to me you are my servant o israelthrough whom i will show my splendor
4  but i said i have toiled for nothing
i used up my strength for an unreality in vain
but surely my judgment is with jehovahand my wages with my god
5  and now jehovah the one who formed me from the womb as his servanthas said for me to bring jacob back to himso that israel may be gathered to him
i will be glorified in the eyes of jehovahand my god will have become my strength
6  and he said it is not enough that you are my servantto raise up the tribes of jacoband to bring back those who were preserved of israel
i have also given you as a light of nationsso that my salvation may reach the ends of the earth
7  this is what jehovah the repurchaser of israel his holy one says to the one who is despised to the one who is detested by the nation to the servant of rulers kings will see and rise upand princes will bow downbecause of jehovah who is faithfulthe holy one of israel who has chosen you
8  this is what jehovah says in a time of favor i answered youand in a day of salvation i helped youi kept safeguarding you to give you as a covenant for the peopleto rehabilitate the landto cause them to possess their desolate inheritances
9  to say to the prisoners come out and to those in the darkness show yourselves by the roadways they will feedalong all the worn paths will be their pastures
10  they will not go hungry nor will they thirstnor will scorching heat or the sun beat down on them
for the one who has mercy on them will lead themand he will guide them by the springs of water
11  i will make all my mountains into a roadand my highways will be raised up
12  look these are coming from far awayand look these from the north and from the westand these from the land of siʹnim
13  shout for joy you heavens and rejoice you earth
let the mountains become cheerful with a joyful cry
for jehovah has comforted his peopleand he shows mercy to his own afflicted ones
14  but zion kept saying jehovah has abandoned me and jehovah has forgotten me
15  can a woman forget her nursing childor have no compassion for the son of her womb even if these women forget i would never forget you
16  look on my palms i have engraved you
your walls are always before me
17  your sons hurry back
those who tore you down and devastated you will depart from you
18  raise your eyes and look all around
they are all gathering together
they are coming to you
as surely as i am living declares jehovahyou will clothe yourself with all of them as with ornamentsand you will fasten them on yourself as a bride does
19  although your places were devastated and desolate and your land was in ruinsnow it will become too cramped for those dwelling thereand those who swallowed you down will be far away
20  the sons born when you were bereaved will say in your hearingthis place is too cramped for me
make room for me to dwell here
21  and you will say in your heartwho has fathered these for mesince i am a woman bereaved of children and barrenexiled and taken prisoner who has raised these look i was left all aloneso where have these come from
22  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says look i will raise up my hand to the nationsand i will lift up my signal to the peoples
they will bring your sons in their armsand carry your daughters on their shoulders
23  kings will become caretakers for youand their princesses will be your nurses
they will bow down to you with their faces to the groundand lick the dust of your feetand you will have to know that i am jehovahthose hoping in me will not be put to shame
24  can those already captured be taken from a mighty manor can the captives of the tyrant be rescued
25  but this is what jehovah says even the captives of a mighty man will be taken awayand those captured by the tyrant will be rescued
i will oppose those who oppose youand i will save your own sons
26  i will make those who mistreat you eat their own fleshand as with sweet wine they will become drunk with their own blood
and all people will have to know that i am jehovahyour savior and your repurchaserthe powerful one of jacob
64  if only you had ripped the heavens apart and come downso that the mountains would quake because of you
2  as when a fire ignites the brushwoodand the fire makes the water boilthen your name would be known to your adversariesand the nations would tremble before you
3  when you did aweinspiring things that we dared not hope foryou came down and the mountains quaked before you
4  from of old no one has heard or given earnor has any eye seen a god except youwho acts in behalf of those who keep in expectation of him
5  you have met up with those who joyfully do what is rightthose who remember you and follow your ways
look you became indignant while we kept sinningwe did so for a long time
should we now be saved
6  and we have all become like someone uncleanand all our acts of righteousness are like a menstrual cloth
we will all wither like a leafand our errors will carry us off like the wind
7  there is no one calling on your nameno one who stirs himself to take hold of youfor you have hidden your face from usand you cause us to waste away because of our error
8  but now o jehovah you are our father
we are the clay and you are our potterwe are all the work of your hand
9  do not become too indignant o jehovahand do not remember our error forever
look at us please for we are all your people
10  your holy cities have become a wilderness
zion has become a wildernessjerusalem a wasteland
11  our house of holiness and glorywhere our forefathers praised youhas been burned with fireand all the things we cherished lie in ruins
12  in view of this will you still restrain yourself o jehovah will you remain silent and let us be afflicted so severely
8  jehovah said to me take a large tablet and write on it with an ordinary stylus maʹhershalʹalhashbaz
2  and let me have it confirmed in writing by faithful witnesses uriʹah the priest and zechariʹah the son of jeberechiʹah
3  then i had relations with the prophetess and she became pregnant and in time gave birth to a son
jehovah then said to me name him maʹhershalʹalhashbaz
4  for before the boy knows how to call out my father and my mother the resources of damascus and the spoil of samarʹia will be carried away before the king of assyrʹia
5  jehovah spoke to me again
6  because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of the shiloʹahand they rejoice over reʹzin and the son of remaliʹah
7  therefore look jehovah will bring against themthe mighty and vast waters of the riverthe king of assyrʹia and all his glory
he will come up over all his streambedsand overflow all his banks
8  and sweep through judah
he will flood and pass through reaching to the neckhis outspread wings will fill the breadth of your lando immanʹuel
9  cause harm you peoples but you will be shattered to pieces
listen all you from distant parts of the earth prepare for battle but you will be shattered to pieces prepare for battle but you will be shattered to pieces
10  devise a plan but it will be thwarted say what you like but it will not succeedfor god is with us
11  with his strong hand on me this is what jehovah said to me to warn me away from following the course of this people
12  you should not call a conspiracy what this people calls a conspiracy do not fear what they feardo not tremble at it
13  jehovah of armieshe is the one you should regard as holyhe is the one you should fearand he is the one who should cause you to tremble
14  he will become as a sanctuarybut as a stone to strike againstand as a rock to stumble overto both houses of israelas a trap and a snareto the inhabitants of jerusalem
15  many of them will stumble and fall and be brokenthey will be ensnared and caught
16  wrap up the written confirmationseal up the law among my disciples
17  i will keep in expectation of jehovah who is hiding his face from the house of jacob and i will hope in him
18  look i and the children whom jehovah has given me are as signs and as miracles in israel from jehovah of armies who resides on mount zion
19  and if they say to you inquire of the spirit mediums or of the fortunetellers who chirp and mutter is it not of their god that a people should inquire should they inquire of the dead in behalf of the living
20  instead they should inquire of the law and of the written confirmation when they do not speak according to this word they have no light
21  and each one will pass through the land afflicted and hungry and because he is hungry and indignant he will curse his king and his god as he looks upward
22  then he will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness obscurity and hard times gloom and no brightness
30  woe to the stubborn sons declares jehovahwho carry out plans that are not minewho make alliances but not by my spiritin order to add sin to sin
2  they go down to egypt without consulting meto take shelter under pharʹaohs protectionand to take refuge in the shadow of egypt
3  but the protection of pharʹaoh will become for you a reason for shameand refuge in egypts shadow a cause for humiliation
4  for his princes are in zoʹanand his envoys have reached haʹnes
5  they will all be put to shameby a people who can bring no benefit to themwho offer no help and no benefitonly shame and disgrace
6  a pronouncement against the beasts of the south through the land of distress and hardshipof the lion the roaring lionof the viper and the flying fiery snakethey carry their wealth on the backs of donkeysand their supplies on the humps of camels
but these things will not benefit the people
7  for egypts help is completely useless
so i have called this one raʹhab who sits still
8  now go write it on a tablet in their presenceand inscribe it in a bookso that it may serve for a future dayas a permanent witness
9  for they are a rebellious people deceitful sonssons who are unwilling to hear the law of jehovah
10  they say to the seers do not see and to the visionaries do not tell us truthful visions
tell us flattering things envision deceptive illusions
11  turn aside from the way deviate from the path
quit putting before us the holy one of israel
12  therefore this is what the holy one of israel says since you reject this wordand you trust in fraud and deceitand you rely on these
13  so this error will be for you like a broken walllike a bulging high wall ready to fall
it will crash suddenly in an instant
14  it will be broken like a large potters jarso completely smashed that no fragment among its pieces will be leftto rake the fire from the fireplaceor to scoop water from a puddle
15  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah the holy one of israel says by returning to me and resting you will be savedyour strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust
but you were unwilling
16  instead you said no we will flee on horses so flee you will
and on swift horses we will ride so those pursuing you will be swift
17  a thousand will tremble at the threat of oneat the threat of five you will fleeuntil what is left of you is like a mast on the top of a mountainlike a signal pole on a hill
18  but jehovah is waiting patiently to show you favorand he will rise up to show you mercy
for jehovah is a god of justice
happy are all those keeping in expectation of him
19  when the people dwell in zion in jerusalem you will by no means weep
he will surely show you favor at the sound of your cry for help he will answer you as soon as he hears it
20  though jehovah will give you bread in the form of distress and water in the form of oppression your grand instructor will no longer hide himself and you will see your grand instructor with your own eyes
21  and your own ears will hear a word behind you saying this is the way
walk in it in case you should go to the right or in case you should go to the left
22  and you will defile the silver overlay of your graven images and the golden plating of your metal statues
you will cast them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them be gone
23  and he will give the rain for the seed you sow in the ground and the bread that the ground produces will be abundant and rich
in that day your livestock will graze in spacious pastures
24  and the cattle and the donkeys that work the ground will eat fodder seasoned with sorrel which was winnowed with the shovel and the pitchfork
25  and on every tall mountain and on every high hill will be streams and watercourses in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall
26  and the light of the full moon will become like the light of the sun and the light of the sun will become seven times stronger like the light of seven days in the day that jehovah binds up the breakdown of his people and heals the severe wound from the blow he inflicted
27  look the name of jehovah is coming from far awayburning with his anger and with heavy clouds
his lips are full of indignationand his tongue is like a consuming fire
28  his spirit is like a flooding torrent that reaches clear to the neckto shake the nations in a sieve of destructionand the peoples will have a bridle in their jaws that leads them astray
29  but your song will be like the one sung in the nightwhen you prepare for a festivaland your heart will rejoice like onewho walks with a fluteon his way to the mountain of jehovah to the rock of israel
30  jehovah will make his majestic voice heardand reveal his arm as it descends in the heat of angerwith the flame of a consuming firea cloudburst and a thunderstorm and hailstones
31  for because of the voice of jehovah assyrʹia will be struck with terrorhe will strike it with a rod
32  and every swing of his rod of punishmentthat jehovah will bring down on assyrʹiawill be accompanied by tambourines and harpsas he brandishes his arm against them in battle
33  for his toʹpheth is already preparedit is also made ready for the king
he has made the woodpile deep and widewith an abundance of fire and wood
the breath of jehovah like a torrent of sulfurwill set fire to it
16  send a ram to the ruler of the landfrom seʹla through the wildernessto the mountain of the daughter of zion
2  like a bird chased away from its nestso the daughters of moʹab will be at the fords of arʹnon
3  offer counsel carry out the decision
make your shadow at high noon like the night
conceal the dispersed and do not betray those fleeing
4  may my dispersed ones reside in you o moʹab
become a place of concealment to them because of the destroyer
the oppressor will reach his endthe destruction will come to an endand those trampling others down will perish from the earth
5  then a throne will be firmly established in loyal love
the one who sits on it in the tent of david will be faithfulhe will judge fairly and will swiftly execute righteousness
6  we have heard about the pride of moʹabhe is very proudhis haughtiness and his pride and his furybut his empty talk will come to nothing
7  so moʹab will wail for moʹabthey will all wail
those who are stricken will moan for the raisin cakes of kirharʹeseth
8  for the terraces of heshʹbon have witheredthe vine of sibʹmahthe rulers of the nations have trampled its brightred branchesthey had reached as far as jaʹzerthey had extended into the wilderness
its shoots had spread out and gone as far as the sea
9  that is why i will weep over the vine of sibʹmah as i weep for jaʹzer
with my tears i will drench you o heshʹbon and eleaʹlehbecause the shouting over your summer fruit and your harvest has ended
10  rejoicing and joyfulness have been taken away from the orchardand there are no songs of joy or shouting in the vineyards
the treader no longer treads out wine in the pressesfor i have caused the shouting to cease
11  that is why deep within me i am boisterous over moʹablike the strumming of a harpand my innermost being over kirharʹeseth
12  even when moʹab wears himself out on the high place and goes to pray in his sanctuary he will accomplish nothing
13  this is the word that jehovah previously spoke concerning moʹab
14  and now jehovah says within three years like the years of a hired worker the glory of moʹab will be disgraced with much tumult of every sort and those who remain will be very few and insignificant
35  the wilderness and the parched land will exultand the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron
2  without fail it will blossomit will rejoice and shout for joy
the glory of lebʹanon will be given to itthe splendor of carʹmel and of sharʹon
they will see the glory of jehovah the splendor of our god
3  strengthen the weak handsand make firm the knees that are shaking
4  say to those who are anxious at heart be strong
do not be afraid
look your own god will come with vengeancegod will come with retribution
he will come and save you
5  at that time the eyes of the blind will be openedand the ears of the deaf will be unstopped
6  at that time the lame will leap like the deerand the tongue of the speechless will shout for joy
for waters will burst forth in the wildernessand streams in the desert plain
7  the heatparched ground will become a reedy pooland the thirsty ground springs of water
in the lairs where jackals restedthere will be green grass and reeds and papyrus
8  and a highway will be thereyes a way called the way of holiness
the unclean one will not travel on it
it is reserved for the one walking on the wayno one foolish will stray onto it
9  no lion will be thereand no vicious wild beasts will come on it
they will not be found thereonly the repurchased ones will walk there
10  those redeemed by jehovah will return and come to zion with a joyful cry
unending joy will crown their heads
exultation and rejoicing will be theirsand grief and sighing will flee away
18  woe to the land of whirring insect wingsin the region of the rivers of ethioʹpia
2  it sends envoys by seaacross the waters in papyrus vessels saying go you swift messengersto a tall and smoothskinned nationto a people feared everywhereto a strong conquering nationwhose land is washed away by rivers
3  all you inhabitants of the land and you residents of the earthwhat you see will be like a signal raised on the mountainsand you will hear a sound like the blowing of a horn
4  for this is what jehovah said to me i will remain undisturbed and look on my established placelike the shimmering heat along with the sunlightlike the cloud of dew in the heat of harvest
5  for before the harvestwhen the blossom is finished and the bloom becomes a ripening grapethe shoots will be cut off with pruning shearsand the tendrils will be lopped off and removed
6  they will all be left for the birds of prey of the mountainsand for the beasts of the earth
the birds of prey will spend the summer on themand all the beasts of the earth will spend the harvesttime on them
7  at that time a gift will be brought to jehovah of armiesfrom a tall and smoothskinned nationfrom a people feared everywherefrom a strong conquering nationwhose land is washed away by riversto the place that bears the name of jehovah of armies mount zion
17  a pronouncement against damascus look damascus will cease to be a cityand it will become a heap of ruins
2  the cities of aroʹer will be abandonedthey will become places for flocks to lie downwith no one to make them afraid
3  fortified cities will disappear from eʹphraimand the kingdom from damascusand those remaining of syriawill be like the glory of the israelites declares jehovah of armies
4  in that day the glory of jacob will diminishand his healthy body will grow thin
5  it will be as when the harvester is gathering the standing grainand his arm harvests the ears of grainlike when one gleans grain in the valley of rephʹaim
6  only gleanings will be leftas when an olive tree is beaten only two or three ripe olives remain on the highest branchonly four or five on its fruitbearing branches declares jehovah the god of israel
7  in that day man will look up to his maker and his eyes will gaze at the holy one of israel
8  he will not look to the altars the work of his hands and he will not gaze at what his fingers have made either the sacred poles or the incense stands
9  in that day his fortress cities will become like an abandoned site in the woodlandlike a branch that was abandoned before the israelitesit will become a wasteland
10  for you have forgotten the god of your salvationyou have failed to remember the rock of your fortress
that is why you plant beautiful plantationsand set it with the shoot of a stranger
11  in the day you carefully fence in your plantationin the morning you make your seed sproutbut the harvest will vanish in the day of disease and incurable pain
12  listen there is a commotion of many peopleswho are as boisterous as the seas there is an uproar of nationswhose sound is like the roar of mighty waters
13  the nations will make a sound like the roar of many waters
he will rebuke them and they will flee far awaychased like the chaff of the mountains before a windlike a whirling thistle before a storm wind
14  in the evening there is terror
before morning they are no more
this is the share of those pillaging usand the lot of those plundering us
50  this is what jehovah says where is the divorce certificate of your mother whom i sent away or to which of my creditors did i sell you look it was because of your own errors you were soldand because of your own transgressions your mother was sent away
2  why then was no one here when i came why did no one answer when i called is my hand too short to redeemor is there no power in me to rescue look with my rebuke i dry up the seai make rivers a desert
their fish rot for lack of waterand they die because of thirst
3  i clothe the heavens with gloomand i make sackcloth their covering
4  the sovereign lord jehovah has given me the tongue of those taughtso that i may know how to answer the tired one with the right word
he awakens me morning by morninghe awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones
5  the sovereign lord jehovah has opened my earand i was not rebellious
i did not turn in the opposite direction
6  i offered my back to those striking meand my cheeks to those who plucked them bare
i did not hide my face from humiliating things and from spit
7  but the sovereign lord jehovah will help me
that is why i will not feel humiliated
that is why i have set my face like a flintand i know that i will not be put to shame
8  the one who declares me righteous is near
who can accuse me let us stand up together
who has a case against me let him approach me
9  look the sovereign lord jehovah will help me
who will pronounce me guilty look they will all wear out like a garment
a moth will eat them up
10  who among you fears jehovahand listens to the voice of his servant who has walked in deep darkness without any brightness let him trust in the name of jehovah and support himself on his god
11  look all of you who are igniting a firemaking sparks flywalk in the light of your fireamong the sparks you have set ablaze
this is what you will have from my hand in sheer pain you will lie down
9  however the gloom will not be as when the land had distress as in former times when the land of zebʹulun and the land of naphʹtali were treated with contempt
but at a later time he will cause it to be honoredthe way by the sea in the region of the jordan galʹilee of the nations
2  the people who were walking in the darknesshave seen a great light
as for those dwelling in the land of deep shadowlight has shone on them
3  you have made the nation populousyou have made its rejoicing great
they rejoice before youas people rejoice in the harvesttimeas those who joyfully divide up the spoil
4  for you have shattered to pieces the yoke of their loadthe rod on their shoulders the staff of the taskmasteras in the day of midʹian
5  every boot that shakes the earth as it marchesand every garment soaked in bloodwill become fuel for the fire
6  for a child has been born to usa son has been given to usand the rulership will rest on his shoulder
his name will be called wonderful counselor mighty god eternal father prince of peace
7  to the increase of his rulershipand to peace there will be no endon the throne of david and on his kingdomin order to establish it firmly and to sustain itthrough justice and righteousnessfrom now on and forever
the zeal of jehovah of armies will do this
8  jehovah sent a word against jacoband it has come against israel
9  and all the people will know iteʹphraim and the inhabitants of samarʹiawho say in their haughtiness and in their insolence of heart
10  bricks have fallenbut we will build with hewn stone
sycamore trees have been cut downbut we will replace them with cedars
11  jehovah will raise up reʹzins adversaries against himand will stir his enemies to action
12  syria from the east and the philisʹtines from the westthey will devour israel with open mouths
in view of all this his anger has not turned backbut his hand is still stretched out to strike
13  for the people have not returned to the one who strikes themthey have not sought jehovah of armies
14  jehovah will cut off from israelhead and tail shoot and rush in one day
15  the elder and highly respected one is the headand the prophet giving false instruction is the tail
16  those leading this people are causing them to wanderand those who are being led are confused
17  that is why jehovah will not rejoice over their young menand he will have no mercy on their fatherless children and their widowsbecause all of them are apostates and evildoersand every mouth is speaking senselessness
in view of all this his anger has not turned backbut his hand is still stretched out to strike
18  for wickedness burns like a fireconsuming thornbushes and weeds
it will set fire to the thickets of the forestand they will go up in clouds of smoke
19  in the fury of jehovah of armiesthe land has been set on fireand the people will become fuel for the fire
no one will spare even his brother
20  one will cut down on the rightbut still be hungryand one will eat on the leftbut will not be satisfied
each will devour the flesh of his own arm
21  manasʹseh will devour eʹphraimand eʹphraim manasʹseh
together they will be against judah
in view of all this his anger has not turned backbut his hand is still stretched out to strike
28  woe to the showy crown of the drunkards of eʹphraimand the fading blossom of its glorious beautywhich is on the head of the fertile valley of those overcome with wine
2  look jehovah has someone strong and mighty
like a thundering hailstorm a destructive windstormlike a thunderstorm of powerful floodwatershe will forcefully hurl it down to the earth
3  the showy crowns of the drunkards of eʹphraimwill be trampled underfoot
4  and the fading flower of its glorious beautywhich is on the head of the fertile valleywill become like the early fig before summer
when someone sees it he swallows it as soon as it is in his hand
5  in that day jehovah of armies will become a glorious crown and a beautiful garland to those left of his people
6  and he will become a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment and a source of mightiness to those who repel the attack at the gate
7  and these also go astray because of winetheir alcoholic beverages make them stagger
priest and prophet go astray because of alcoholthe wine confuses themand they stagger from their alcoholtheir vision makes them go astrayand they stumble in judgment
8  for their tables are full of filthy vomitthere is no place without it
9  to whom will one impart knowledgeand to whom will one explain the message to those who have just been weaned from milkthose just taken away from the breasts
10  for it is command after command command after commandline by line line by linea little here a little there
11  so by means of those with stammering speech and a foreign language he will speak to this people
12  he once told them this is the restingplace
let the weary one rest this is the place of refreshment but they refused to listen
13  so to them the word of jehovah will be command after command command after commandline by line line by linea little here a little there so that when they walkthey will stumble and fall backwardand be broken and ensnared and caught
14  so hear the word of jehovah you boastersyou rulers of this people in jerusalem
15  for you men say we have made a covenant with deathand with the grave we have made an agreement
when the raging flash flood passes throughit will not reach usfor we have made a lie our refugeand we have hidden ourselves in falsehood
16  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says here i am laying as a foundation in zion a tested stonethe precious cornerstone of a sure foundation
no one exercising faith will panic
17  and i will make justice the measuring lineand righteousness the leveling tool
the hail will sweep away the refuge of liesand the waters will flood out the hiding place
18  your covenant with death will be dissolvedand your agreement with the grave will not stand
when the raging flash flood passes throughyou will be crushed by it
19  as often as it passes throughit will sweep you awayfor it will pass through morning after morningduring the day and during the night
only terror will make them understand what was heard
20  for the bed is too short to stretch out onand the woven sheet is too narrow to wrap up in
21  for jehovah will rise up as at mount peraʹzimhe will rouse himself as in the valley near gibʹeonthat he may do his deedhis strange deedand that he may carry out his workhis unusual work
22  now do not scoffso that your bonds may not be further tightenedfor i have heard from the sovereign lord jehovah of armiesthat an extermination has been determined for all the land
23  give ear and listen to my voicepay attention and listen to what i say
24  does the plower keep plowing all day before he sows seed does he continually break up and harrow his ground
25  when he has smoothed out its surfacedoes he not then scatter black cumin and sow cuminand does he not plant wheat millet and barley in their placesand spelt around the edges
26  for he teaches him the right wayhis god instructs him
27  for black cumin is not crushed with a threshing sledgeand a wagon wheel is not driven over cumin
rather black cumin is beaten out with a rodand cumin with a staff
28  does a person crush grain for bread no he does not thresh it incessantlyand when he drives the roller of his wagon over it with his horseshe does not crush it
29  this also comes from jehovah of armieswhose counsel is wonderfuland whose achievements are great
27  in that day jehovah with his harsh and great and strong swordwill turn his attention to leviʹathan the gliding serpentto leviʹathan the twisting serpentand he will kill the monster that is in the sea
2  in that day sing to her a vineyard of foaming wine
3  i jehovah am safeguarding her
every moment i water her
i safeguard her night and dayso that no one may harm her
4  there is no wrath in me
who will confront me with thornbushes and weeds in the battle i will trample them and set them on fire all together
5  otherwise let him hold fast to my stronghold
let him make peace with mepeace let him make with me
6  in the coming days jacob will take rootisrael will blossom and sproutand they will fill the land with produce
7  must he be struck with the stroke of the one striking him or must he be killed as with the slaughter of his slain
8  with a startling cry you will contend with her when sending her away
he will expel her with his fierce blast in the day of the east wind
9  so in this way the error of jacob will be atoned forand this will be the full fruitage when his sin is taken away he will make all the stones of the altarlike chalkstones that have been pulverizedand no sacred poles or incense stands will be left
10  for the fortified city will be desertedthe pastures will be forsaken and abandoned like a wilderness
there the calf will graze and lie downand will consume her branches
11  when her twigs have dried upwomen will come and break them offmaking fires with them
for this people is without understanding
that is why their maker will show them no mercyand the one who formed them will show them no favor
12  in that day jehovah will beat out the fruit from the flowing stream of the river to the wadi of egypt and you will be gathered up one after the other o people of israel
13  in that day a great horn will be blown and those who are perishing in the land of assyrʹia and those dispersed in the land of egypt will come and bow down to jehovah in the holy mountain in jerusalem
63  who is this coming from eʹdomfrom bozʹrah with brightcolored garmentsthis one with splendid clothingmarching in his great power it is i the one speaking in righteousnessthe one with great power to save
2  why is your clothing redand why are your garments like those of one treading the winepress
3  i have trodden the wine trough alone
no one from the peoples was with me
i kept treading them in my angerand i kept trampling them in my wrath
my garments were spattered with their bloodand i have stained all my clothing
4  for the day of vengeance is in my heartand the year of my repurchased ones has come
5  i looked but there was no one to helpi was appalled that no one offered support
so my arm brought me salvationand my own wrath supported me
6  i trampled peoples in my angeri made them drunk with my wrathand poured out their blood on the ground
7  i will mention jehovahs acts of loyal lovethe praiseworthy acts of jehovahbecause of all that jehovah has done for usthe many good things he has done for the house of israelaccording to his mercy and his great loyal love
8  for he said surely they are my people sons who will not be disloyal
so he became their savior
9  during all their distress it was distressing to him
and his own personal messenger saved them
in his love and compassion he repurchased themand he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old
10  but they rebelled and grieved his holy spirit
he then turned into their enemyand he fought against them
11  and they remembered the days of oldthe days of moses his servant where is the one who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock where is the one who put within him his holy spirit
12  the one who made his glorious arm go with the right hand of mosesthe one who split the waters before themto make an everlasting name for himself
13  the one who made them walk through the surging watersso that they walked without stumblinglike a horse in the open country
14  just like livestock when they go down into the valley plainthe spirit of jehovah made them rest
this is how you led your peopleto make a majestic name for yourself
15  look down from heaven and seefrom your lofty abode of holiness and glory
where are your zeal and your mightinessthe stirring of your compassions and your mercy they are withheld from me
16  for you are our fatheralthough abraham may not know usand israel may not recognize usyou o jehovah are our father
our repurchaser of long ago is your name
17  why do you o jehovah let us wander from your ways why do you let our hearts become hard so that we do not fear you return for the sake of your servantsthe tribes of your inheritance
18  your holy people possessed it for a short time
our adversaries have trampled on your sanctuary
19  for too long we have become like those you never ruled overlike those never called by your name
7  now in the days of aʹhaz son of joʹtham son of uzziʹah the king of judah king reʹzin of syria and peʹkah son of remaliʹah the king of israel came up to wage war against jerusalem but he could not capture it
2  a report was made to the house of david syria has joined forces with eʹphraim
and the heart of aʹhaz and the heart of his people began to tremble like the trees of the forest shaking in the wind
3  jehovah then said to isaiah go out please to meet aʹhaz you and your son sheʹarjaʹshub at the end of the conduit of the upper pool by the highway of the laundrymans field
4  you must say to him take care to stay calm
do not be afraid and do not lose heart because of these two stumps of smoldering logs because of the hot anger of reʹzin and syria and the son of remaliʹah
5  for syria with eʹphraim and the son of remaliʹah have plotted harm against you saying
6  let us go up against judah and tear it apart and conquer it for ourselves and let us appoint the son of tabʹeel as its king
7  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says it will not succeednor will it take place
8  for the head of syria is damascusand the head of damascus is reʹzin
within just 65 yearseʹphraim will be completely shattered and cease to be a people
9  the head of eʹphraim is samarʹiaand the head of samarʹia is the son of remaliʹah
unless you have firm faithyou will not be firmly established
10  jehovah continued speaking to aʹhaz
11  ask for a sign from jehovah your god it may be as deep as the grave or as high as the sky
12  but aʹhaz said i will not ask nor will i put jehovah to the test
13  isaiah then said listen please o house of david
is it not enough that you try the patience of men must you also try the patience of god
14  therefore jehovah himself will give you a sign look the young woman will become pregnant and will give birth to a son and she will name him immanʹuel
15  he will eat butter and honey by the time that he knows how to reject the bad and choose the good
16  for before the boy knows how to reject the bad and choose the good the land of the two kings whom you dread will be completely abandoned
17  jehovah will bring against you and against your people and against the house of your father a time such as has not come since the day eʹphraim broke away from judah for he will bring the king of assyrʹia
18  in that day jehovah will whistle for the flies from the distant streams of the nile of egypt and for the bees in the land of assyrʹia
19  and they will all come and settle down on the steep valleys on the rocky clefts on all the thornbushes and on all the watering places
20  in that day by means of a hired razor from the region of the river by means of the king of assyrʹia jehovah will shave the head and the hair of the legs and it will sweep away the beard as well
21  in that day a man will keep alive a young cow of the herd and two sheep
22  and because of the abundance of milk he will eat butter for everyone remaining in the land will eat butter and honey
23  in that day wherever there used to be 1000 vines worth 1000 pieces of silver there will be only thornbushes and weeds
24  men will go there with bow and arrow because all the land will become thornbushes and weeds
25  and all the mountains that used to be cleared with a hoe you will not go near for fear of thornbushes and weeds they will become a grazing place for bulls and a trampling ground of sheep
55  come all you thirsty ones come to the water you with no money come buy and eat yes come buy wine and milk without money and without cost
2  why do you keep paying out money for what is not breadand why spend your earnings for what brings no satisfaction listen intently to me and eat what is goodand you will find great delight in what is truly rich
3  incline your ear and come to me
listen and you will keep aliveand i will readily make with you an everlasting covenantin harmony with the expressions of loyal love to david which are faithful
4  look i made him a witness to the nationsa leader and commander to the nations
5  look you will call a nation that you do not knowand those of a nation who have not known you will run to youfor the sake of jehovah your god the holy one of israelbecause he will glorify you
6  search for jehovah while he may be found
call to him while he is near
7  let the wicked man leave his wayand the evil man his thoughtslet him return to jehovah who will have mercy on himto our god for he will forgive in a large way
8  for my thoughts are not your thoughtsand your ways are not my ways declares jehovah
9  for as the heavens are higher than the earthso my ways are higher than your waysand my thoughts than your thoughts
10  for just as the rain and the snow pour down from heavenand do not return there until they saturate the earth making it produce and sproutgiving seed to the sower and bread to the eater
11  so my word that goes out of my mouth will be
it will not return to me without resultsbut it will certainly accomplish whatever is my delightand it will have sure success in what i send it to do
12  for you will go out with rejoicingand in peace you will be brought back
the mountains and the hills will become cheerful before you with a joyful cryand the trees of the field will all clap their hands
13  instead of thornbushes the juniper tree will growand instead of the stinging nettle the myrtle tree will grow
and it will bring fame to jehovahan everlasting sign that will never perish
51  listen to me you who are pursuing righteousnessyou who are seeking jehovah
look to the rock from which you were hewnand to the quarry from which you were dug
2  look to abraham your fatherand to sarah who gave birth to you
for he was only one when i called himand i blessed him and made him many
3  for jehovah will comfort zion
he will bring comfort to all her ruinsand he will make her wilderness like eʹdenand her desert plain like the garden of jehovah
exultation and rejoicing will be found in herthanksgiving and melodious song
4  pay attention to me o my peopleand give ear to me my nation
for a law will go out from meand my justice i will establish as a light to the peoples
5  my righteousness draws near
my salvation will go outand my arms will judge the peoples
in me the islands will hopeand for my arm they will wait
6  raise your eyes to the heavensand look at the earth below
for the heavens will disperse in fragments like smokethe earth will wear out like a garmentand its inhabitants will die like gnats
but my salvation will be eternaland my righteousness will never fail
7  listen to me you who know righteousnessthe people with my law in their heart
do not be afraid of the taunts of mortal menand do not be terrified because of their insults
8  for a moth will eat them up just like a garmentthe clothes moth will devour them like wool
but my righteousness will last foreverand my salvation for all generations
9  awake awake clothe yourself with strengtho arm of jehovah awake as in the days of long ago as in past generations
was it not you who broke raʹhab to pieceswho pierced the sea monster
10  are you not the one who dried up the sea the waters of the vast deep the one who made the depths of the sea a roadway for the repurchased ones to cross
11  the redeemed ones of jehovah will return
they will come to zion with a joyful cryand unending joy will crown them
exultation and rejoicing will be theirsand grief and sighing will flee away
12  i myself am the one comforting you
why should you be afraid of a mortal man who will dieand of a son of man who will wither like green grass
13  why do you forget jehovah your makerthe one who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundation of the earth and all day long you were in constant fear of the rage of the oppressoras though he were in a position to bring you to ruin
where now is the rage of the oppressor
14  the one bent over in chains will soon be set freehe will not die and go into the pitnor will his bread be lacking
15  but i am jehovah your godwho stirs up the sea and makes its waves boisterousjehovah of armies is his name
16  i will put my words in your mouthand with the shadow of my hand i will cover youin order to plant the heavens and to lay the foundation of the earthand to say to zion you are my people
17  awake awake rise up o jerusalemyou who have drunk from the hand of jehovah his cup of wrath
you have drunk the gobletyou have drained out the cup causing staggering
18  not one of all the sons whom she bore is there to guide herand not one of all the sons whom she raised has taken hold of her hand
19  these two things have befallen you
who will sympathize with you destruction and devastation hunger and sword who will comfort you
20  your sons have fainted
they lie down at every street cornerlike wild sheep in the net
they are full of the wrath of jehovah the rebuke of your god
21  so please listen to thiso woman afflicted and drunk though not with wine
22  this is what your lord jehovah says your god who defends his people look i will take from your hand the cup causing staggeringthe goblet my cup of wrathyou will never drink it again
23  i will put it into the hand of your tormentorsthose who said to you bow down so that we may walk over you so you made your back like the groundlike a street for them to walk on
34  come close to hear you nationsand pay attention you peoples
let the earth and that which fills it listenthe land and all its produce
2  for jehovahs indignation is against all the nationsand his wrath is against all their army
he will devote them to destructionhe will give them to the slaughter
3  their slain will be thrown outand the stench of their carcasses will ascendthe mountains will melt because of their blood
4  all the army of the heavens will rot awayand the heavens will be rolled up like a scroll
all their army will wither awayas a withered leaf falls from the vineand a shriveled fig from the fig tree
5  for in the heavens my sword will be drenched
it will descend on eʹdom in judgmenton the people whom i devoted to destruction
6  jehovah has a sword it will be covered with blood
it will be covered with the fatwith the blood of young rams and goatswith the kidney fat of rams
for jehovah has a sacrifice in bozʹraha great slaughter in the land of eʹdom
7  the wild bulls will go down with themthe young bulls with the powerful ones
their land will be drenched in bloodand their dust will be soaked with fat
8  for jehovah has a day of vengeancea year of retribution for the legal case over zion
9  her streams will be changed into pitchand her dust into sulfurand her land will become like burning pitch
10  by night or by day it will not be extinguishedits smoke will keep ascending forever
from generation to generation she will remain devastatedno one will pass through her forever and ever
11  the pelican and the porcupine will possess herand longeared owls and ravens will reside in her
he will stretch out over her the measuring line of emptinessand the plumb line of desolation
12  none of her nobles will be called to the kingshipand all her princes will come to nothing
13  thorns will grow in her fortified towersnettles and thorny weeds in her fortresses
she will become a lair of jackalsan enclosure for ostriches
14  desert creatures will meet up with howling animalsand the wild goat will call to its companion
yes there the nightjar will settle and find a place of rest
15  there the arrow snake will make its nest and lay eggsand it will hatch them and gather them in its shadow
yes there the kites will gather each one with her mate
16  search in the book of jehovah and read it out loud not one of them will be missingnone of them will be lacking a matefor it is the mouth of jehovah that has given the orderand it is his spirit that has gathered them together
17  he is the one who has cast the lot for themand his own hand has measured out their assigned place
they will possess it for all timethey will reside in it throughout all generations
62  for the sake of zion i will not keep silentand for the sake of jerusalem i will not keep stilluntil her righteousness shines like a bright lightand her salvation burns like a torch
2  the nations will see your righteousness o womanand all kings your glory
and you will be called by a new namewhich jehovahs own mouth will designate
3  you will become a crown of beauty in the hand of jehovaha royal turban in the palm of your god
4  no more will you be called an abandoned womanand your land will no longer be called desolate
but you will be called my delight is in herand your land will be called the married one
for jehovah will take delight in youand your land will be as one married
5  for just as a young man marries a virginyour sons will marry you
with the rejoicing of a bridegroom over a brideyour god will rejoice over you
6  upon your walls o jerusalem i have commissioned watchmen
continuously all day long and all night long they should not be silent
you who make mention of jehovahdo not rest
7  and do not give him any rest until he firmly establishes jerusalemyes until he makes her the praise of the earth
8  jehovah has sworn an oath with his right hand with his strong arm i will no longer give your grain as food to your enemiesnor will foreigners drink your new wine for which you have toiled
9  but those gathering it will eat it and they will praise jehovahand those collecting it will drink it in my holy courtyards
10  pass through pass through the gates
clear the way for the people
build up build up the highway
rid it of stones
raise up a signal for the peoples
11  look jehovah has proclaimed to the ends of the earth say to the daughter of zionlook your salvation is coming
look his reward is with himand the wage he pays is before him
12  they will be called the holy people those repurchased by jehovahand you will be called sought after a city not abandoned
57  the righteous one has perishedbut no one takes it to heart
loyal men are taken awaywith no one discerning that the righteous one has been taken awaybecause of the calamity
2  he enters into peace
they rest on their beds all who walk uprightly
3  but as for you come closeryou sons of a sorceressyou children of an adulterer and a prostitute
4  whom are you making fun of against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue are you not the children of transgressionthe children of deceit
5  those who are inflamed with passion among big treesunder every luxuriant treewho slaughter the children in the valleysunder the clefts of the crags
6  with the smooth stones of the valley is your portion
yes these are your lot
even to them you pour out drink offerings and offer gifts
should i be satisfied with these things
7  on a mountain high and lofty you prepared your bedand you went up there to offer sacrifice
8  behind the door and the doorpost you set up your memorial
you left me and uncovered yourselfyou went up and made your bed spacious
and you made a covenant with them
you loved sharing their bedand you gazed at the male organ
9  you went down to melʹech with oiland with an abundance of perfume
you sent your envoys far offso that you descended to the grave
10  you have toiled in following your many waysbut you did not say it is hopeless you found renewed strength
that is why you do not give up
11  whom did you dread and fearso that you started to lie you did not remember me
you took nothing to heart
have i not kept silent and withdrawn so you showed no fear of me
12  i will make known your righteousness and your worksand they will not benefit you
13  when you cry for helpyour collection of idols will not rescue you
a wind will carry all of them awaya mere breath will blow them awaybut the one who takes refuge in me will inherit the landand will take possession of my holy mountain
14  it will be said build up build up a road prepare the way remove any obstacle from the way of my people
15  for this is what the high and lofty one sayswho lives forever and whose name is holy i reside in the high and holy placebut also with those crushed and lowly in spiritto revive the spirit of the lowlyand to revive the heart of those being crushed
16  for i will not oppose them foreveror always remain indignantfor a mans spirit would grow feeble because of meeven the breathing creatures that i have made
17  i was indignant at his sinful pursuit of dishonest gainso i struck him i hid my face and i was indignant
but he kept walking as a renegade following the way of his heart
18  i have seen his waysbut i will heal him and lead himand restore comfort to him and to his mourning ones
19  i am creating the fruit of the lips
continuous peace will be given to the one who is far away and the one who is near says jehovahand i will heal him
20  but the wicked are like the restless sea that cannot calm downand its waters keep tossing up seaweed and mire
21  there is no peace says my god for the wicked
46  bel bends down neʹbo stoops over
their idols are loaded on animals on beasts of burdenlike baggage that burdens the weary animals
2  they stoop and bend down togetherthey cannot rescue the loadsand they themselves go into captivity
3  listen to me o house of jacob and all you who remain of the house of israelyou whom i have supported from birth and carried from the womb
4  until you grow old i will be the sameuntil your hair is gray i will keep bearing you
as i have done i will carry you and bear you and rescue you
5  to whom will you liken me or make me equal or compare meso that we should resemble each other
6  there are those who lavish gold from their pursethey weigh out the silver on the scale
they hire a metalworker and he makes it into a god
then they prostrate themselves yes they worship it
7  they lift it to their shouldersthey carry it and put it in its place and it just stands there
it does not move from its place
they cry out to it but it does not answerit cannot rescue anyone from distress
8  remember this and take courage
take it to heart you transgressors
9  remember the former things of long agothat i am god and there is no other
i am god and there is no one like me
10  from the beginning i foretell the outcomeand from long ago the things that have not yet been done
i say my decision will standand i will do whatever i please
11  i am calling a bird of prey from the sunrisefrom a distant land the man to carry out my decision
i have spoken and i will bring it about
i have purposed it and i will also carry it out
12  listen to me you who are stubborn of heartyou who are far away from righteousness
13  i have brought my righteousness nearit is not far awayand my salvation will not delay
i will grant salvation in zion my splendor to israel
37  as soon as king hezekiʹah heard this he ripped his garments apart and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of jehovah
2  then he sent eliʹakim who was in charge of the household shebʹna the secretary and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to the prophet isaiah the son of aʹmoz
3  they said to him this is what hezekiʹah says this day is a day of distress of rebuke and of disgrace for the children are ready to be born but there is no strength to give birth
4  perhaps jehovah your god will hear the words of the rabʹshakeh whom the king of assyrʹia his lord sent to taunt the living god and he will call him to account for the words that jehovah your god has heard
so offer up a prayer in behalf of the remnant who have survived
5  so the servants of king hezekiʹah went in to isaiah
6  and isaiah said to them this is what you should say to your lord this is what jehovah says do not be afraid because of the words that you heard the words with which the attendants of the king of assyrʹia blasphemed me
7  here i am putting a thought in his mind and he will hear a report and return to his own land and i will make him fall by the sword in his own land
8  after the rabʹshakeh heard that the king of assyrʹia had pulled away from laʹchish he returned to him and found him fighting against libʹnah
9  now the king heard it said about king tirhaʹkah of ethioʹpia he has come out to fight against you
when he heard this he sent messengers again to hezekiʹah saying
10  this is what you should say to king hezekiʹah of judah do not let your god in whom you trust deceive you by saying jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of assyrʹia
11  look you have heard what the kings of assyrʹia did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction
will you alone be rescued
12  did the gods of the nations that my forefathers destroyed rescue them where are goʹzan haʹran reʹzeph and the people of eʹden who were in telasʹsar
13  where is the king of haʹmath the king of arʹpad and the king of the cities of sepharvaʹim and of heʹna and of ivʹvah
14  hezekiʹah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them
hezekiʹah then went up to the house of jehovah and spread them out before jehovah
15  and hezekiʹah began to pray to jehovah and say
16  o jehovah of armies the god of israel sitting enthroned above the cherubs you alone are the true god of all the kingdoms of the earth
you made the heavens and the earth
17  incline your ear o jehovah and hear open your eyes o jehovah and see hear all the words that sennachʹerib has sent to taunt the living god
18  it is a fact o jehovah that the kings of assyrʹia have devastated all the lands as well as their own land
19  and they have thrown their gods into the fire because they were not gods but the work of human hands wood and stone
that is why they could destroy them
20  but now o jehovah our god save us out of his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are god o jehovah
21  isaiah son of aʹmoz then sent this message to hezekiʹah this is what jehovah the god of israel says because you prayed to me concerning king sennachʹerib of assyrʹia
22  this is the word that jehovah has spoken against him the virgin daughter of zion despises you she scoffs at you
the daughter of jerusalem shakes her head at you
23  whom have you taunted and blasphemed against whom have you raised your voiceand lifted your arrogant eyes it is against the holy one of israel
24  through your servants you have taunted jehovah and saidwith the multitude of my war chariotsi will ascend the heights of mountainsthe remotest parts of lebʹanon
i will cut down its lofty cedars its choice juniper trees
i will enter its highest retreats its densest forests
25  i will dig wells and drink watersi will dry up the streams of egypt with the soles of my feet
26  have you not heard from long ago it was determined
from days gone by i have prepared it
now i will bring it about
you will turn fortified cities into desolate piles of ruins
27  their inhabitants will be helplessthey will be terrified and put to shame
they will become as vegetation of the field and green grassas grass of the roofs that is scorched by the east wind
28  but i well know when you sit when you go out when you come inand when you are enraged against me
29  because your rage against me and your roaring have reached my ears
so i will put my hook in your nose and my bridle between your lipsand i will lead you back the way you came
30  and this will be the sign for you this year you will eat what grows on its own and in the second year you will eat grain that sprouts from that but in the third year you will sow seed and reap and you will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage
31  those of the house of judah who escape those who are left will take root downward and produce fruit upward
32  for a remnant will go out of jerusalem and survivors from mount zion
the zeal of jehovah of armies will do this
33  therefore this is what jehovah says about the king of assyrʹia he will not come into this cityor shoot an arrow thereor confront it with a shieldor cast up a siege rampart against it
34  by the way he came he will returnhe will not come into this city declares jehovah
35  i will defend this city and save it for my own sakeand for the sake of my servant david
36  and the angel of jehovah went out and struck down 185000 men in the camp of the assyrʹians
when people rose up early in the morning they saw all the dead bodies
37  so king sennachʹerib of assyrʹia departed and returned to ninʹeveh and stayed there
38  and as he was bowing down at the house of his god nisʹroch his own sons adramʹmelech and shareʹzer struck him down with the sword and then escaped to the land of arʹarat
and his son eʹsarhadʹdon became king in his place
45  this is what jehovah says to his anointed one to cyruswhose right hand i have taken hold ofto subdue nations before himto disarm kingsto open before him the double doorsso that the gates will not be shut
2  before you i will goand the hills i will level
the copper doors i will break in piecesand the iron bars i will cut down
3  i will give you the treasures in the darknessand the hidden treasures in the concealed placesso that you may know that i am jehovahthe god of israel who is calling you by your name
4  for the sake of my servant jacob and of israel my chosen onei am calling you by your name
i am giving you a name of honor although you did not know me
5  i am jehovah and there is no one else
there is no god except me
i will strengthen you although you did not know me
6  in order that people may knowfrom the rising of the sun to its settingthat there is none besides me
i am jehovah and there is no one else
7  i form light and create darknessi make peace and create calamityi jehovah am doing all these things
8  you heavens rain down from abovelet the clouds pour down righteousness
let the earth open up and be fruitful with salvationand let it cause righteousness to spring up at the same time
i jehovah have created it
9  woe to the one who contends with his makerfor he is just an earthenware fragmentamong the other earthenware fragments lying on the ground should the clay say to the potter what are you making or should your work say he has no hands
10  woe to the one who says to a father what do you become father to and to a woman what are you giving birth to
11  this is what jehovah says the holy one of israel the one who formed him would you question me about the things comingand command me about my sons and the works of my hands
12  i made the earth and created man on it
i stretched out the heavens with my own handsand i give orders to all their army
13  i have raised up a man in righteousnessand i will make all his ways straight
he is the one who will build my cityand set my exiles free without a price or a bribe says jehovah of armies
14  this is what jehovah says the profit of egypt and the merchandise of ethioʹpia and the sabeʹans tall of staturewill come over to you and become yours
they will walk behind you in chains
they will come over and bow down to you
to you they will say in prayer surely god is with youand there is no one else there is no other god
15  truly you are a god who conceals himselfo god of israel the savior
16  they will all be put to shame and be humiliatedthe makers of idols will all go off in disgrace
17  but israel will be saved by jehovah with an everlasting salvation
you will not be put to shame or disgraced for all eternity
18  for this is what jehovah saysthe creator of the heavens the true godthe one who formed the earth its maker who firmly established itwho did not create it simply for nothing but formed it to be inhabited i am jehovah and there is no one else
19  i did not speak in a concealed place in a land of darknessi did not say to the offspring of jacobseek me simply for nothing
i am jehovah who speaks what is righteous and declares what is upright
20  gather together and come
approach together you escapees from the nations
they know nothing those who carry around carved imagesand pray to a god that cannot save them
21  make your report present your case
let them consult together in unity
who foretold this long agoand declared it from times past is it not i jehovah there is no other god but mea righteous god and a savior there is none besides me
22  turn to me and be saved all the ends of the earthfor i am god and there is no one else
23  by myself i have swornthe word has gone out of my mouth in righteousnessand it will not return to me every knee will bendevery tongue will swear loyalty
24  and say surely in jehovah are true righteousness and strength
all those enraged against him will come before him in shame
25  in jehovah all the offspring of israel will prove to be rightand in him they will make their boast
52  awake awake clothe yourself with strength o zion put on your beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for no more will the uncircumcised and unclean one enter into you
2  shake off the dust rise and take a seat o jerusalem
loosen the bonds on your neck o captive daughter of zion
3  for this is what jehovah says you were sold for nothingand without money you will be repurchased
4  for this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says at first my people went down to egypt to live there as foreignersthen assyrʹia oppressed them without cause
5  what then should i do here declares jehovah
for my people were taken for nothing
those ruling over them keep howling in triumph declares jehovahand constantly all day long my name is treated with disrespect
6  for that reason my people will know my namefor that reason they will know in that day that i am the one speaking
look it is i
7  how beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the one bringing good newsthe one proclaiming peacethe one bringing good news of something betterthe one proclaiming salvationthe one saying to zion your god has become king
8  listen your watchmen raise their voice
in unison they shout joyfullyfor they will see it clearly when jehovah gathers back zion
9  become cheerful shout joyfully in unison you ruins of jerusalemfor jehovah has comforted his people he has repurchased jerusalem
10  jehovah has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nationsall the ends of the earth will see the acts of salvation of our god
11  turn away turn away get out of there touch nothing unclean get out from the midst of her keep yourselves cleanyou who are carrying the utensils of jehovah
12  for you will not depart in panicnor will you have to fleefor jehovah will go ahead of youand the god of israel will be your rear guard
13  look my servant will act with insight
he will be raised up highhe will be elevated and greatly exalted
14  just as there were many who stared at him in amazementfor his appearance was disfigured more than that of any other manand his stately form more than that of mankind
15  so he will startle many nations
kings will shut their mouths before himbecause they will see what they had not been toldand give consideration to what they had not heard
23  a pronouncement about tyre wail you ships of tarʹshish for the port has been destroyed it cannot be entered
from the land of kitʹtim it has been revealed to them
2  be silent you inhabitants of the coastland
the merchants from siʹdon who cross the sea have filled you
3  over many waters went the grain of shiʹhorthe harvest of the nile her revenuebringing the profit of the nations
4  be ashamed o siʹdon you stronghold of the seabecause the sea has said i have not had birth pains and i have not given birthnor have i brought up young men or raised young women
5  as when they heard the report about egyptpeople will be in anguish over the report about tyre
6  cross over to tarʹshish wail you inhabitants of the coastland
7  is this your city that was exultant from long ago from her early times her feet used to take her to distant lands to reside
8  who has decided this against tyrethe bestower of crownswhose merchants were princeswhose tradesmen were honored in all the earth
9  jehovah of armies himself has decided thisto profane her pride over all her beautyto humiliate all those who were honored throughout the earth
10  cross over your land like the nile river o daughter of tarʹshish
there is no longer any shipyard
11  he has stretched his hand out over the seahe has shaken kingdoms
jehovah has ordered the annihilation of phoeniʹcias strongholds
12  and he says you will exult no moreo oppressed one the virgin daughter of siʹdon
get up cross over to kitʹtim
even there you will find no rest
13  look the land of the chaldeʹans
this is the peopleassyrʹia was not the onethey made her a place for those haunting the desert
they have erected their siege towersthey have stripped bare her fortified towersreducing her to a crumbling ruin
14  wail you ships of tarʹshishfor your stronghold has been destroyed
15  in that day tyre will be forgotten for 70 years the same as the lifetime of one king
at the end of 70 years it will happen to tyre as in the song of a prostitute
16  take a harp go around the city o forgotten prostitute
play your harp skillfullysing many songsso that they will remember you
17  at the end of 70 years jehovah will turn his attention to tyre and she will return to her hire and prostitute herself with all the worlds kingdoms on the face of the earth
18  but her profit and her hire will become something holy to jehovah
it will not be stored or laid away because her hire will be for those dwelling before jehovah so that they may eat to satisfaction and wear elegant clothing
42  look my servant whom i support my chosen one whom i have approved i have put my spirit in himhe will bring justice to the nations
2  he will not cry out or raise his voiceand he will not make his voice heard in the street
3  no crushed reed will he breakand no smoldering wick will he extinguish
in faithfulness he will bring justice
4  he will not grow dim or be crushed until he establishes justice in the earthand the islands keep waiting for his law
5  this is what the true god jehovah saysthe creator of the heavens and the grand one who stretched them outthe one who spread out the earth and its producethe one who gives breath to the people on itand spirit to those who walk on it
6  i jehovah have called you in righteousnessi have taken hold of your hand
i will safeguard you and give you as a covenant for the peopleand as a light of the nations
7  for you to open the blind eyesto bring the prisoner out of the dungeonand those sitting in darkness out of the prison
8  i am jehovah
that is my namei give my glory to no one elsenor my praise to graven images
9  see the first things have come to passnow i am declaring new things
before they spring up i tell you about them
10  sing to jehovah a new songhis praise from the ends of the earthyou who go down to the sea and all that fills ityou islands and their inhabitants
11  let the wilderness and its cities raise their voicethe settlements where keʹdar dwells
let the inhabitants of the crag shout joyfullylet them cry out from the top of the mountains
12  let them attribute glory to jehovahand declare his praise in the islands
13  jehovah will go out like a mighty man
he will awaken his zeal like a warrior
he will shout yes he will let out a war cryhe will show himself mightier than his enemies
14  i have kept quiet for a long time
i remained silent and restrained myself
like a woman giving birthi will groan pant and gasp all at once
15  i will devastate mountains and hillsand dry up all their vegetation
i will turn rivers into islandsand dry up reedy pools of water
16  i will lead the blind in a way that they do not knowand cause them to tread on unfamiliar paths
i will turn the darkness before them into lightand turn the rugged terrain into level land
this is what i will do for them and i will not abandon them
17  they will be turned back and will be utterly put to shamethose who trust in carved imagesthose who say to metal statues you are our gods
18  listen you who are deaflook and see you who are blind
19  who is blind except my servantso deaf as the messenger i send who is so blind as the one rewardedso blind as the servant of jehovah
20  you see many things but you do not keep watch
you open your ears but you do not listen
21  for the sake of his righteousnessjehovah has taken pleasure in magnifying the law and making it glorious
22  but this is a people plundered and pillagedall of them are trapped in the holes and hidden in the prisons
they have been plundered with no one to rescue themand pillaged with no one to say bring them back
23  who among you will hear this who will pay attention and listen for the time to come
24  who has given jacob for pillageand israel to the plunderers is it not jehovah the one against whom we sinned in his ways they refused to walkand his law they would not obey
25  so he kept pouring out on him wrathhis anger and the fury of war
it consumed everything around him but he paid no attention
it blazed up against him but he would not take it to heart
22  a pronouncement about the valley of vision what is the matter with you that you have all gone up to the roofs
2  you were full of turmoila boisterous city an exultant town
your slain were not slain with the swordnor did they die in battle
3  all your dictators have fled together
they were taken prisoner without need of a bow
all who were found were taken prisonereven though they had fled far away
4  that is why i said turn your eyes away from meand i will weep bitterly
do not insist on comforting meover the destruction of the daughter of my people
5  for it is a day of confusion and of defeat and of panicfrom the sovereign lord jehovah of armiesin the valley of vision
there is a demolishing of the walland a cry to the mountain
6  eʹlam picks up the quiverwith manned chariots and horsesand kir uncovers the shield
7  your choicest valleyswill become full of war chariotsand the horses will take their positions at the gate
8  and the screen of judah will be removed
in that day you will look toward the armory of the house of the forest
9  and you will see the many breaches of the city of david
and you will collect the waters of the lower pool
10  you will count the houses of jerusalem and you will pull down the houses to reinforce the wall
11  and you will make a basin between the two walls for the water of the old pool but you will not look to its grand maker and you will not see the one who formed it long ago
12  in that day the sovereign lord jehovah of armieswill call for weeping and mourningfor shaved heads and the wearing of sackcloth
13  but instead there is celebration and rejoicingthe killing of cattle and the slaughtering of sheepthe eating of meat and the drinking of wine
let us eat and drink for tomorrow we will die
14  then jehovah of armies revealed himself in my ears this error will not be atoned in your behalf until you people die says the sovereign lord jehovah of armies
15  this is what the sovereign lord jehovah of armies says go in to this steward to shebʹna who is in charge of the house and say
16  what is your interest here and who is there of interest to you here that you hewed out a burial place here for yourself he is hewing out his burial place in a high place he is cutting out a restingplace for himself in a crag
17  look jehovah will hurl you down violently o man and seize you forcibly
18  he will certainly wrap you up tightly and hurl you like a ball into a wide land
there you will die and there your glorious chariots will be a disgrace to your masters house
19  and i will depose you from your position and throw you out of your office
20  in that day i will call my servant eliʹakim the son of hilkiʹah
21  and i will clothe him with your robe and firmly bind your sash around him and i will give your authority into his hand
and he will be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to the house of judah
22  and i will put the key of the house of david on his shoulder
he will open and no one will shut and he will shut and no one will open
23  i will drive him in as a peg in a lasting place and he will become as a throne of glory to the house of his father
24  and they will hang on him all the glory of the house of his father the descendants and the offspring all the small vessels the bowlshaped vessels as well as all the large jars
25  in that day declares jehovah of armies the peg that is driven in a lasting place will be removed and it will be cut down and fall and the load that it supported will fall to ruin for jehovah himself has spoken
38  in those days hezekiʹah became sick and was at the point of death
the prophet isaiah the son of aʹmoz came and said to him this is what jehovah says give instructions to your household for you will die you will not recover
2  at that hezekiʹah turned his face to the wall and began to pray to jehovah
3  i beg you o jehovah remember please how i have walked before you faithfully and with a complete heart and i have done what was good in your eyes
and hezekiʹah began to weep profusely
4  then the word of jehovah came to isaiah saying
5  go back and say to hezekiʹah this is what jehovah the god of david your forefather says i have heard your prayer
i have seen your tears
here i am adding 15 years to your life
6  and i will rescue you and this city out of the hand of the king of assyrʹia and i will defend this city
7  this is the sign from jehovah to show you that jehovah will carry out the word that he has spoken
8  here i will make the declining shadow of the sun on the stairway of aʹhaz go back ten steps
so the sun went back ten steps on the stairway that it had already descended
9  a writing of king hezekiʹah of judah when he became sick and recovered from his sickness
10  i said in the middle of my lifei must go into the gates of the grave
i will be deprived of my remaining years
11  i said i will not see jah jah in the land of the living
i will look no more on mankindwhen i am with the inhabitants of the place where everything ceases
12  my own dwelling has been pulled out and removed from melike the tent of a shepherd
i have rolled up my life like a loom workerhe cuts me off like the threads of the warp
from daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end
13  i calm myself until the morning
like a lion he keeps breaking all my bonesfrom daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end
14  like the swift or the thrush so i keep chirpingi keep cooing like the dove
my eyes look wearily to the height o jehovah i am in great distressbe my support
15  what can i say he has spoken to me and acted
i will walk humbly all my yearsbecause of my bitter distress
16  o jehovah by these things every man livesand in them is the life of my spirit
you will restore me to health and preserve me alive
17  look instead of peace i had great bitternessbut in your fondness for meyou preserved me from the pit of destruction
you have thrown all my sins behind your back
18  for the grave cannot glorify youdeath cannot praise you
those who go down into the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness
19  the living the living can praise youjust as i can this day
a father can give his sons knowledge about your faithfulness
20  o jehovah save meand we will play my songs on stringed instrumentsall the days of our life at the house of jehovah
21  isaiah then said bring a cake of pressed dried figs and apply it to the boil so that he may recover
22  hezekiʹah had asked what is the sign that i will go up to the house of jehovah
32  look a king will reign for righteousnessand princes will rule for justice
2  and each one will be like a hiding place from the winda place of concealment from the rainstormlike streams of water in a waterless landlike the shadow of a massive crag in a parched land
3  then the eyes of those seeing will no longer be pasted shutand the ears of those hearing will pay attention
4  the heart of those who are impetuous will ponder over knowledgeand the stammering tongue will speak fluently and clearly
5  the senseless one will no longer be called generousand the unprincipled man will not be called noble
6  for the senseless one will speak nonsenseand his heart will devise harmful thingsto promote apostasy and to speak what is wayward against jehovahto cause the hungry one to go unfedand to deprive the thirsty one of something to drink
7  the devices of the unprincipled man are badhe promotes shameful conductto ruin the afflicted one with lieseven when the poor speaks what is right
8  but the generous one has generous intentionsand in generous endeavors he perseveres
9  you complacent women get up and listen to my voice you carefree daughters pay attention to what i say
10  in a little over a year you who are carefree will shudderbecause no fruit will have been gathered when the grape harvest ends
11  tremble you complacent women shudder you who are carefree strip yourselves bareand put sackcloth around your hips
12  beat your breasts in lamentationover the desirable fields and the fruitful vine
13  for the ground of my people will be covered with thorns and briarsthey will cover all the houses of rejoicingyes the city of exultation
14  for the fortified tower has been forsakenthe noisy city has been abandoned
oʹphel and the watchtower have become a permanent wastelanda delight for wild donkeysa pasture for the flocks
15  until the spirit is poured out on us from aboveand the wilderness becomes an orchardand the orchard is regarded as a forest
16  then justice will reside in the wildernessand righteousness will dwell in the orchard
17  the result of true righteousness will be peaceand the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquillity and security
18  my people will dwell in a peaceful abiding placein secure dwellings and in tranquil restingplaces
19  but the hail will flatten the forestand the city will be completely leveled
20  happy are you who sow seed alongside all waterswho send out the bull and the donkey
6  in the year that king uzziʹah died i saw jehovah sitting on a lofty and elevated throne and the skirts of his robe filled the temple
2  seraphs were standing above him each had six wings
each covered his face with two and covered his feet with two and each of them would fly about with two
3  and one called to the other holy holy holy is jehovah of armies
the whole earth is filled with his glory
4  and the pivots of the thresholds quivered at the sound of the shouting and the house was filled with smoke
5  then i said woe to me i am as good as deadfor i am a man of unclean lipsand i live among a people of unclean lipsfor my eyes have seen the king jehovah of armies himself
6  at that one of the seraphs flew to me and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar
7  he touched my mouth and said look this has touched your lips
your guilt is removedand your sin is atoned for
8  then i heard the voice of jehovah saying whom shall i send and who will go for us and i said here i am send me
9  and he replied go and say to this people you will hear again and againbut you will not understandyou will see again and againbut you will not get any knowledge
10  make the heart of this people unreceptivemake their ears unresponsiveand paste their eyes togetherso that they may not see with their eyesand hear with their earsso that their heart may not understandand they may not turn back and be healed
11  at this i said how long o jehovah then he said until the cities crash in ruins without an inhabitantand the houses are without peopleand the land is ruined and desolate
12  until jehovah removes men far awayand the deserted condition of the land becomes very extensive
13  but there will still be a tenth in it and it will again be burned like a big tree and like an oak which after they are cut down leave a stump a holy seed will be its stump
31  woe to those who go down to egypt for assistancewho rely on horseswho trust in war chariots because they are numerousand in warhorses because they are mighty
but they do not look to the holy one of israeland they do not search for jehovah
2  but he is also wise and will bring calamityand he will not take back his words
he will rise up against the house of evildoersand against those who help wrongdoers
3  the egyptians though are mere men and not godtheir horses are flesh and not spirit
when jehovah stretches out his handwhoever offers help will stumbleand whoever is helped will fallthey will all perish at the same time
4  for this is what jehovah has said to me just as the lion growls a strong young lion over its preywhen a whole group of shepherds is called together against itand it is not terrified by their voiceor daunted by their commotionso will jehovah of armies come down to wage warover mount zion and over her hill
5  like swooping birds so jehovah of armies will defend jerusalem
he will defend her and save her
he will spare her and rescue her
6  return to the one against whom you have blatantly revolted o people of israel
7  for in that day each one will reject his worthless gods of silver and his valueless gods of gold which your own hands sinfully made
8  and the assyrʹian will fall by the sword not of a manand a sword not of a human will devour him
he will flee because of the swordand his young men will be put to forced labor
9  his crag will pass away because of sheer frightand his princes will be terrified because of the signal pole declares jehovahwhose light is in zion and whose furnace is in jerusalem
21  a pronouncement against the wilderness of the sea it is coming like storm winds that sweep through in the southfrom the wilderness from a fearsome land
2  a harsh vision has been told to me the treacherous one is acting treacherouslyand the destroyer is destroying
go up o eʹlam lay siege o meʹdia i will put an end to all the sighing she caused
3  that is why i am in great anguish
convulsions have seized melike those of a woman giving birth
i am too distressed to heari am too disturbed to see
4  my heart falters i shudder in terror
the twilight i longed for makes me tremble
5  set the table and arrange the seats eat and drink get up you princes anoint the shield
6  for this is what jehovah said to me go post a lookout and have him report what he sees
7  and he saw a war chariot with a team of horsesa war chariot of donkeysa war chariot of camels
he watched carefully with great attentiveness
8  then he called out like a lion upon the watchtower o jehovah i am standing constantly by dayand i am stationed at my guardpost every night
9  look at what is coming men in a war chariot with a team of horses then he spoke up and said she has fallen babylon has fallen all the graven images of her gods he has shattered to the ground
10  o my people who have been threshedthe product of my threshing floori have reported to you what i have heard from jehovah of armies the god of israel
11  a pronouncement against duʹmah someone is calling out to me from seʹir watchman what of the night watchman what of the night
12  the watchman said the morning is coming and also the night
if you would inquire inquire
come again
13  a pronouncement against the desert plain in the forest in the desert plain you will spend the nighto caravans of deʹdan
14  bring water to meet the thirsty oneyou inhabitants of the land of teʹmaand bring bread for the one fleeing
15  for they have fled from the swords from the drawn swordfrom the bent bow and from the cruelty of the war
16  for this is what jehovah said to me within one year like the years of a hired worker all the glory of keʹdar will come to an end
17  the remaining bowmen of the warriors of keʹdar will be few for jehovah the god of israel has spoken
25  o jehovah you are my god
i exalt you i praise your namefor you have done wonderful thingsthings purposed from ancient timesin faithfulness in trustworthiness
2  for you have turned a city into a pile of stonesa fortified town into a crumbling ruin
the foreigners tower is a city no moreit will never be rebuilt
3  that is why a strong people will glorify youthe city of tyrannical nations will fear you
4  for you have become a stronghold to the lowlya stronghold to the poor in his distressa refuge from the rainstormand a shade from the heat
when the blast of the tyrants is like a rainstorm against a wall
5  as the heat in a parched landyou subdue the uproar of strangers
like heat is subdued by the shadow of a cloudso the song of the tyrants is silenced
6  in this mountain jehovah of armies will make for all the peoplesa banquet of rich dishesa banquet of fine wineof rich dishes filled with marrowof fine filtered wine
7  in this mountain he will do away with the shroud that is enveloping all the peoplesand the covering that is woven over all the nations
8  he will swallow up death foreverand the sovereign lord jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces
the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earthfor jehovah himself has spoken it
9  in that day they will say look this is our god we have hoped in himand he will save us
this is jehovah we have hoped in him
let us be joyful and rejoice in the salvation by him
10  for the hand of jehovah will rest on this mountainand moʹab will be trampled on in its placelike straw trampled into a pile of manure
11  he will slap out his hands into itlike a swimmer slapping out his hands to swimand he will bring down its haughtinesswith the skillful movements of his hands
12  and the fortified city with your high walls of securityhe will bring downhe will knock it down to the ground to the very dust
13  a pronouncement against babylon that isaiah the son of aʹmoz saw in vision
2  raise up a signal on a mountain of bare rocks
call out to them wave your handso that they may come into the entrances of the nobles
3  i have issued the command to those whom i have appointed
i have summoned my warriors to express my angermy proudly exultant ones
4  listen a crowd in the mountainsit sounds like a numerous people listen the uproar of kingdomsof nations gathered together jehovah of armies is mustering the army for war
5  they are coming from a distant landfrom the extremity of the heavensjehovah and the weapons of his wrathto bring ruin to all the earth
6  wail for the day of jehovah is near it will come as a destruction from the almighty
7  that is why all hands will go limpand every mans heart will melt with fear
8  the people are panicstricken
they are seized with convulsions and painlike a woman in labor
they look at one another in horrorwith faces inflamed by anguish
9  look the day of jehovah is comingcruel both with fury and with burning angerto make the land an object of horrorand to annihilate the lands sinners from it
10  for the stars of the heavens and their constellationswill not give off their lightthe sun will be dark when it risesand the moon will not shed its light
11  i will call the inhabited earth to account for its badnessand the wicked for their error
i will put an end to the pride of the presumptuousand i will humble the haughtiness of tyrants
12  i will make mortal man scarcer than refined goldand humans scarcer than the gold of oʹphir
13  that is why i will make the heavens trembleand the earth will be shaken out of its placeat the fury of jehovah of armies in the day of his burning anger
14  like a hunted gazelle and like a flock with no one to gather themeach will return to his own peopleeach will flee to his own land
15  whoever is found will be pierced throughand whoever is caught will fall by the sword
16  their children will be dashed to pieces before their eyestheir houses will be lootedand their wives will be raped
17  here i am raising up against them the medeswho regard silver as nothingand who take no delight in gold
18  their bows will shatter young menthey will show no pity on the fruit of the wombnor mercy to children
19  and babylon the most glorious of kingdomsthe beauty and the pride of the chaldeʹanswill be like sodʹom and gomorʹrah when god overthrew them
20  she will never be inhabitednor will she be a place to reside in throughout all generations
no arab will pitch his tent thereand no shepherds will rest their flocks there
21  the desert creatures will lie down theretheir houses will be filled with eagle owls
the ostriches will reside thereand wild goats will skip about there
22  howling creatures will cry out in her towersand jackals in her luxurious palaces
her time is near and her days will not be prolonged
14  for jehovah will show mercy to jacob and he will again choose israel
he will settle them in their land and the foreign residents will join them and attach themselves to the house of jacob
2  and peoples will take them and bring them to their own place and the house of israel will possess them as male and female servants in jehovahs land and they will be the captors of those who held them captive and they will have in subjection those who were forcing them to work
3  in the day when jehovah gives you rest from your pain and from your turmoil and from the hard slavery imposed on you
4  you will recite this proverb against the king of babylon how the one forcing others to work has met his end how the oppression has ended
5  jehovah has broken the rod of the wickedthe staff of the rulers
6  the one furiously striking peoples with unceasing blowsthe one angrily subduing nations with relentless persecution
7  the whole earth now rests free of disturbance
people cry out for joy
8  even the juniper trees rejoice over youalong with the cedars of lebʹanon
they say ever since you have fallenno woodcutter comes up against us
9  even the grave underneath is stirred upto meet you when you come
because of you it awakens those powerless in deathall the oppressive leaders of the earth
it makes all the kings of the nations rise from their thrones
10  all of them speak up and say to youhave you also become weak like us have you become like us
11  down to the grave your pride has been broughtthe sound of your stringed instruments
maggots are spread beneath you as a bedand worms are your covering
12  how you have fallen from heaveno shining one son of the dawn how you have been cut down to the earthyou who vanquished nations
13  you said in your heart i will ascend to the heavens
above the stars of god i will lift up my throneand i will sit down on the mountain of meetingin the remotest parts of the north
14  i will go up above the tops of the cloudsi will make myself resemble the most high
15  instead you will be brought down to the graveto the remotest parts of the pit
16  those seeing you will stare at youthey will closely examine you sayingis this the man who was shaking the earthwho made kingdoms tremble
17  who made the inhabited earth like the wildernessand overthrew its citieswho refused to let his prisoners go home
18  all other kings of the nationsyes all of them lie down in gloryeach one in his own tomb
19  but you are discarded without a gravelike a detested sproutclothed with the slain who were stabbed with the swordwho go down to the stones of a pitlike a carcass trampled underfoot
20  you will not join them in a gravefor you destroyed your own landyou killed your own people
the offspring of evildoers will never again be named
21  prepare a slaughtering block for his sonsbecause of the guilt of their forefathersso that they will not rise up and take over the earthand fill the land with their cities
22  i will rise up against them declares jehovah of armies
and i will wipe out from babylon name and remnant and descendants and posterity declares jehovah
23  and i will make her a possession of porcupines and a region of marshes and i will sweep her with the broom of annihilation declares jehovah of armies
24  jehovah of armies has sworn just as i have intended so it will occurand just as i have decided that is what will come true
25  i will crush the assyrʹian in my landand i will trample him on my mountains
his yoke will be removed from themand his load will be removed from their shoulder
26  this is what has been decided against all the earthand this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations
27  for jehovah of armies has decidedand who can thwart it his hand is stretched outand who can turn it back
28  in the year that king aʹhaz died this pronouncement was made
29  do not rejoice philisʹtia any of youjust because the staff of the one striking you has been broken
for from the root of the serpent will come a poisonous snakeand its offspring will be a flying fiery snake
30  while the firstborn of the lowly feedand the poor lie down in securityi will put your root to death with famineand what is left of you will be killed
31  wail o gate cry out o city all of you will lose heart o philisʹtia for a smoke is coming from the northand there are no stragglers in his ranks
32  how should they answer the messengers of the nation that jehovah has laid the foundation of zionand that the lowly ones of his people will take refuge in her
29  woe to arʹiel arʹiel the city where david encamped continue year after yearlet the cycle of festivals continue
2  but i will bring distress on arʹieland there will be mourning and lamentationand she will become to me like an altar hearth of god
3  i will encamp on all sides against youand i will besiege you with a palisadeand raise up siegeworks against you
4  you will be brought lowfrom the ground you will speakand what you say will be muffled by dust
your voice will come from the groundlike the voice of a spirit mediumand your words will chirp from the dust
5  the crowd of your enemies will be like fine powderthe crowd of the tyrants just like the blowing chaff
and it will happen in an instant suddenly
6  jehovah of armies will give you his attentionwith thunder and earthquake and a great noisewith storm wind and tempest and the flames of a consuming fire
7  then the crowd of all the nations waging war against arʹielall those waging war against herthe siege towers against herand those bringing distress on herwill become like a dream a vision of the night
8  yes it will be just as when someone hungry dreams that he is eatingbut he wakes up hungryand as when someone thirsty dreams that he is drinkingbut he wakes up tired and thirsty
so it will happen with the crowd of all the nationsthat wage war against mount zion
9  be stunned and amazedblind yourselves and be blinded
they are drunk but not with winethey are staggering but not from alcohol
10  for jehovah has poured a spirit of deep sleep on youhe has closed your eyes the prophetsand he has covered your heads the visionaries
11  every vision becomes for you like the words of a sealed book
when they give it to someone who can read saying read this out loud please he will say i cannot for it is sealed up
12  and when they give the book to someone who cannot read saying read this please he will say i cannot read at all
13  jehovah says this people approaches me with their mouthand they honor me with their lipsbut their heart is far removed from meand their fear of me is based on commands of men that they have been taught
14  therefore i am the one who will again do wonderful things with this peoplewith wonder upon wonderand the wisdom of their wise men will perishand the understanding of their discreet men will be hidden
15  woe to those who go to great lengths to conceal their plans from jehovah
their deeds are done in a dark placewhile they say who sees us who knows about us
16  how you twist things should the potter be regarded the same as the clay should what is made say about its maker he did not make me and does what is formed say about its former he shows no understanding
17  in just a short time lebʹanon will be turned into an orchardand the orchard will be regarded as a forest
18  in that day the deaf will hear the words of the bookand out of the gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see
19  the meek will rejoice greatly in jehovahand the poor among men will be joyful in the holy one of israel
20  for the tyrant will be no morethe boaster will come to his finishand all those keeping alert to do harm will be destroyed
21  those who with a false word make others guiltywho lay traps for the defender in the city gateand who with empty arguments deny justice to the righteous one
22  so this is what jehovah who redeemed abraham says to the house of jacob jacob will no longer be ashamedand no more will his face grow pale
23  for when he sees his childrenwho are the work of my hands in his midstthey will sanctify my nameyes they will sanctify the holy one of jacoband they will stand in awe of the god of israel
24  those who are wayward in spirit will acquire understandingand those who complain will accept instruction
40  comfort comfort my people says your god
2  speak to the heart of jerusalemand proclaim to her that her compulsory service has been fulfilledthat her guilt has been paid off
from the hand of jehovah she has received a full amount for all her sins
3  a voice of one calling out in the wilderness clear up the way of jehovah make a straight highway through the desert for our god
4  let every valley be raised upand every mountain and hill be made low
the rough ground must become leveland the rugged ground a valley plain
5  the glory of jehovah will be revealedand all flesh will see it togetherfor the mouth of jehovah has spoken
6  listen someone is saying call out another asks what should i call out all flesh is green grass
all their loyal love is like the blossom of the field
7  the green grass dries upthe blossom withersbecause the breath of jehovah blows upon it
surely the people are but green grass
8  the green grass dries upthe blossom withersbut the word of our god endures forever
9  go up onto a high mountainyou woman bringing good news for zion
raise your voice with poweryou woman bringing good news for jerusalem
raise it do not be afraid
announce to the cities of judah here is your god
10  look the sovereign lord jehovah will come with powerand his arm will rule for him
look his reward is with himand the wage he pays is before him
11  like a shepherd he will care for his flock
with his arm he will gather together the lambsand in his bosom he will carry them
he will gently lead those nursing their young
12  who has measured the waters in the hollow of his handand taken the measurements of the heavens with a span of his hand who has gathered in a measure the dust of the earthor weighed the mountains in the balancesand the hills in the scales
13  who has taken the measurements of the spirit of jehovahand who can instruct him as his adviser
14  with whom did he consult to gain understandingor who teaches him in the path of justiceor teaches him knowledgeor shows him the way of true understanding
15  look the nations are like a drop from a bucketand as the film of dust on the scales they are regarded
look he lifts up the islands like fine dust
16  even lebʹanon is not sufficient to keep a fire burningand its wild animals are not sufficient for a burnt offering
17  all the nations are as something nonexistent in front of himhe regards them as nothing as an unreality
18  to whom can you compare god what likeness can you put next to him
19  the craftsman casts an idolthe metalworker overlays it with goldand he forges silver chains
20  he chooses a tree for his contributiona tree that will not rot
he searches for a skilled craftsmanto prepare a carved image that will not topple over
21  do you not know have you not heard has it not been told to you from the beginning have you not understood from the foundations of the earth
22  there is one who dwells above the circle of the earthand its inhabitants are like grasshoppers
he is stretching out the heavens like a fine gauzeand he spreads them out like a tent to dwell in
23  he reduces high officials to nothingand makes the judges of the earth an unreality
24  they are hardly plantedthey are hardly sowntheir stem has hardly taken root in the earthand they are blown on and dry upand the wind carries them away like stubble
25  to whom can you liken me to make me his equal says the holy one
26  lift up your eyes to heaven and see
who has created these things it is the one who brings out their army by numberhe calls them all by name
because of his vast dynamic energy and his aweinspiring powernot one of them is missing
27  why do you say o jacob and why do you declare o israelmy way is hidden from jehovahand i receive no justice from god
28  do you not know have you not heard jehovah the creator of the ends of the earth is a god for all eternity
he never tires out or grows weary
his understanding is unsearchable
29  he gives power to the tired oneand full might to those lacking strength
30  boys will tire out and grow wearyand young men will stumble and fall
31  but those hoping in jehovah will regain power
they will soar on wings like eagles
they will run and not grow wearythey will walk and not tire out
60  arise o woman shed light for your light has come
the glory of jehovah shines on you
2  for look darkness will cover the earthand thick gloom the nationsbut on you jehovah will shineand on you his glory will be seen
3  nations will go to your lightand kings to your shining splendor
4  raise your eyes and look all around you they have all been assembled they are coming to you

5  at that time you will see and become radiantand your heart will throb and overflowbecause the wealth of the sea will be directed to youthe resources of the nations will come to you
6  throngs of camels will cover your landyoung male camels of midʹian and eʹphah

they will proclaim the praises of jehovah
7  all the flocks of keʹdar will be gathered to you
the rams of nebaʹioth will serve you
they will come on my altar with approvaland i will beautify my glorious house
8  who are these that fly along like cloudslike doves to their dovecotes
9  for in me the islands will hopethe ships of tarʹshish are in the leadto bring your sons from far awayalong with their silver and their goldto the name of jehovah your god and to the holy one of israelfor he will glorify you
10  foreigners will build your wallsand their kings will minister to youfor in my indignation i struck youbut in my favor i will have mercy on you
11  your gates will be kept open constantlythey will not be closed by day or by nightto bring to you the resources of the nationsand their kings will take the lead
12  for any nation and any kingdom that will not serve you will perishand the nations will be utterly devastated
13  to you the glory of lebʹanon will comethe juniper tree the ash tree and the cypress togetherto beautify the place of my sanctuaryi will glorify the place for my feet
14  the sons of those who oppressed you will come and bow down before youall those treating you disrespectfully must bow down at your feetand they will have to call you the city of jehovahzion of the holy one of israel
15  instead of your being abandoned and hated with nobody passing throughi will make you a source of everlasting pridea cause for rejoicing throughout all generations
16  and you will actually drink the milk of nationsat the breast of kings you will nurseand you will certainly know that i jehovah am your saviorand the powerful one of jacob is your repurchaser
17  instead of the copper i will bring in goldand instead of the iron i will bring in silverinstead of the wood copperand instead of the stones ironand i will appoint peace as your overseersand righteousness as your task assigners
18  no more will violence be heard in your landor destruction and ruin within your boundaries
and you will call your walls salvation and your gates praise
19  for you the sun will no longer be a light by daynor will the shining of the moon give you lightfor jehovah will become to you an eternal lightand your god will be your beauty

they are the sprout that i plantedthe work of my hands for me to be beautified
22  the little one will become a thousandand the small one a mighty nation
i myself jehovah will speed it up in its own time
53  who has put faith in the thing heard from us and as for the arm of jehovah to whom has it been revealed
2  he will come up like a twig before him like a root out of parched land
no stately form does he have nor any splendorand when we see him his appearance does not draw us to him
3  he was despised and was avoided by mena man who was meant for pains and was familiar with sickness
it was as if his face were hidden from us
he was despised and we held him as of no account
4  truly he himself carried our sicknessesand he bore our pains
but we considered him as plagued stricken by god and afflicted
5  but he was pierced for our transgressionhe was crushed for our errors
he bore the punishment for our peaceand because of his wounds we were healed
6  like sheep we have all wandered abouteach has turned his own wayand jehovah has caused the error of us all to meet up with him
7  he was oppressed and he let himself be afflictedbut he would not open his mouth
he was brought like a sheep to the slaughterlike a ewe that is silent before its shearersand he would not open his mouth
8  because of restraint and judgment he was taken awayand who will concern himself with the details of his generation for he was cut off from the land of the livingbecause of the transgression of my people he received the stroke
9  and he was given a burial place with the wickedand with the rich in his deathalthough he had done no wrongand there was no deception in his mouth
10  but it was jehovahs will to crush him and he let him become sick
if you will present his life as a guilt offeringhe will see his offspring he will prolong his daysand through him the delight of jehovah will have success
11  because of his anguish he will see and be satisfied
by means of his knowledge the righteous one my servantwill bring a righteous standing to many peopleand their errors he will bear
12  for that reason i will assign him a portion among the manyand he will apportion the spoil with the mightybecause he poured out his life even to deathand was counted among the transgressorshe carried the sin of many peopleand he interceded for the transgressors
39  at that time the king of babylon merʹodachbalʹadan son of balʹadan sent letters and a gift to hezekiʹah for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered
2  hezekiʹah gladly welcomed them and showed them his treasurehousethe silver the gold the balsam oil and other precious oil his whole armory and everything that was to be found in his treasuries
there was nothing that hezekiʹah did not show them in his own house and in all his dominion
3  after that isaiah the prophet came in to king hezekiʹah and asked him what did these men say and where did they come from so hezekiʹah said they came from a distant land from babylon
4  next he asked what did they see in your house hezekiʹah replied they saw everything in my house
there was nothing that i did not show them in my treasuries
5  isaiah now said to hezekiʹah hear the word of jehovah of armies
6  look days are coming and all that is in your house and all that your forefathers have stored up to this day will be carried off to babylon
nothing will be left says jehovah
7  and some of your own sons to whom you will become father will be taken and will become court officials in the palace of the king of babylon
8  at that hezekiʹah said to isaiah the word of jehovah that you have spoken is good
then he added because there will be peace and stability during my lifetime
56  this is what jehovah says uphold justice and do what is righteousfor my salvation will soon comeand my righteousness will be revealed
2  happy is the man who does thisand the son of man who holds fast to itwho keeps the sabbath and does not profane itand who holds his hand back from any kind of evil
3  the foreigner who joins himself to jehovah should not sayjehovah will surely separate me from his people
and the eunuch should not say look i am a driedup tree
4  for this is what jehovah says to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths and who choose what i delight in and who hold fast to my covenant
5  i will give to them in my house and within my walls a monument and a namesomething better than sons and daughters
an everlasting name i will give themone that will not perish
6  as for the foreigners who join themselves to jehovah to minister to himto love the name of jehovahand to be his servantsall those who keep the sabbath and do not profane itand who hold fast to my covenant
7  i will also bring them to my holy mountainand make them rejoice inside my house of prayer
their whole burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar
for my house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples
8  the sovereign lord jehovah who is gathering the dispersed ones of israel declares i will gather to him others besides those already gathered
9  all you wild animals of the field come to eatall you wild animals in the forest
10  his watchmen are blind none of them have taken note
all of them are speechless dogs unable to bark
they are panting and lying down they love to slumber
11  they are dogs with a voracious appetitethey are never satisfied
they are shepherds who have no understanding
they have all gone their own wayevery last one of them seeks his own dishonest gain and says
12  come let me take some wineand let us drink our fill of alcohol
and tomorrow will be like today only far better
19  a pronouncement against egypt look jehovah is riding on a swift cloud and is coming into egypt
the worthless gods of egypt will tremble before himand the heart of egypt will melt within it
2  i will incite egyptians against egyptiansand they will fight one anothereach against his brother and his neighborcity against city kingdom against kingdom
3  and the spirit of egypt will become bewildered within itand i will confuse its plans
they will resort to the worthless godsto the charmers and to the spirit mediums and to the fortunetellers
4  i will hand egypt over to a hard masterand a harsh king will rule over them declares the true lord jehovah of armies
5  the water of the sea will be dried upand the river will become parched and run dry
6  and the rivers will stinkthe nile canals of egypt will become low and parched
the reeds and the rushes will decay
7  the plants along the nile river at the mouth of the nileand all the land sown with seed along the nile will dry up
it will be blown away and it will be no more
8  and the fishermen will mournthose casting fishhooks into the nile will lamentand those who spread their nets on the water will dwindle
9  those who work in combed flaxand those making white fabric on the loom will be put to shame
10  her weavers will be crushedall the hired workers will grieve
11  the princes of zoʹan are foolish
the wisest advisers of pharʹaoh give unreasonable advice
how can you say to pharʹaoh i am a descendant of wise onesa descendant of ancient kings
12  where then are your wise men let them tell you if they know what jehovah of armies has decided concerning egypt
13  the princes of zoʹan have acted foolishlythe princes of noph have been deceivedthe chiefs of her tribes have led egypt astray
14  jehovah has poured out on her a spirit of confusionand they have led egypt astray in whatever she doeslike a drunk staggering in his vomit
15  and egypt will not have any work to dowhether for the head or the tail the shoot or the rush
16  in that day egypt will become like women trembling and terrified because of the threatening hand that jehovah of armies raises against it
17  and the land of judah will become a cause for terror to egypt
they will feel dread at the mention of it because of the decision that jehovah of armies has made against them
18  in that day there will be five cities in the land of egypt speaking the language of caʹnaan and swearing loyalty to jehovah of armies
one city will be called the city of tearing down
19  in that day there will be an altar to jehovah in the middle of the land of egypt and a pillar to jehovah at its boundary
20  it will be for a sign and for a witness to jehovah of armies in the land of egypt for they will cry out to jehovah because of the oppressors and he will send them a savior a grand one who will save them
21  and jehovah will become known to the egyptians and the egyptians will know jehovah in that day and they will offer sacrifices and gifts and make a vow to jehovah and pay it
22  jehovah will strike egypt striking and healing it and they will return to jehovah and he will respond to their entreaties and heal them
23  in that day there will be a highway out of egypt to assyrʹia
then assyrʹia will come into egypt and egypt into assyrʹia and egypt will serve god together with assyrʹia
24  in that day israel will be the third along with egypt and with assyrʹia a blessing in the midst of the earth
25  for jehovah of armies will have blessed it saying blessed be my people egypt and the work of my hands assyrʹia and my inheritance israel
24  look jehovah is emptying the land and making it desolate
he turns it upside down and scatters its inhabitants
2  it will be the same for everyone the people as well as the priestthe servant and his masterthe servant and her mistressthe buyer and the sellerthe lender and the borrowerthe creditor and the debtor
3  the land will be completely emptiedit will be completely plunderedfor jehovah has spoken this word
4  the land mourns it is wasting away
the productive land withers it is fading away
the prominent people of the land wither
5  the land has been polluted by its inhabitantsfor they have bypassed the lawschanged the regulationand broken the lasting covenant
6  that is why the curse devours the landand those inhabiting it are held guilty
that is why the inhabitants of the land have dwindledand very few men are left
7  the new wine mourns the vine withersand all those cheerful at heart are sighing
8  the joy of the tambourines has ceasedthe noise of the revelers has endedthe happy sound of the harp has ceased
9  they drink wine without songand alcohol tastes bitter to those drinking it
10  the deserted town is broken downevery house is shut up so that no one can enter
11  they cry out for wine in the streets
all rejoicing has disappearedthe joy of the land has gone
12  the city is left in ruinsthe gate has been crushed to a heap of rubble
13  for this is how it will be in the land among the peoples as when an olive tree is beatenlike the gleaning when the grape harvest comes to an end
14  they will raise their voicethey will shout joyfully
from the sea they will proclaim the majesty of jehovah
15  that is why they will glorify jehovah in the region of lightin the islands of the sea they will glorify the name of jehovah the god of israel
16  from the ends of the earth we hear songs glory to the righteous one but i say i am wasting away i am wasting away woe to me the treacherous have acted treacherouslywith treachery the treacherous have acted treacherously
17  terror and pits and traps await you inhabitant of the land
18  anyone fleeing from the sound of terror will fall into the pitand anyone coming up from the pit will be caught in the trap
for the floodgates above will be openedand the foundations of the land will quake
19  the land has burst apartthe land has been shaken upthe land convulses violently
20  the land staggers like a drunken manand it sways back and forth like a hut in the wind
its transgression weighs heavily on itand it will fall so that it will not rise up again
21  in that day jehovah will turn his attention to the army of the heights aboveand to the kings of the earth upon the earth
22  and they will be gathered togetherlike prisoners gathered into a pitand they will be shut up in the dungeonafter many days they will be given attention
23  the full moon will be abashedand the shining sun will be ashamedfor jehovah of armies has become king in mount zion and in jerusalemglorious before the elders of his people
58  call out fullthroated do not hold back raise your voice like a horn
proclaim to my people their revoltto the house of jacob their sins
2  they seek me day after dayand they express delight to know my waysas if they were a nation that had practiced righteousnessand had not abandoned the justice of their god
they ask me for righteous judgmentsdelighting to draw close to god
3  why do you not see when we fast and why do you not notice when we afflict ourselves because on the day of your fast you pursue your own interestsand you oppress your laborers
4  your fasting ends in quarrels and fightsand you strike with the fist of wickedness
you cannot fast as you do today and have your voice heard in heaven
5  should the fast that i choose be like thisas a day for someone to afflict himselfto bow down his head like a rushto make his bed on sackcloth and ashes is this what you call a fast and a day pleasing to jehovah
6  no this is the fast that i choose to remove the fetters of wickednessto untie the bands of the yoke barto let the oppressed go freeand to break in half every yoke bar
7  it is to share your bread with the hungryto bring the poor and homeless into your houseto clothe someone naked when you see himand not to turn your back on your own flesh
8  then your light will shine through like the dawnand your healing will spring up quickly
your righteousness will go before youand the glory of jehovah will be your rear guard
9  then you will call and jehovah will answeryou will cry for help and he will say here i am if you remove from among you the yoke barand stop pointing your finger and speaking maliciously
10  if you grant to the hungry what you yourself desireand satisfy those who are afflictedthen your light will shine even in the darknessand your gloom will be like midday
11  jehovah will always lead youand satisfy you even in a parched landhe will invigorate your bonesand you will become like a wellwatered gardenlike a spring whose waters never fail
12  they will rebuild ancient ruins on your accountand you will restore the foundations of past generations
you will be called the repairer of the broken wallsthe restorer of roadways by which to dwell
13  if because of the sabbath you refrain from pursuing your own interests on my holy dayand you call the sabbath an exquisite delight a holy day of jehovah a day to be glorifiedand you glorify it rather than pursuing your own interests and speaking idle words
14  then you will find your exquisite delight in jehovahand i will make you ride on the high places of the earth
i will cause you to eat from the inheritance of jacob your forefatherfor the mouth of jehovah has spoken
43  now this is what jehovah saysyour creator o jacob the one who formed you o israel do not be afraid for i have repurchased you
i have called you by your name
you belong to me
2  when you pass through the waters i will be with youand through the rivers they will not flood over you
when you walk through the fire you will not be scorchednor will the flame singe you
3  for i am jehovah your godthe holy one of israel your savior
i have given egypt as a ransom for youethioʹpia and seʹba in exchange for you
4  for you became precious in my eyesyou were honored and i have loved you
so i will give people in place of youand nations in exchange for your life
5  do not be afraid for i am with you
i will bring your offspring from the eastand gather you together from the west
6  i will say to the north give them up and to the south do not hold them back
bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth
7  everyone who is called by my nameand whom i created for my own glorywhom i have formed and made
8  bring out a people who are blind though they have eyesand who are deaf though they have ears
9  let all the nations assemble in one placeand let the peoples be gathered together
who among them can tell this or can they cause us to hear the first things let them present their witnesses to prove themselves rightor let them hear and say it is the truth
10  you are my witnesses declares jehovahyes my servant whom i have chosenso that you may know and have faith in meand understand that i am the same one
before me no god was formedand after me there has been none
11  ii am jehovah and besides me there is no savior
12  i am the one who declared and saved and made knownwhen there was no foreign god among you
so you are my witnesses declares jehovah and i am god
13  also i am always the same oneand no one can snatch anything out of my hand
when i act who can prevent it
14  this is what jehovah says your repurchaser the holy one of israel for your sakes i will send to babylon and bring down all the bars of the gatesand the chaldeʹans in their ships will cry out in distress
15  i am jehovah your holy one the creator of israel your king
16  this is what jehovah saysthe one making a way through the seaand a path even through turbulent waters
17  the one who draws out the war chariot and the horsethe army together with the mighty warriors they will lie down and not get up
they will be extinguished snuffed out like a burning wick
18  do not remember the former thingsand do not dwell on the past
19  look i am doing something neweven now it is springing up
do you not recognize it i will make a way through the wildernessand rivers through the desert
20  the wild beast of the field will honor methe jackals and the ostrichesfor i provide water in the wildernessrivers in the desertfor my people my chosen one to drink
21  the people whom i formed for myselfso that they might declare my praise
22  but you have not called on me o jacobbecause you grew weary of me o israel
23  you have not brought me sheep for your whole burnt offeringsor glorified me with your sacrifices
i have not compelled you to bring me a giftnor have i made you weary by demanding frankincense
24  you did not buy me sweet cane with your moneyand with the fat of your sacrifices you did not satisfy me
instead you have burdened me with your sinsand made me weary with your errors
25  i i am the one who is blotting out your transgressions for my own sakeand i will not remember your sins
26  remind me let us bring our case against each othertell your side of it to prove you are in the right
27  your first forefather sinnedand your own spokesmen have rebelled against me
28  so i will profane the princes of the holy placeand i will give jacob over to destructionand subject israel to insulting words
66  this is what jehovah says the heavens are my throne and the earth is my footstool
where then is the house that you could build for meand where is my restingplace
2  my own hand has made all these thingsand this is how they all came to be declares jehovah
to this one then i will lookto the one humble and broken in spirit who trembles at my word
3  the one slaughtering the bull is like one striking down a man
the one sacrificing a sheep is like one breaking the neck of a dog
the one offering a giftlike the blood of a pig the one presenting a memorial offering of frankincense is like one saying a blessing with magical words
they have chosen their own waysand they take delight in what is disgusting
4  so i will choose ways to punish themand the very things they dread i will bring upon them
because when i called no one answeredwhen i spoke there were none who listened
they kept doing what was bad in my eyesand they chose to do what displeased me
5  hear the word of jehovah you who tremble at his word your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of my name said may jehovah be glorified but he will appear and bring you joyand they are the ones who will be put to shame
6  there is a sound of uproar from the city a sound from the temple it is the sound of jehovah repaying his enemies what they deserve
7  before she went into labor she gave birth
before birth pangs came to her she delivered a male child
8  who has ever heard of such a thing who has seen such things will a land be brought to birth in one day or will a nation be born all at once yet as soon as zion went into labor she gave birth to her sons
9  will i bring it to the point of birth and then not bring it forth says jehovah
or would i cause the birth and then shut the womb says your god
10  rejoice with jerusalem and be joyful with her all you who love her
exult greatly with her all you who are in mourning over her
11  for you will nurse and be fully satisfied from her breast of consolationand you will drink deeply and find delight in the abundance of her glory
12  for this is what jehovah says here i am extending to her peace just like a riverand the glory of nations like a flooding torrent
you will nurse and be carried on the hipand you will be bounced on the knees
13  as a mother comforts her sonso i will keep comforting youand over jerusalem you will be comforted
14  you will see this and your heart will rejoiceyour bones will flourish just like new grass
and the hand of jehovah will become known to his servantsbut he will denounce his enemies
15  for jehovah will come as a fireand his chariots are like a storm windto repay in furious angerto rebuke with flames of fire
16  for with fire jehovah will execute judgmentyes with his sword against all fleshand the slain of jehovah will be many
17  those sanctifying themselves and cleansing themselves to enter the gardens following one who is in the center those eating the flesh of pigs and loathsome things and mice they will all come to their end together declares jehovah
18  since i know about their works and their thoughts i am coming to gather people of all nations and languages and they will come and see my glory
19  i will set a sign among them and i will send some of those who escape to the nationsto tarʹshish pul and lud those who draw the bow to tuʹbal and jaʹvan and to the faraway islandswho have not heard a report about me or seen my glory and they will proclaim my glory among the nations
20  they will bring all your brothers out of all the nations as a gift to jehovah on horses in chariots in covered wagons on mules and on swift camels up to my holy mountain jerusalem says jehovah just as when the people of israel bring their gift in a clean vessel into the house of jehovah
21  i will also take some for the priests and for the levites says jehovah
22  for just as the new heavens and the new earth that i am making will remain standing before me declares jehovah so your offspring and your name will remain
23  and from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbathall flesh will come in to bow down before me says jehovah
24  and they will go out and look on the carcasses of the men who rebelled against mefor the worms on them will not dieand their fire will not be extinguishedand they will become something repulsive to all people
54  shout joyfully you barren woman who has not given birth become cheerful and cry out for joy you who never had birth painsfor the sons of the desolate one are more numerousthan the sons of the woman with a husband says jehovah
2  make the place of your tent more spacious
stretch out the tent cloths of your grand tabernacle
do not hold back lengthen your tent cordsand make your tent pins strong
3  for you will spread out to the right and to the left
your offspring will take possession of nationsand they will inhabit the desolated cities
4  do not be afraid for you will not be put to shameand do not feel humiliated for you will not be disappointed
for you will forget the shame of your youthand the disgrace of your widowhood you will remember no more
5  for your grand maker is as your husbandjehovah of armies is his nameand the holy one of israel is your repurchaser
he will be called the god of the whole earth
6  for jehovah called you as if you were an abandoned wife and griefstrickenlike a wife married in youth and then rejected says your god
7  for a brief moment i abandoned youbut with great mercy i will gather you back
8  in a flood of indignation i hid my face from you for a momentbut with everlasting loyal love i will have mercy on you says your repurchaser jehovah
9  this is like the days of noah to me
just as i have sworn that the waters of noah will no more cover the earthso i swear that i will no more become indignant toward you or rebuke you
10  for the mountains may be removedand the hills may be shakenbut my loyal love will not be removed from younor will my covenant of peace be shaken says jehovah the one having mercy on you
11  o afflicted woman stormtossed uncomfortedi am laying your stones with hard mortarand your foundation with sapphires
12  i will make your battlements of rubiesyour gates of sparkling stonesand all your boundaries of precious stones
13  and all your sons will be taught by jehovahand the peace of your sons will be abundant
14  you will be firmly established in righteousness
you will be far removed from oppressionyou will fear nothing and have no cause for terrorfor it will not come near you
15  if anyone should attack youit will not be at my orders
whoever makes an attack on you will fall because of you
16  look i myself created the craftsmanwho blows on the charcoal fireand his work produces a weapon
i myself also created the destructive man to bring ruin
17  no weapon formed against you will have any successand you will condemn any tongue that rises up against you in the judgment
this is the heritage of the servants of jehovahand their righteousness is from me declares jehovah
44  now listen o jacob my servantand you o israel whom i have chosen
2  this is what jehovah saysyour maker and the one who formed youwho has helped you from the womb do not be afraid my servant jacoband you jeshʹurun whom i have chosen
3  for i will pour out water on the thirsty oneand flowing streams on the dry ground
i will pour out my spirit on your offspringand my blessing on your descendants
4  and they will spring up as among the green grasslike poplars by the streams of water
5  one will say i belong to jehovah
another will call himself by the name of jacoband yet another will write on his hand belonging to jehovah
and he will adopt the name of israel
6  this is what jehovah saysthe king of israel and his repurchaser jehovah of armies i am the first and i am the last
there is no god but me
7  who is there like me let him call out and tell it and prove it to me from the time i established the people of long agolet them tell both the things to comeand what will yet happen
8  do not be in dreadand do not become paralyzed with fear
have i not told each of you beforehand and declared it you are my witnesses
is there any god but me no there is no other rock i know of none
9  all who form carved images amount to nothingand their cherished objects will be of no benefit
as their witnesses they see nothing and know nothingso those who made them will be put to shame
10  who would form a god or cast a metal imagethat can bring no benefit
11  look all his associates will be put to shame the craftsmen are mere humans
let them all assemble and take their stand
they will be terrified and be put to shame together
12  the metalsmith works the iron over the coals with his tool
he forms it with hammersworking it with his powerful arm
then he grows hungry and his strength failshe drinks no water and grows tired
13  the woodcarver stretches the measuring line tracing out the pattern with red chalk
he works it with a wood scraper and traces it with a compass
he patterns it after a manwith the beauty of a manto sit in a house
14  there is one whose work is to cut down cedars
he selects a certain type of tree an oakand he lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest
he plants a laurel tree and the rain makes it grow
15  then it becomes fuel for a man to make fires
he takes part of it to warm himselfhe builds a fire and bakes bread
but he also makes a god and worships it
he makes it into a carved image and he bows down before it
16  half of it he burns up in a firewith that half he roasts the meat that he eats and he is satisfied
he also warms himself and says ah i am warm as i watch the fire
17  but the rest of it he makes into a god into his carved image
he bows down to it and worships it
he prays to it and says save me for you are my god
18  they know nothing they understand nothingbecause their eyes are sealed shut and they cannot seeand their heart has no insight
19  no one reflects in his heartor has knowledge or understanding saying half of it i burned up in a fireand on its coals i baked bread and roasted meat to eat
should i then make the rest of it into a detestable thing should i worship a block of wood from a tree
20  he feeds on ashes
his own deluded heart has led him astray
he cannot save himself nor does he say is there not a lie in my right hand
21  remember these things o jacob and you o israelfor you are my servant
i formed you and you are my servant
o israel i will not forget you
22  i will blot out your transgressions as with a cloudand your sins as with a thick cloud
return to me for i will repurchase you
23  shout joyfully you heavensfor jehovah has acted shout in triumph you depths of the earth shout for joy you mountainsyou forest and all your trees for jehovah has repurchased jacoband on israel he displays his splendor
24  this is what jehovah says your repurchaserwho formed you since you were in the womb i am jehovah who made everything
i stretched out the heavens by myselfand i spread out the earth
who was with me
25  i am frustrating the signs of the empty talkersand i am the one who makes diviners act like foolsthe one confounding the wise menand turning their knowledge into foolishness
26  the one making the word of his servant come trueand completely fulfilling the predictions of his messengersthe one saying of jerusalem she will be inhabited and of the cities of judah they will be rebuiltand i will restore her ruins
27  the one saying to the deep waters be evaporatedand i will dry up all your rivers
28  the one saying of cyrus he is my shepherdand he will completely carry out all my willthe one saying of jerusalem she will be rebuilt and of the temple your foundation will be laid
47  come down and sit in the dusto virgin daughter of babylon
sit down on the ground where there is no throneo daughter of the chaldeʹansfor never again will people call you delicate and pampered
2  take a hand mill and grind flour
remove your veil
strip off your skirt uncover your legs
cross over the rivers
3  your nakedness will be uncovered
your shame will be exposed
i will take vengeance and no man will stand in my way
4  the one repurchasing usjehovah of armies is his nameis the holy one of israel
5  sit there silently and go into darknesso daughter of the chaldeʹansno more will they call you mistress of kingdoms
6  i grew indignant at my people
i profaned my inheritanceand i gave them into your hand
but you showed them no mercy
even on the elderly you placed a heavy yoke
7  you said i will always be the mistress forever
you did not take these things to heartyou did not consider how the matter would end
8  now hear this o lover of pleasurewho sits in security who says in her heart i am the one and there is no one else
i will not become a widow
i will never know the loss of children
9  but these two things will come upon you suddenly in one day loss of children and widowhood
in full measure they will come upon youbecause of your many sorceries and all your powerful spells
10  you trusted in your wickedness
you said no one sees me
your wisdom and knowledge are what led you astrayand you say in your heart i am the one and there is no one else
11  but calamity will come upon youand none of your charms will stop it
adversity will befall you you will not be able to avert it
sudden ruin will come upon you like you have never known
12  go ahead then with your spells and your many sorcerieswith which you have toiled from your youth
perhaps you may be able to benefitperhaps you may strike people with awe
13  you have grown weary with the multitude of your advisers
let them stand up now and save youthose who worship the heavens who gaze at the starsthose giving out knowledge at the new moonsabout the things that will come upon you
14  look they are like stubble
a fire will burn them up
they cannot save themselves from the power of the flame
these are not charcoals for keeping warmand this is not a fire to sit in front of
15  so your charmers will become to youthose with whom you toiled from your youth
they will wander each one in his own direction
there will be no one to save you
48  hear this o house of jacobyou who call yourselves by the name of israeland who have come from the waters of judahyou who swear by the name of jehovahand who call on the god of israelthough not in truth and righteousness
2  for they call themselves after the holy cityand seek the support of the god of israelwhose name is jehovah of armies
3  the former things i told you long ago
from my own mouth they went outand i made them known
suddenly i took action and they came about
4  because i knew how stubborn you arethat your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead is copper
5  i told you long ago
before it came about i caused you to hear itso that you could not say my idol did thismy carved image and my metal image commanded this
6  you have heard and seen all of this
will you not declare it from now on i am announcing new things to youguarded secrets that you have not known
7  only now are they being created and not long agothings that you never heard before todayso that you cannot say look i already know them
8  no you have not heard you have not knownand in the past your ears were not opened
for i know that you are very treacherousand you have been called a transgressor from birth
9  but for the sake of my name i will hold back my angerfor my own praise i will restrain myself toward youand i will not do away with you
10  look i have refined you but not in the form of silver
i have tested you in the smelting furnace of affliction
11  for my own sake for my own sake i will actfor how could i let myself be profaned i give my glory to no one else
12  listen to me o jacob and israel whom i have called
i am the same one
i am the first i am also the last
13  my own hand laid the foundation of the earthand my right hand spread out the heavens
when i call to them they stand up together
14  gather together all of you and listen
who among them has announced these things jehovah has loved him
he will carry out his delight against babylonand his arm will come against the chaldeʹans
15  i myself have spoken and i have called him
i have brought him and his way will be successful
16  come near to me and hear this
from the very start i have not spoken in secret
from the time it happened i was there
and now the sovereign lord jehovah has sent me and his spirit
17  this is what jehovah says your repurchaser the holy one of israel i jehovah am your godthe one teaching you to benefit yourselfthe one guiding you in the way you should walk
18  if only you would pay attention to my commandments then your peace would become just like a riverand your righteousness like the waves of the sea
19  your offspring would be as many as the sandand your descendants as its grains
their name would never be cut off or annihilated from before me
20  go out from babylon flee from the chaldeʹans announce it with a joyful cry proclaim it make it known to the ends of the earth
say jehovah has repurchased his servant jacob
21  they did not become thirsty when he led them through devastated places
he caused water to flow out of the rock for themhe split a rock and made water gush out
22  there is no peace says jehovah for the wicked
59  look the hand of jehovah is not too short to savenor is his ear too dull to hear
2  no your own errors have separated you from your god
your sins have made him hide his face from youand he refuses to hear you
3  for your palms are polluted with bloodand your fingers with error
your lips speak lies and your tongue mutters unrighteousness
4  no one calls out for righteousnessand no one goes to court in truthfulness
they trust in unreality and speak what is worthless
they conceive trouble and give birth to what is harmful
5  they hatch the eggs of a poisonous snakeand they weave the cobweb of a spider
anyone who eats their eggs would dieand the egg that is crushed hatches a viper
6  their cobweb will not serve as a garmentnor will they cover themselves with what they make
their works are harmfuland deeds of violence are in their hands
7  their feet run to do eviland they hurry to shed innocent blood
their thoughts are harmful thoughtsruin and misery are in their ways
8  they have not known the way of peaceand there is no justice in their tracks
they make their roadways crookedno one treading on them will know peace
9  that is why justice is far away from usand righteousness does not overtake us
we keep hoping for light but look there is darknessfor brightness but we keep walking in gloom
10  we grope for the wall like blind menlike those without eyes we keep groping
we stumble at high noon as in evening darknessamong the strong we are just like the dead
11  we all keep growling like bearsand cooing mournfully like doves
we hope for justice but there is nonefor salvation but it is far away from us
12  for our revolts are many before youeach of our sins testifies against us
for our revolts are with uswe well know our errors
13  we have transgressed and denied jehovahwe have turned our backs on our god
we have spoken of oppression and revoltwe have conceived lies and muttered false words from the heart
14  justice is driven backand righteousness stands far offfor truth has stumbled in the public squareand what is upright is unable to enter
15  truth has vanishedand anyone who turns away from bad is plundered
jehovah saw this and was displeasedfor there was no justice
16  he saw that there was no manand he was astonished that no one intercededso his own arm brought about salvationand his own righteousness supported him
17  then he put on righteousness like a coat of mailand the helmet of salvation on his head
he put on the garments of vengeance as his clothingand wrapped himself with zeal like a coat
18  he will reward them for what they have done wrath to his adversaries retribution to his enemies
and to the islands he will repay their due
19  from the sunset they will fear the name of jehovahand from the sunrise his gloryfor he will come in like a rushing riverwhich the spirit of jehovah drives along
20  to zion the repurchaser will cometo those in jacob who turn from transgression declares jehovah
21  as for me this is my covenant with them says jehovah
my spirit that is on you and my words that i have placed in your mouththey will not be removed from your mouth from the mouth of your children or from the mouth of your grandchildren says jehovah from now on and forever
5  let me sing please to my beloveda song about my loved one and his vineyard
my beloved had a vineyard on a fruitful hillside
2  he dug it up and rid it of stones
he planted it with a choice red vinebuilt a tower in the middle of itand hewed out a winepress in it
then he kept hoping for it to produce grapesbut it produced only wild grapes
3  and now you inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judahplease judge between me and my vineyard
4  what more could i have done for my vineyardthat i have not already done why when i hoped for grapesdid it produce only wild grapes
5  now please let me tell youwhat i will do to my vineyard i will remove its hedgeand it will be burned down
i will break down its stone walland it will be trampled on
6  i will make it a wastelandit will not be pruned or hoed
it will be overgrown with thornbushes and weedsand i will command the clouds not to send any rain on it
7  for the vineyard of jehovah of armies is the house of israelthe men of judah are the plantation he was fond of
he kept hoping for justicebut look there was injusticefor righteousnessbut look a cry of distress
8  woe to those who join one house to another houseand who annex one field to another fielduntil there is no more roomand you live by yourselves on the land
9  jehovah of armies has sworn in my earsthat many houses though great and beautifulwill become an object of horrorwithout an inhabitant
10  for ten acres of vineyard will produce but one bath measureand a hoʹmer measure of seed will produce only an eʹphah
11  woe to those who get up early in the morning to drink alcoholwho linger late into the evening darkness until wine inflames them
12  they have harp and stringed instrumenttambourine flute and wine at their feastsbut they do not consider the activity of jehovahand they do not see the work of his hands
13  so my people will go into exilefor lack of knowledgetheir glorious men will go hungryand all their people will be parched with thirst
14  so the grave has enlarged itselfand has opened its mouth wide without limitand her splendor her noisy multitudes and her revelerswill certainly go down into it
15  and man will bow downman will be brought lowand the eyes of the haughty will be brought low
16  jehovah of armies will be exalted by his judgmentthe true god the holy one will sanctify himself through righteousness
17  and the lambs will graze as in their pastureforeign residents will feed on the desolate places of wellfed animals
18  woe to those who drag along their guilt with ropes of deceptionand their sin with wagon cords
19  those who say let him speed up his worklet it come quickly that we may see it
let the purpose of the holy one of israel take placethat we may know it
20  woe to those who say that good is bad and bad is goodthose who substitute darkness for light and light for darknessthose who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter
21  woe to those wise in their own eyesand discreet in their own sight
22  woe to those who are mighty in drinking wineand to the men who are masters at mixing alcoholic drinks
23  those who acquit the wicked for a bribeand who deny justice to the righteous
24  therefore just as the tongue of fire consumes the stubbleand dry grass shrivels in the flamestheir very roots will rotand their blossoms will scatter like powderbecause they rejected the law of jehovah of armiesand disrespected the word of the holy one of israel
25  that is why the anger of jehovah burns against his peopleand he will stretch out his hand against them and strike them
the mountains will quakeand their corpses will be like refuse in the streets
in view of all this his anger has not turned backbut his hand is still stretched out to strike
26  he has raised up a signal to a distant nationhe has whistled for them to come from the ends of the earthand look they are coming very swiftly
27  none among them are tired or stumbling
no one is drowsy or sleeps
the belt around their waist is not loosenednor are their sandal laces broken
28  all their arrows are sharpand all their bows are bent
the hooves of their horses are like flintand their wheels like a storm wind
29  their roaring is like that of a lionthey roar like young lions
they will growl and seize the preyand carry it off with no one to rescue it
30  in that day they will growl over itlike the growling of the sea
anyone who gazes at the land will see distressing darknesseven the light has grown dark because of the clouds
36  in the 14th year of king hezekiʹah sennachʹerib the king of assyrʹia came up against all the fortified cities of judah and captured them
2  the king of assyrʹia then sent the rabʹshakeh with a vast army from laʹchish to king hezekiʹah in jerusalem
they took up a position by the conduit of the upper pool which is at the highway of the laundrymans field
3  then eliʹakim son of hilkiʹah who was in charge of the household shebʹna the secretary and joʹah son of aʹsaph the recorder came out to him
4  so the rabʹshakeh said to them please say to hezekiʹah this is what the great king the king of assyrʹia says what is the basis for your confidence
5  you are saying i have a strategy and the power to wage war but these are empty words
in whom have you put trust so that you dare to rebel against me
6  look you trust in the support of this crushed reed egypt which if a man should lean on it would enter into his palm and pierce it
that is the way pharʹaoh king of egypt is to all those who trust in him
7  and if you should say to me we trust in jehovah our god is he not the one whose high places and altars hezekiʹah has removed while he says to judah and jerusalem you should bow down before this altar
8  so now make this wager please with my lord the king of assyrʹia i will give you 2000 horses if you are able to find enough riders for them
9  how then could you drive back even one governor who is the least of my lords servants while you put your trust in egypt for chariots and for horsemen
10  now is it without authorization from jehovah that i have come up against this land to destroy it jehovah himself said to me go up against this land and destroy it
11  at this eliʹakim and shebʹna and joʹah said to the rabʹshakeh speak to your servants please in the aramaʹic language for we can understand it do not speak to us in the language of the jews in the hearing of the people on the wall
12  but the rabʹshakeh said is it just to your lord and to you that my lord sent me to speak these words is it not also to the men who sit on the wall those who will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you
13  then the rabʹshakeh stood and called out loudly in the language of the jews saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyrʹia
14  this is what the king says do not let hezekiʹah deceive you for he is not able to rescue you
15  and do not let hezekiʹah cause you to trust in jehovah by saying jehovah will surely rescue us and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of assyrʹia
16  do not listen to hezekiʹah for this is what the king of assyrʹia says make peace with me and surrender and each of you will eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree and will drink the water of his own cistern
17  until i come and take you to a land like your own land a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards
18  do not let hezekiʹah mislead you by saying jehovah will rescue us
have any of the gods of the nations rescued their land out of the hand of the king of assyrʹia
19  where are the gods of haʹmath and arʹpad where are the gods of sepharvaʹim and have they rescued samarʹia out of my hand
20  who among all the gods of these lands have rescued their land out of my hand so that jehovah should rescue jerusalem out of my hand
21  but they kept silent and did not say a word to him in reply for the order of the king was you must not answer him
22  but eliʹakim son of hilkiʹah who was in charge of the household shebʹna the secretary and joʹah son of aʹsaph the recorder came to hezekiʹah with their garments ripped apart and told him the words of the rabʹshakeh
61  the spirit of the sovereign lord jehovah is upon mebecause jehovah anointed me to declare good news to the meek
he sent me to bind up the brokenheartedto proclaim liberty to the captivesand the wide opening of the eyes to the prisoners
2  to proclaim the year of jehovahs goodwilland the day of vengeance of our godto comfort all who mourn
3  to provide for those mourning over zionto give them a headdress instead of ashesthe oil of exultation instead of mourningthe garment of praise instead of a despondent spirit
and they will be called big trees of righteousnessthe planting of jehovah in order to glorify him
4  they will rebuild the ancient ruinsthey will raise up the desolated places of the pastand they will restore the devastated citiesthe places that lay desolate for generation after generation
5  strangers will stand and shepherd your flocksand foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers
6  as for you you will be called the priests of jehovahthey will call you the ministers of our god
you will eat the resources of the nationsand about their glory you will boast
7  instead of shame you will have a double portionand instead of humiliation they will shout joyfully over their share
yes they will possess a double portion in their land
everlasting rejoicing will be theirs
8  for i jehovah love justicei hate robbery and unrighteousness
i will faithfully give them their wagesand i will make an everlasting covenant with them
9  their offspring will be known among the nationsand their descendants among the peoples
all who see them will recognize themthat they are the offspring whom jehovah has blessed
10  i will greatly exult in jehovah
my whole being will rejoice in my god
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvationhe has wrapped me with the robe of righteousnessjust like a bridegroom who wears a turban like that of a priestand like a bride who adorns herself with her ornaments
11  for as the earth brings forth its sproutsand as the garden makes what is sown in it sproutso will the sovereign lord jehovahcause righteousness and praise to sprout before all the nations
41  listen to me in silence you islandslet the nations regain their strength
let them approach then let them speak
let us come together for judgment
2  who has raised up someone from the sunrisecalling him in righteousness to his feetto hand over nations to himand to make him subdue kings who reduces them to dust before his swordlike windblown stubble before his bow
3  he pursues them passing along unhinderedover paths that his feet have not traveled
4  who has acted and done thissummoning the generations from the beginning i jehovah am the first oneand with the last ones i am the same
5  the islands have seen it and have become afraid
the ends of the earth began to tremble
they draw near and come forward
6  each one helps his companionand says to his brother be strong
7  so the craftsman strengthens the metalworkerthe one who flattens with the forge hammerstrengthens the one hammering at the anvil
he says about the soldering it is good
then it is fastened with nails so that it will not topple over
8  but you o israel are my servantyou o jacob whom i have chosenthe offspring of abraham my friend
9  you whom i took from the ends of the earthand you whom i called from its most distant parts
i said to you you are my servanti have chosen you i have not rejected you
10  do not be afraid for i am with you
do not be anxious for i am your god
i will fortify you yes i will help youi will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness
11  look all those getting enraged against you will be put to shame and humiliated
those who fight with you will be brought to nothing and perish
12  you will search for men who struggle with you but you will not find themthe men at war with you will become as something nonexistent as nothing at all
13  for i jehovah your god am grasping your right handthe one saying to you do not be afraid
i will help you
14  do not be afraid you worm jacobyou men of israel i will help you declares jehovah your repurchaser the holy one of israel
15  look i have made you a threshing sledgea new threshing instrument with doubleedged teeth
you will tread down the mountains and crush themand make the hills like chaff
16  you will winnow themand the wind will carry them awaya windstorm will scatter them
you will be joyful in jehovahand you will boast in the holy one of israel
17  the needy and the poor are seeking water but there is none
their tongue is dry from thirst
i jehovah will answer them
i the god of israel will not abandon them
18  i will make rivers flow on the bare hillsand springs in the valley plains
i will turn the wilderness into a reedy pool of waterand the waterless land into springs of water
19  in the desert i will plant the cedar treethe acacia and the myrtle and the pine tree
in the desert plain i will plant the juniper treetogether with the ash and the cypress tree
20  so that all people may see and knowand pay attention and understandthat the hand of jehovah has done thisand the holy one of israel has created it
21  present your case says jehovah
produce your arguments says the king of jacob
22  produce evidence and tell us the things that will happen
do tell us about the former thingsso that we may reflect on them and know their outcome
or declare to us the things that are coming
23  tell us what will happen in the futureso that we may know that you are gods
yes do something good or badso that we may be amazed when we see it
24  look you are something nonexistentand your achievement is nothing
anyone who chooses you is detestable
25  i have raised up someone from the north and he will comeone from the rising of the sun who will call on my name
he will trample rulers as if they were claylike a potter who treads moist clay
26  who told about this from the beginning so that we could knowor from times past so that we could say he is right indeed no one announced it no one declared it no one heard anything from you
27  i was the first to say to zion look here they are and to jerusalem i will send a bearer of good news
28  but i kept looking and there was no onethere was not one among them to give advice
and i kept asking them to reply
29  look all of them are a delusion
their works are nothing
their metal images are wind and unreality
15  a pronouncement against moʹab because it has been devastated in a nightar of moʹab has been silenced
because it has been devastated in a nightkir of moʹab has been silenced
2  he has gone up to the house and to diʹbonto the high places to weep
moʹab wails over neʹbo and over medʹeba
every head is shaved bald every beard is clipped
3  in its streets they have put on sackcloth
on their roofs and in their public squares they all wailthey go down weeping
4  heshʹbon and eleaʹleh cry outtheir voice is heard as far as jaʹhaz
that is why the armed men of moʹab keep shouting
he is trembling
5  my heart cries out over moʹab
its fugitives have fled as far as zoʹar and egʹlathsheliʹshiyah
on the ascent of luʹhith they weep as they go upon the way to horonaʹim they cry out over the catastrophe
6  for the waters of nimʹrim are desolatethe green grass has dried upthe grass is gone and nothing green is left
7  that is why they are carrying away what is left of their stores and their richesthey are crossing the valley of poplars
8  for the outcry echoes throughout the territory of moʹab
the wailing reaches to eglaʹimthe wailing reaches to beʹereʹlim
9  for the waters of diʹmon are full of bloodand i have more in store for diʹmon a lion for those of moʹab who escapeand for those remaining in the land
20  in the year that king sarʹgon of assyrʹia sent the tarʹtan to ashʹdod he fought against ashʹdod and captured it
2  at that time jehovah spoke through isaiah the son of aʹmoz saying go remove the sackcloth from your hips and take your sandals off your feet
and he did so walking about naked and barefoot
3  jehovah then said just as my servant isaiah has walked about naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against egypt and ethioʹpia
4  so the king of assyrʹia will lead the captives of egypt and the exiles of ethioʹpia boys and old men naked and barefoot and with exposed buttocks the nakedness of egypt
5  and they will be terrified and will be ashamed of ethioʹpia their hope and of egypt their pride
6  the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day look at what happened to our hope to which we fled for help and rescue from the king of assyrʹia how will we escape now
1  the vision that isaiah the son of aʹmoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziʹah joʹtham aʹhaz and hezekiʹah kings of judah
2  hear o heavens and pay attention o earthfor jehovah has spoken sons i have brought up and raisedbut they have revolted against me
3  a bull well knows its buyerand a donkey the manger of its ownerbut israel does not know memy own people do not behave with understanding
4  woe to the sinful nationthe people weighed down with errora brood of wicked men corrupt children they have abandoned jehovahthey have treated the holy one of israel with disrespectthey have turned their backs on him
5  where will you be struck next as you add to your rebellion the whole head is sickand the whole heart is diseased
6  from the sole of the foot to the head nothing is healthy
there are wounds and bruises and open soresthey have not been treated or bound up or softened with oil
7  your land is desolate
your cities are burned with fire
foreigners devour your land right in front of you
it is like a wasteland overthrown by foreigners
8  the daughter of zion has been left like a shelter in a vineyardlike a hut in a cucumber fieldlike a city under siege
9  unless jehovah of armies had left us a few survivorswe should have become just like sodʹomand we should have resembled gomorʹrah
10  hear the word of jehovah you dictators of sodʹom
pay attention to the law of our god you people of gomorʹrah
11  of what benefit to me are your many sacrifices says jehovah
i have had enough of your burnt offerings of rams and the fat of wellfed animalsand i have no delight in the blood of young bulls and lambs and goats
12  when you come to appear before mewho has required this from youthis trampling of my courtyards
13  stop bringing in any more worthless grain offerings
your incense is detestable to me
new moons sabbaths the calling of conventionsi cannot put up with the use of magical power along with your solemn assembly
14  i have hated your new moons and your festivals
they have become a burden to mei am tired of bearing them
15  and when you spread out your palmsi hide my eyes from you
although you offer many prayersi am not listeningyour hands are filled with blood
16  wash yourselves make yourselves cleanremove your evil deeds from my sightstop doing bad
17  learn to do good seek justicecorrect the oppressordefend the rights of the fatherless childand plead the cause of the widow
18  come now and let us set matters straight between us says jehovah
though your sins are like scarletthey will be made as white as snowthough they are as red as crimson cloththey will become like wool
19  if you show willingness and listenyou will eat the good things of the land
20  but if you refuse and rebelyou will be devoured by the swordfor the mouth of jehovah has spoken it
21  how the faithful city has become a prostitute she was full of justicerighteousness used to lodge in herbut now murderers
22  your silver has become drossand your beer is diluted with water
23  your princes are stubborn and partners with thieves
every one of them loves a bribe and chases after gifts
they do not grant justice to the fatherlessand the legal case of the widow never reaches them
24  therefore the true lord jehovah of armiesthe powerful one of israel declares ah i will rid myself of my adversariesand i will take revenge on my enemies
25  i will turn my hand against youi will smelt away your dross as with lyeand i will remove all your impurities
26  i will restore your judges as in the beginningand your advisers as at the start
after this you will be called city of righteousness faithful town
27  with justice zion will be redeemedand her people who return with righteousness
28  the rebels and the sinners will be broken togetherand those leaving jehovah will come to their finish
29  for they will be ashamed of the mighty trees that you desiredand you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you chose
30  for you will become like a big tree with withering leavesand like a garden without water
31  the strong man will become towand his work a sparkboth of them will go up in flames togetherwith no one to extinguish them
2  this is what isaiah the son of aʹmoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem
2  in the final part of the daysthe mountain of the house of jehovahwill become firmly established above the top of the mountainsand it will be raised up above the hillsand to it all the nations will stream
3  and many peoples will go and say come let us go up to the mountain of jehovahto the house of the god of jacob
he will instruct us about his waysand we will walk in his paths
for law will go out of zionand the word of jehovah out of jerusalem
4  he will render judgment among the nationsand set matters straight respecting many peoples
they will beat their swords into plowsharesand their spears into pruning shears
nation will not lift up sword against nationnor will they learn war anymore
5  o house of jacob comelet us walk in the light of jehovah
6  for you have forsaken your people the house of jacobbecause they have become full of things from the eastthey practice magic like the philisʹtinesand they abound with the children of foreigners
7  their land is filled with silver and goldand there is no limit to their treasures
their land is filled with horsesand there is no limit to their chariots
8  their land is filled with worthless gods
they bow down to the work of their own handsto what their own fingers have made
9  so man bows down he becomes lowand you cannot possibly pardon them
10  enter into the rock and hide yourself in the dustbecause of the terrifying presence of jehovahand his majestic splendor
11  the haughty eyes of man will be brought lowand the arrogance of men will bow down
jehovah alone will be exalted in that day
12  for it is the day belonging to jehovah of armies
it is coming upon everyone who is haughty and loftyupon everyone whether exalted or lowly
13  upon all the cedars of lebʹanon that are lofty and exaltedand upon all the oaks of baʹshan
14  upon all the lofty mountainsand upon all the high hills
15  upon every high tower and every fortified wall
16  upon all the ships of tarʹshishand upon all desirable boats
17  mans haughtiness will be brought downand the arrogance of men will bow low
jehovah alone will be exalted in that day
18  the worthless gods will completely disappear
19  and people will enter into the caves of the rocksand into the holes in the groundbecause of the terrifying presence of jehovahand his majestic splendorwhen he arises to make the earth tremble in terror
20  in that day men will take their worthless gods of silver and of goldthat they had made for themselves to bow down toand throw them away to the shrewmice and to the bats
21  in order to enter into the holes in the rocksand into the clefts of the cragsbecause of the terrifying presence of jehovahand his majestic splendorwhen he arises to make the earth tremble in terror
22  for your own sakes quit trusting in mere manwho is only the breath in his nostrils
why should he be taken into account
3  for look the true lord jehovah of armiesis removing from jerusalem and judah every kind of support and supplyall support of bread and water
2  mighty man and warriorjudge and prophet diviner and elder
3  chief of 50 dignitary and adviserthe expert magician and the skilled charmer
4  i will make boys their princesand the unstable will rule over them
5  the people will oppress one anothereach one his fellow man
the boy will assault the old manand the lightly esteemed one will defy the respected one
6  each one will take hold of his brother in his fathers house and say you have a cloakyou be our commander
take charge of this overthrown pile of ruins
7  but he will protest in that day i will not be your wound dresseri have no food or clothing in my house
do not make me commander over the people
8  for jerusalem has stumbledand judah has fallenbecause in word and deed they are against jehovahthey behave defiantly in his glorious presence
9  the expression of their faces testifies against themand they proclaim their sin like sodʹomthey do not try to hide it
woe to them for they are bringing disaster on themselves
10  tell the righteous that it will go well for themthey will be rewarded for what they do
11  woe to the wicked one disaster will befall himfor what his hands have done will be done to him
12  as for my people their taskmasters are abusiveand women rule over them
my people your leaders are causing you to wanderand they confuse the direction of your paths
13  jehovah is taking his position to accusehe is standing up to pass sentence on peoples
14  jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people
you have burned down the vineyardand what you have stolen from the poor is in your houses
15  how dare you crush my peopleand grind the faces of the poor in the dirt declares the sovereign lord jehovah of armies
16  jehovah says because the daughters of zion are haughtywalking with their heads highflirting with their eyes skipping alongmaking a tinkling sound with their anklets
17  jehovah will also strike the head of the daughters of zion with scabsand jehovah will make their forehead bare
18  in that day jehovah will take away the beauty of their banglesthe headbands and the crescentshaped ornaments
19  the earrings the bracelets and the veils
20  the headdresses the ankle chains and the breastbandsthe perfume receptacles and the charms
21  the finger rings and the nose rings
22  the ceremonial robes the overtunics the cloaks and the purses
23  the hand mirrors and the linen garmentsthe turbans and the veils
24  instead of balsam oil there will be a rotten smellinstead of a belt a ropeinstead of a beautiful hairstyle baldnessinstead of a rich garment a garment of sackclothand a brand mark instead of beauty
25  by the sword your men will falland your mighty men in battle
26  her entrances will mourn and grieveand she will sit on the ground desolate
33  woe to you you destroyer who has not been destroyedyou betrayer who has not been betrayed when you finish destroying you will be destroyed
when you finish betraying you will be betrayed
2  o jehovah show us favor
our hope is in you
become our arm every morningyes our salvation in the time of distress
3  at the sound of turmoil peoples flee
when you rise up nations scatter
4  as the voracious locusts gather so your spoil will be gatheredpeople will rush on it like swarms of locusts
5  jehovah will be exaltedfor he resides in the heights above
he will fill zion with justice and righteousness
6  he is the stability of your timesan abundance of salvation wisdom knowledge and the fear of jehovahthis is his treasure
7  look their heroes cry out in the streetthe messengers of peace weep bitterly
8  the highways are desertedthere is no one traveling on the pathways
he has broken the covenanthe has rejected the citieshe shows no regard for mortal man
9  the land mourns and withers away
lebʹanon is ashamed it has decayed
sharʹon has become like the desertand baʹshan and carʹmel shake off their leaves
10  now i will rise up says jehovahnow i will exalt myselfnow i will magnify myself
11  you conceive dried grass and give birth to stubble
your own spirit will consume you like a fire
12  and peoples will become as the burnings of lime
as thorns cut down they will be set ablaze with fire
13  you who are far away listen to what i will do and you who are nearby acknowledge my might
14  the sinners in zion are in dreadtrembling has seized the apostates who of us can live where there is a consuming fire who of us can live with unquenchable flames
15  the one who walks in continual righteousnesswho speaks what is uprightwho rejects dishonest fraudulent gainwhose hands refuse a bribe rather than grabbing itwho closes his ear to talk of bloodshedand who shuts his eyes to avoid seeing what is bad
16  he will reside in the heightshis secure refuge will be in rocky strongholdshis bread will be providedand his water supply will never fail
17  your eyes will behold a king in his splendorthey will see a land far away
18  in your heart you will recall the terror where is the secretary where is the one who weighed out the tribute where is the one who counted the towers
19  you will no more see the insolent peoplea people whose language is too obscure to comprehendwhose stammering tongue you cannot understand
20  behold zion the city of our festivals your eyes will see jerusalem as a tranquil dwelling placea tent that will not be moved
never will its tent pins be pulled outand none of its ropes will be torn apart
21  but there the majestic one jehovahwill be for us a region of rivers of wide canalswhere no galley fleet will goand no majestic ships will pass by
22  for jehovah is our judgejehovah is our lawgiverjehovah is our kinghe is the one who will save us
23  your ropes will hang loosethey cannot hold up the mast nor spread the sail
at that time an abundance of spoil will be divided upeven the lame will take much plunder
24  and no resident will say i am sick
the people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error
65  i have let myself be searched for by those who did not ask for mei have let myself be found by those who did not look for me
i said here i am here i am to a nation that was not calling on my name
2  i have spread out my hands all day long to a stubborn peopleto those walking in the way that is not goodfollowing their own thoughts
3  a people who constantly offend me to my facesacrificing in gardens and making sacrificial smoke on bricks
4  they sit among gravesand they pass the night in hidden placeseating the flesh of pigsand the broth of foul things is in their vessels
5  they say keep to yourself do not approach mefor i am holier than you
these are a smoke in my nostrils a fire burning all day long
6  look it is written before mei will not stand stillbut i will repay themi will repay them in full measure
7  for their errors and for the errors of their forefathers as well says jehovah
because they have made sacrificial smoke on the mountainsand have reproached me on the hillsi will first measure out their wages in full
8  this is what jehovah says just as when new wine is found in a cluster of grapesand someone says do not destroy it for there is some good in it so i will do for the sake of my servantsi will not destroy them all
9  i will bring out of jacob an offspringand out of judah the one to inherit my mountainsmy chosen ones will take possession of itand my servants will reside there
10  sharʹon will become a pasture for sheepand the valley of aʹchor a restingplace for cattlefor my people who search for me
11  but you are among those forsaking jehovahthose forgetting my holy mountainthose setting a table for the god of good luckand those filling up cups of mixed wine for the god of destiny
12  so i will destine you for the swordand all of you will bow down to be slaughteredbecause i called but you did not answeri spoke but you did not listenyou kept doing what was bad in my eyesand you chose what displeased me
13  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says look my servants will eat but you will go hungry
look my servants will drink but you will go thirsty
look my servants will rejoice but you will suffer shame
14  look my servants will shout joyfully because of the good condition of the heartbut you will cry out because of the pain of heartand you will wail because of a broken spirit
15  you will leave behind a name that my chosen ones will use as a curseand the sovereign lord jehovah will put each of you to deathbut his own servants he will call by another name
16  so that anyone who seeks a blessing for himself in the earthwill be blessed by the god of truthand anyone who swears an oath in the earthwill swear by the god of truth
for the former distresses will be forgottenthey will be concealed from my eyes
17  for look i am creating new heavens and a new earthand the former things will not be called to mindnor will they come up into the heart
18  so exult and be joyful forever in what i am creating
for look i am creating jerusalem a cause for joyand her people a cause for exultation
19  and i will rejoice in jerusalem and exult in my peopleno more will there be heard in her the sound of weeping or a cry of distress
20  no more will there be an infant from that place who lives but a few daysnor an old man who fails to live out his days
for anyone who dies at a hundred will be considered a mere boyand the sinner will be cursed even though he is a hundred years of age
21  they will build houses and live in themand they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage
22  they will not build for someone else to inhabitnor will they plant for others to eat
for the days of my people will be like the days of a treeand the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full
23  they will not toil for nothingnor will they bear children for distressbecause they are the offspring made up of those blessed by jehovahand their descendants with them
24  even before they call out i will answerwhile they are yet speaking i will hear
25  the wolf and the lamb will feed togetherthe lion will eat straw just like the bulland the serpents food will be dust
they will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain says jehovah
12  in that day you will certainly say i thank you o jehovahfor although you were angry with meyour anger gradually subsided and you comforted me
2  look god is my salvation
i will trust and feel no dreadfor jah jehovah is my strength and my mightand he has become my salvation
3  with rejoicing you will draw waterfrom the springs of salvation
4  and in that day you will say give thanks to jehovah call on his namemake his deeds known among the peoples declare that his name is exalted
5  sing praises to jehovah for he has done magnificent things
let this be made known in all the earth
6  cry out and shout for joy you inhabitant of zionfor great in your midst is the holy one of israel
