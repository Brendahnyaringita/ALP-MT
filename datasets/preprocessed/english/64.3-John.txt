1  the older man to gaʹius the beloved whom i truly love
2  beloved one i pray that in all things you continue to prosper and enjoy good health just as you are now prospering
3  for i rejoiced very much when brothers came and bore witness about the truth you hold as you go on walking in the truth
4  no greater joy do i have than this that i should hear that my children go on walking in the truth
5  beloved one you show your faithfulness in what you do for the brothers even though they are strangers to you
6  they have given a witness about your love before the congregation
please send them on their way in a manner worthy of god
7  for it was in behalf of his name that they went out not taking anything from the people of the nations
8  so we are under obligation to show hospitality to such ones so that we may become fellow workers in the truth
9  i wrote something to the congregation but diotʹrephes who likes to have the first place among them does not accept anything from us with respect
10  that is why if i come i will call attention to the works he is doing in spreading malicious talk about us
not being content with this he refuses to welcome the brothers with respect and those who want to welcome them he tries to hinder and to throw out of the congregation
11  beloved one do not imitate what is bad but imitate what is good
the one who does good originates with god
the one who does bad has not seen god
12  demeʹtrius has been wellreportedon by them all and by the truth itself
in fact we too are bearing witness about him and you know that the witness we give is true
13  i had many things to write you but i do not wish to go on writing you with pen and ink
14  however i am hoping to see you soon and we will speak facetoface
may you have peace
the friends send you their greetings
give my greetings to the friends by name
