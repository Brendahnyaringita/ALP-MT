10  from there he got up and came to the borders of judeʹa across the jordan and again crowds gathered to him
as he was accustomed to do he again began teaching them
2  and pharisees approached intent on testing him and they asked whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife
3  he answered them what did moses command you
4  they said moses allowed the writing of a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her
5  but jesus said to them out of regard for your hardheartedness he wrote this commandment for you
6  however from the beginning of creation he made them male and female
7  for this reason a man will leave his father and his mother
8  and the two will be one flesh so that they are no longer two but one flesh
9  therefore what god has yoked together let no man put apart
10  when they were again in the house the disciples began to question him about this
11  he said to them whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her
12  and if ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another she commits adultery
13  people now began bringing him young children for him to touch them but the disciples reprimanded them
14  at seeing this jesus was indignant and said to them let the young children come to me do not try to stop them for the kingdom of god belongs to such ones
15  truly i say to you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god like a young child will by no means enter into it
16  and he took the children into his arms and began blessing them laying his hands on them
17  as he was going on his way a man ran up and fell on his knees before him and put the question to him good teacher what must i do to inherit everlasting life
18  jesus said to him why do you call me good nobody is good except one god
19  you know the commandments do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness do not defraud honor your father and your mother
20  the man said to him teacher all these things i have kept from my youth on
21  jesus looked at him and felt love for him and said one thing is missing about you go sell what things you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come be my follower
22  but he grew sad at the answer and went away grieved for he had many possessions
23  after looking around jesus said to his disciples how difficult it will be for those with money to enter into the kingdom of god
24  but the disciples were surprised at his words
jesus then responded children how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of god
25  it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
26  they became still more astounded and said to him who possibly can be saved
27  looking straight at them jesus said with men it is impossible but not so with god for all things are possible with god
28  peter began to say to him look we have left all things and followed you
29  jesus said truly i say to you no one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news
30  who will not get 100 times more now in this period of timehouses brothers sisters mothers children and fields with persecutionsand in the coming system of things everlasting life
31  but many who are first will be last and the last first
32  now they were going on the road up to jerusalem and jesus was going ahead of them and they were astonished but those who followed began to fear
once again he took the twelve aside and started to tell them these things that were about to happen to him
33  look we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes
they will condemn him to death and hand him over to men of the nations
34  and these will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him but three days later he will rise
35  james and john the sons of zebʹedee approached him and said to him teacher we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you
36  he said to them what do you want me to do for you
37  they replied grant us to sit down one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory
38  but jesus said to them you do not know what you are asking for
can you drink the cup that i am drinking or be baptized with the baptism with which i am being baptized
39  they said to him we can
at that jesus said to them the cup i am drinking you will drink and with the baptism with which i am being baptized you will be baptized
40  however to sit down at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared
41  when the ten others heard about it they became indignant at james and john
42  but jesus called them to him and said to them you know that those who appear to be ruling the nations lord it over them and their great ones wield authority over them
43  this must not be the way among you but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister
44  and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all
45  for even the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many
46  they then came into jerʹicho
but as he and his disciples and a considerable crowd were going out of jerʹicho bartimaeʹus the son of timaeʹus a blind beggar was sitting beside the road
47  when he heard that it was jesus the nazareneʹ he started shouting and saying son of david jesus have mercy on me
48  at this many began rebuking him telling him to be silent but all the more he kept shouting son of david have mercy on me
49  so jesus stopped and said call him to me
so they called the blind man saying to him take courage get up he is calling you
50  throwing off his outer garment he leaped to his feet and went to jesus
51  then jesus said to him what do you want me to do for you the blind man said to him rabboʹni let me recover my sight
52  and jesus said to him go
your faith has made you well
and immediately he recovered his sight and he began to follow him on the road
4  again he began teaching beside the sea and a very large crowd gathered near him
so he went aboard a boat and sat in it away from the shore but the whole crowd was next to the sea along the shore
2  and he began to teach them many things with illustrations and while he was teaching he said to them
3  listen
look the sower went out to sow
4  as he was sowing some seeds fell alongside the road and the birds came and ate them up
5  others fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil and they immediately sprang up because the soil was not deep
6  but when the sun rose they were scorched and they withered because they had no root
7  other seeds fell among the thorns and the thorns came up and choked them and they yielded no fruit
8  but others fell on the fine soil and growing up and increasing they began to yield fruit and they were bearing 30 60 and 100 times more
9  then he added let the one who has ears to listen listen
10  now when he was alone those around him with the twelve began questioning him about the illustrations
11  he said to them to you the sacred secret of the kingdom of god has been given but to those outside all things are in illustrations
12  so that though looking they may look and still not see and though hearing they may hear and still not get the sense of it nor will they ever turn back and receive forgiveness
13  further he said to them you do not know this illustration so how will you understand all the other illustrations
14  the sower sows the word
15  these then are the ones alongside the road where the word is sown but as soon as they have heard it satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them
16  likewise these are the ones sown on rocky ground as soon as they have heard the word they accept it with joy
17  yet they have no root in themselves but they continue for a time then as soon as tribulation or persecution arises because of the word they are stumbled
18  there are still others that are sown among the thorns
these are the ones who have heard the word
19  but the anxieties of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches and the desires for everything else make inroads and choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
20  finally the ones that were sown on the fine soil are those who listen to the word and favorably receive it and bear fruit30 60 and 100 times more
21  he also said to them a lamp is not brought out to be put under a basket or under a bed is it is it not brought out to be put on a lampstand
22  for there is nothing hidden that will not be exposed nothing is carefully concealed that will not come out in the open
23  whoever has ears to listen let him listen
24  he further said to them pay attention to what you are hearing
with the measure that you are measuring out you will have it measured out to you yes you will have more added to you
25  for whoever has will have more given to him but whoever does not have even what he has will be taken away from him
26  so he went on to say in this way the kingdom of god is just as when a man casts seeds on the ground
27  he sleeps at night and rises up by day and the seeds sprout and grow talljust how he does not know
28  on its own the ground bears fruit gradually first the stalk then the head finally the full grain in the head
29  but as soon as the crop permits it he thrusts in the sickle because the harvesttime has come
30  and he went on to say with what can we compare the kingdom of god or with what illustration can we explain it
31  it is like a mustard grain which at the time it was sown in the ground was the tiniest of all the seeds on the earth
32  but when it has been sown it grows and becomes greater than all other vegetable plants and produces great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to find lodging under its shadow
33  with many illustrations of that sort he spoke the word to them to the extent that they were able to listen
34  indeed without an illustration he would not speak to them but he would explain all things privately to his disciples
35  and on that day when evening had fallen he said to them let us cross to the other shore
36  so after they had dismissed the crowd they took him in the boat just as he was and there were other boats with him
37  now a great violent windstorm broke out and the waves kept crashing into the boat so that the boat was close to being swamped
38  but he was in the stern sleeping on the pillow
so they woke him up and said to him teacher do you not care that we are about to perish
39  with that he got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea hush be quiet and the wind abated and a great calm set in
40  so he said to them why are you so afraid do you not yet have any faith
41  but they felt an unusual fear and they said to one another who really is this even the wind and the sea obey him
11  now when they were getting near to jerusalem to bethʹphage and bethʹany at the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples
2  and told them go into the village that is within sight and as soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied on which no man has sat until now
untie it and bring it here
3  and if anyone says to you why are you doing this say the lord needs it and will send it back here right away
4  so they went away and found the colt tied at a door outside on the side street and they untied it
5  but some of those standing there said to them what are you doing untying the colt
6  they told them just what jesus had said and they let them go
7  and they brought the colt to jesus and they put their outer garments on it and he sat on it
8  also many spread their outer garments on the road but others cut down foliage from the fields
9  and those going in front and those coming behind kept shouting save we pray blessed is the one who comes in jehovahs name
10  blessed is the coming kingdom of our father david save we pray in the heights above
11  and he entered jerusalem and went into the temple and he looked around at everything but since the hour was already late he went out to bethʹany with the twelve
12  the next day when they were leaving bethʹany he felt hungry
13  from a distance he caught sight of a fig tree that had leaves and he went to see whether he could find something on it
but on coming to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs
14  so he said to it let no one eat fruit from you ever again
and his disciples were listening
15  they now came to jerusalem
there he entered the temple and started to throw out those selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves
16  and he would not let anyone carry a utensil through the temple
17  he was teaching and saying to them is it not written my house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations but you have made it a cave of robbers
18  and the chief priests and the scribes heard it and they began to seek how to kill him for they were in fear of him because all the crowd was astounded at his teaching
19  when it became late in the day they went out of the city
20  but when they were passing by early in the morning they saw the fig tree already withered from its roots
21  peter remembering it said to him rabbi see the fig tree that you cursed has withered
22  in reply jesus said to them have faith in god
23  truly i say to you that whoever tells this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but has faith that what he says is going to happen he will have it happen
24  this is why i tell you all the things you pray and ask for have faith that you have received them and you will have them
25  and when you stand praying forgive whatever you have against anyone so that your father who is in the heavens may also forgive you your trespasses
26  
27  they came again to jerusalem
and as he was walking in the temple the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came
28  and said to him by what authority do you do these things or who gave you this authority to do these things
29  jesus said to them i will ask you one question
answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
30  was the baptism by john from heaven or from men answer me
31  so they began to reason among themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say why then did you not believe him
32  but dare we say from men they were in fear of the crowd for these all held that john had really been a prophet
33  so they answered jesus we do not know
jesus said to them neither am i telling you by what authority i do these things
8  in those days there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat
so he summoned the disciples and said to them
2  i feel pity for the crowd because they have already stayed with me for three days and they have nothing to eat
3  if i send them off to their homes hungry they will give out on the road and some of them are from far away
4  but his disciples answered him from where will anyone get enough bread in this isolated place to satisfy these people
5  at this he asked them how many loaves do you have they said seven
6  and he instructed the crowd to recline on the ground
then he took the seven loaves gave thanks broke them and began giving them to his disciples to serve and they served them to the crowd
7  they also had a few small fish and blessing these he told them to serve these also
8  so they ate and were satisfied and they took up seven large baskets full of leftover fragments
9  now there were about 4000 men
then he sent them away
10  immediately he boarded the boat with his disciples and came into the region of dalmanuʹtha
11  here the pharisees came and started disputing with him demanding from him a sign from heaven to put him to the test
12  so he sighed deeply in his spirit and said why does this generation seek a sign truly i say no sign will be given to this generation
13  with that he left them got aboard again and went to the opposite shore
14  however they forgot to take bread along and they had nothing with them in the boat except for one loaf
15  and he warned them in no uncertain terms keep your eyes open look out for the leaven of the pharisees and the leaven of herod
16  so they began arguing with one another over the fact that they had no bread
17  noting this he said to them why do you argue over your having no bread do you not yet perceive and understand are your hearts still dull in understanding
18  though having eyes do you not see and though having ears do you not hear do you not remember
19  when i broke the five loaves for the 5000 men how many baskets full of fragments you collected they said to him twelve
20  when i broke the seven loaves for the 4000 men how many large baskets full of fragments did you take up and they said to him seven
21  with that he said to them do you not yet understand
22  now they put in at bethsaʹida
here people brought him a blind man and they pleaded with him to touch him
23  and he took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside the village
after spitting on his eyes he laid his hands on him and asked him do you see anything
24  the man looked up and said i see people but they look like trees walking about
25  again he laid his hands on the mans eyes and the man saw clearly
his sight was restored and he could see everything distinctly
26  so he sent him home saying do not enter into the village
27  jesus and his disciples now left for the villages of caesareʹa philipʹpi and on the way he began to question his disciples saying who are people saying that i am
28  they said to him john the baptist but others say eliʹjah and still others one of the prophets
29  and he put the question to them you though who do you say i am peter answered him you are the christ
30  at that he strictly ordered them not to tell anyone about him
31  also he began teaching them that the son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and rise three days later
32  indeed he was making that statement openly
but peter took him aside and began to rebuke him
33  at this he turned looked at his disciples and rebuked peter saying get behind me satan because you think not gods thoughts but those of men
34  he now called the crowd to him with his disciples and said to them if anyone wants to come after me let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me
35  for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the sake of the good news will save it
36  really what good will it do a man to gain the whole world and to lose his life
37  what really would a man give in exchange for his life
38  for whoever becomes ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
16  so when the sabbath was over mary magʹdalene mary the mother of james and saloʹme bought spices in order to come and apply them to his body
2  and very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen they came to the tomb
3  they were saying to one another who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us
4  but when they looked up they saw that the stone had been rolled away although it was very large
5  when they entered into the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a white robe and they were stunned
6  he said to them do not be stunned
you are looking for jesus the nazareneʹ who was executed on the stake
he was raised up
he is not here
look here is the place where they laid him
7  but go tell his disciples and peter he is going ahead of you into galʹilee
you will see him there just as he told you
8  so when they came out they fled from the tomb trembling and overwhelmed with emotion
and they said nothing to anyone for they were in fear
9  furthermore he said to them truly i say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the kingdom of god already having come in power
2  six days later jesus took peter and james and john along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves
and he was transfigured before them
3  his outer garments began to glisten becoming far whiter than any clothes cleaner on earth could whiten them
4  also eliʹjah with moses appeared to them and they were conversing with jesus
5  then peter said to jesus rabbi it is fine for us to be here
so let us erect three tents one for you one for moses and one for eliʹjah
6  in fact he did not know how to react for they were quite fearful
7  and a cloud formed overshadowing them and a voice came out of the cloud this is my son the beloved
listen to him
8  then suddenly they looked around and saw that no one was with them any longer except jesus
9  as they were coming down from the mountain he strictly ordered them not to relate to anybody what they had seen until after the son of man had risen from the dead
10  they took the word to heart but discussed among themselves what this rising from the dead meant
11  and they began to question him saying why do the scribes say that eliʹjah must come first
12  he said to them eliʹjah does come first and restore all things but how is it that it is written about the son of man that he must undergo many sufferings and be treated with contempt
13  but i say to you that eliʹjah in fact has come and they did to him whatever they wanted just as it is written about him
14  when they came to the other disciples they noticed a large crowd around them and there were scribes arguing with them
15  but as soon as all the crowd caught sight of him they were astonished and they ran up to him to greet him
16  so he asked them what are you arguing about with them
17  and one of the crowd answered him teacher i brought my son to you because he has a speechless spirit
18  wherever it seizes him it throws him to the ground and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and loses his strength
i asked your disciples to expel it but they were not able to do so
19  in response he said to them o faithless generation how long must i continue with you how long must i put up with you bring him to me
20  so they brought the boy to him but at the sight of him the spirit at once threw the child into convulsions
after falling on the ground he kept rolling about foaming at the mouth
21  then jesus asked the father how long has this been happening to him he said from childhood on
22  and often it would throw him into the fire and also into the water to destroy him
but if you can do anything have pity on us and help us
23  jesus said to him that expression if you can why all things are possible for the one who has faith
24  immediately the childs father cried out and said i have faith help me out where i need faith
25  jesus now noticing that a crowd was rushing toward them rebuked the unclean spirit saying to it you speechless and deaf spirit i order you get out of him and do not enter into him again
26  after crying out and going through many convulsions it came out and the child seemed to be dead so that most of the people were saying he is dead
27  but jesus took him by the hand and raised him up and he stood up
28  so after he entered into a house his disciples asked him privately why could we not expel it
29  he said to them this kind can come out only by prayer
30  they departed from there and went through galʹilee but he did not want anyone to get to know about it
31  for he was teaching his disciples and telling them the son of man is going to be betrayed into mens hands and they will kill him but despite being killed he will rise three days later
32  however they did not understand his statement and they were afraid to question him
33  and they came into caperʹnaum
now when he was inside the house he put the question to them what were you arguing about on the road
34  they kept silent for on the road they had been arguing among themselves about who is greater
35  so he sat down and called the twelve and said to them if anyone wants to be first he must be last of all and minister of all
36  then he took a young child and stood him in their midst and putting his arms around him he said to them
37  whoever receives one of such young children on the basis of my name receives me also and whoever receives me receives not me only but also him who sent me
38  john said to him teacher we saw someone expelling demons by using your name and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us
39  but jesus said do not try to prevent him for there is no one who will do a powerful work on the basis of my name who will quickly be able to say anything bad about me
40  for whoever is not against us is for us
41  and whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to christ i tell you truly he will by no means lose his reward
42  but whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith it would be better for him if a millstone that is turned by a donkey were put around his neck and he were pitched into the sea
43  if ever your hand makes you stumble cut it off
it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to go off with two hands into gehenʹna into the fire that cannot be put out
44  
45  and if your foot makes you stumble cut it off
it is better for you to enter into life lame than to be thrown with two feet into gehenʹna
46  
47  and if your eye makes you stumble throw it away
it is better for you to enter oneeyed into the kingdom of god than to be thrown with two eyes into gehenʹna
48  where the maggot does not die and the fire is not put out
49  for everyone must be salted with fire
50  salt is fine but if the salt ever loses its saltiness with what will you season it have salt in yourselves and keep peace with one another
7  now the pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from jerusalem gathered around him
2  and they saw some of his disciples eat their meal with defiled hands that is unwashed ones
3  for the pharisees and all the jews do not eat unless they wash their hands up to the elbow clinging to the tradition of the men of former times
4  and when they come from the market they do not eat unless they wash themselves
there are many other traditions that they have received and cling to such as baptisms of cups pitchers and copper vessels
5  so these pharisees and scribes asked him why do your disciples not observe the tradition of the men of former times but they eat their meal with defiled hands
6  he said to them isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites as it is written this people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far removed from me
7  it is in vain that they keep worshipping me for they teach commands of men as doctrines
8  you let go of the commandment of god and cling to the tradition of men
9  further he said to them you skillfully disregard the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition
10  for example moses said honor your father and your mother and let the one who speaks abusively of his father or mother be put to death
11  but you say if a man says to his father or his mother whatever i have that could benefit you is corban that is a gift dedicated to god
12  you no longer let him do a single thing for his father or his mother
13  thus you make the word of god invalid by your tradition that you have handed down
and you do many things like this
14  so calling the crowd to him again he said to them listen to me all of you and understand the meaning
15  nothing from outside a man that enters into him can defile him but the things that come out of a man are the things that defile him
16  
17  now when he had entered a house away from the crowd his disciples began to question him about the illustration
18  so he said to them are you also without understanding like them are you not aware that nothing from outside that enters into a man can defile him
19  since it enters not into his heart but into his stomach and it passes out into the sewer thus he declared all foods clean
20  further he said that which comes out of a man is what defiles him
21  for from inside out of the heart of men come injurious reasonings sexual immorality thefts murders
22  acts of adultery greed acts of wickedness deceit brazen conduct an envious eye blasphemy haughtiness and unreasonableness
23  all these wicked things come from within and defile a man
24  he rose up from there and went into the region of tyre and siʹdon
there he entered into a house and did not want anyone to know it but he could not escape notice
25  immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down at his feet
26  the woman was a greek a syrophoeniʹcian by nationality and she kept asking him to expel the demon from her daughter
27  but he said to her first let the children be satisfied for it is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs
28  but she replied to him yes sir and yet even the little dogs underneath the table eat of the crumbs of the little children
29  at that he said to her because you said this go the demon has gone out of your daughter
30  so she went away to her home and found the young child lying on the bed and the demon was gone
31  when jesus returned from the region of tyre he went through siʹdon to the sea of galʹilee through the region of decapʹolis
32  here they brought him a deaf man with a speech impediment and they pleaded with him to lay his hand on him
33  and he took him aside privately away from the crowd
then he put his fingers into the mans ears and after spitting he touched his tongue
34  and looking up into heaven he sighed deeply and said to him ephʹphatha that is be opened
35  at this his ears were opened and his speech impediment was removed and he began speaking normally
36  with that he ordered them not to tell anyone but the more he would order them the more they would proclaim it
37  indeed they were astounded beyond measure and they said he has done all things well
he even makes the deaf hear and the speechless speak
6  he departed from there and came into his home territory and his disciples followed him
2  when it was the sabbath he started teaching in the synagogue and most who heard him were astounded and said where did this man get these things and why should this wisdom have been given to him and such powerful works be performed through his hands
3  this is the carpenter the son of mary and the brother of james joseph judas and simon is it not and his sisters are here with us are they not so they began to stumble because of him
4  but jesus said to them a prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and among his relatives and in his own house
5  so he was not able to do any powerful work there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and cure them
6  indeed he was amazed at their lack of faith
and he went around in a circuit to the villages teaching
7  he now summoned the twelve and started sending them out two by two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits
8  also he gave them orders to carry nothing for the trip except a staffno bread no food pouch no money in their belts
9  but to put on sandals and not to wear two garments
10  further he said to them wherever you enter into a home stay there until you leave that place
11  and wherever a place will not receive you or listen to you on going out from there shake off the dirt that is on your feet for a witness to them
12  then they set out and preached that people should repent
13  and they expelled many demons and greased many sick people with oil and cured them
14  now king herod heard of this for the name of jesus became wellknown and people were saying john the baptizer has been raised up from the dead and that is why the powerful works are operating in him
15  but others were saying it is eliʹjah
still others were saying it is a prophet like one of the prophets of old
16  but when herod heard it he said the john whom i beheaded this one has been raised up
17  for herod himself had sent out and arrested john and had bound him in prison on account of heroʹdias the wife of philip his brother because he had married her
18  for john had been saying to herod it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife
19  so heroʹdias was nursing a grudge against him and wanted to kill him but she could not
20  for herod was in fear of john knowing him to be a righteous and holy man and he was keeping him safe
after hearing him he was at a great loss as to what to do yet he continued to hear him gladly
21  but a convenient day arrived when herod spread an evening meal on his birthday for his high officials and the military commanders and the most prominent men of galʹilee
22  and the daughter of heroʹdias came in and danced and pleased herod and those dining with him
the king said to the girl ask me for whatever you want and i will give it to you
23  yes he swore to her whatever you ask me for i will give it to you up to half my kingdom
24  so she went out and said to her mother what should i ask for she said the head of john the baptizer
25  she immediately rushed in to the king and made her request saying i want you to give me right away on a platter the head of john the baptist
26  although this deeply grieved him the king did not want to disregard her request because of his oaths and his guests
27  so the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring johns head
so he went off and beheaded him in the prison
28  and brought his head on a platter
he gave it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother
29  when his disciples heard of it they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb
30  the apostles gathered around jesus and reported to him all the things they had done and taught
31  and he said to them come you yourselves privately into an isolated place and rest up a little
for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure time even to eat a meal
32  so they set off in the boat for an isolated place to be by themselves
33  but people saw them going and many got to know it and from all the cities they ran together on foot and got there ahead of them
34  well on getting out he saw a large crowd and he was moved with pity for them because they were as sheep without a shepherd
and he started to teach them many things
35  by now the hour had grown late and his disciples came up to him and said this place is isolated and the hour is already late
36  send them away so that they may go off into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat
37  he replied to them you give them something to eat
at this they said to him should we go off and buy 200 denarʹii worth of bread and give it to the people to eat
38  he said to them how many loaves do you have go see after finding out they said five besides two fish
39  and he instructed all the people to recline in groups on the green grass
40  so they reclined in groups of 100 and of 50
41  taking now the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing
then he broke the loaves up and began giving them to the disciples to place them before the people and he divided up the two fish for all
42  so they all ate and were satisfied
43  and they took up 12 baskets full of fragments aside from the fish
44  those who ate the loaves were 5000 men
45  then without delay he made his disciples board the boat and go on ahead to the opposite shore toward bethsaʹida while he himself sent the crowd away
46  but after saying goodbye to them he went to a mountain to pray
47  when evening had fallen the boat was in the middle of the sea but he was alone on the land
48  so when he saw them struggling to row for the wind was against them about the fourth watch of the night he came toward them walking on the sea but he was inclined to pass them by
49  on catching sight of him walking on the sea they thought it is an apparition and they cried out
50  for they all saw him and were troubled
but immediately he spoke to them and said take courage it is i do not be afraid
51  then he got up into the boat with them and the wind abated
at this they were utterly amazed
52  for they had not grasped the meaning of the loaves but their hearts continued dull in understanding
53  when they got across to land they came to gennesʹaret and anchored the boat nearby
54  but as soon as they got out of the boat people recognized him
55  they ran around all that region and started to bring on stretchers those who were ailing to where they heard he was
56  and wherever he would enter into villages or cities or the countryside they would place the sick ones in the marketplaces and they would plead with him that they might touch just the fringe of his outer garment
and all those who touched it were made well
13  as he was going out of the temple one of his disciples said to him teacher see what wonderful stones and buildings
2  however jesus said to him do you see these great buildings by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down
3  as he was sitting on the mount of olives with the temple in view peter james john and andrew asked him privately
4  tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign when all these things are to come to a conclusion
5  so jesus began to tell them look out that nobody misleads you
6  many will come on the basis of my name saying i am he and will mislead many
7  moreover when you hear of wars and reports of wars do not be alarmed these things must take place but the end is not yet
8  for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in one place after another there will also be food shortages
these are a beginning of pangs of distress
9  as for you look out for yourselves
people will hand you over to local courts and you will be beaten in synagogues and be put on the stand before governors and kings for my sake for a witness to them
10  also in all the nations the good news has to be preached first
11  and when they are taking you to hand you over do not be anxious beforehand about what to say but whatever is given you in that hour say this for you are not the ones speaking but the holy spirit is
12  furthermore brother will deliver brother over to death and a father a child and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death
13  and you will be hated by all people on account of my name
but the one who has endured to the end will be saved
14  however when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation standing where it should not be let the reader use discernment then let those in judeʹa begin fleeing to the mountains
15  let the man on the housetop not come down nor go inside to take anything out of his house
16  and let the man in the field not return to the things behind to pick up his outer garment
17  woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days
18  keep praying that it may not occur in wintertime
19  for those days will be days of a tribulation such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation that god created until that time and will not occur again
20  in fact unless jehovah had cut short the days no flesh would be saved
but on account of the chosen ones whom he has chosen he has cut short the days
21  then too if anyone says to you see here is the christ or see there he is do not believe it
22  for false christs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray if possible the chosen ones
23  you then watch out
i have told you all things beforehand
24  but in those days after that tribulation the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light
25  and the stars will be falling out of heaven and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken
26  and then they will see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
27  and then he will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds from earths extremity to heavens extremity
28  now learn this illustration from the fig tree just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves you know that summer is near
29  likewise also you when you see these things happening know that he is near at the doors
30  truly i say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen
31  heaven and earth will pass away but my words will by no means pass away
32  concerning that day or the hour nobody knows neither the angels in heaven nor the son but the father
33  keep looking keep awake for you do not know when the appointed time is
34  it is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves to each one his work and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch
35  keep on the watch therefore for you do not know when the master of the house is coming whether late in the day or at midnight or before dawn or early in the morning
36  in order that when he comes suddenly he does not find you sleeping
37  but what i say to you i say to all keep on the watch
14  now the passover and the festival of unleavened bread was two days later
and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to seize him by cunning and kill him
2  for they were saying not at the festival perhaps there might be an uproar of the people
3  and while he was at bethʹany dining in the house of simon the leper a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil genuine nard very expensive
she broke open the alabaster jar and began pouring it on his head
4  at this some said to one another indignantly why has this perfumed oil been wasted
5  for this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than 300 denarʹii and the money given to the poor and they were greatly annoyed with her
6  but jesus said let her alone
why do you try to make trouble for her she did a fine deed toward me
7  for you always have the poor with you and you can do them good whenever you want to but you will not always have me
8  she did what she could she poured perfumed oil on my body beforehand in view of the burial
9  truly i say to you wherever the good news is preached in all the world what this woman did will also be told in memory of her
10  and judas iscarʹiot one of the twelve went off to the chief priests in order to betray him to them
11  when they heard it they were delighted and promised to give him silver money
so he began seeking an opportunity to betray him
12  now on the first day of the unleavened bread when they customarily offered up the passover sacrifice his disciples said to him where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the passover
13  with that he sent two of his disciples and said to them go into the city and a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you
follow him
14  and wherever he goes inside say to the master of the house the teacher says where is the guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples
15  and he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready
prepare it for us there
16  so the disciples went out and they entered the city and found it just as he said to them and they prepared for the passover
17  after evening had fallen he came with the twelve
18  and as they were reclining at the table and eating jesus said truly i say to you one of you who is eating with me will betray me
19  they began to be grieved and to say to him one by one it is not i is it
20  he said to them it is one of the twelve the one dipping with me into the bowl
21  for the son of man is going away just as it is written about him but woe to that man through whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that man if he had not been born
22  and as they continued eating he took a loaf said a blessing broke it and gave it to them saying take it this means my body
23  and taking a cup he offered thanks and gave it to them and they all drank out of it
24  and he said to them this means my blood of the covenant which is to be poured out in behalf of many
25  truly i say to you i will by no means drink anymore of the product of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god
26  finally after singing praises they went out to the mount of olives
27  and jesus said to them you will all be stumbled for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered about
28  but after i have been raised up i will go ahead of you into galʹilee
29  but peter said to him even if all the others are stumbled i will not be
30  at that jesus said to him truly i say to you that today yes on this very night before a rooster crows twice you will disown me three times
31  but he kept insisting if i have to die with you i will by no means disown you
also all the others began to say the same thing
32  so they came to a spot named gethsemʹane and he said to his disciples sit down here while i pray
33  and he took peter and james and john along with him and he began to feel deeply distressed and to be greatly troubled
34  he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death
stay here and keep on the watch
35  and going a little way forward he fell to the ground and began praying that if it were possible the hour might pass away from him
36  and he said abba father all things are possible for you remove this cup from me
yet not what i want but what you want
37  he returned and found them sleeping and he said to peter simon are you sleeping did you not have the strength to keep on the watch for one hour
38  keep on the watch and pray continually so that you do not come into temptation
the spirit of course is eager but the flesh is weak
39  and he went away again and prayed saying the same thing
40  and he came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were weighed down so they did not know what to answer him
41  and he returned the third time and said to them at such a time as this you are sleeping and resting it is enough the hour has come look the son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners
42  get up let us go
look my betrayer has drawn near
43  and immediately while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived and with him a crowd with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
44  now his betrayer had given them an agreed sign saying whoever it is i kiss he is the one take him into custody and lead him away under guard
45  and he came straight up and approached him and said rabbi and gave him a tender kiss
46  so they seized him and took him into custody
47  however one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest taking off his ear
48  but in response jesus said to them did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber
49  day after day i was with you in the temple teaching and yet you did not take me into custody
nevertheless this is to fulfill the scriptures
50  and they all abandoned him and fled
51  however a certain young man wearing only a fine linen garment over his naked body began to follow him nearby and they tried to seize him
52  but he left his linen garment behind and got away naked
53  they now led jesus away to the high priest and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes assembled
54  but peter from a good distance followed him as far as into the courtyard of the high priest and he was sitting together with the house attendants and warming himself before a bright fire
55  now the chief priests and the entire sanʹhedrin were looking for testimony against jesus in order to put him to death but they were not finding any
56  many indeed were giving false witness against him but their testimonies were not in agreement
57  also certain ones were standing up and bearing false witness against him saying
58  we heard him say i will throw down this temple that was made with hands and in three days i will build another not made with hands
59  but even on these grounds their testimony was not in agreement
60  then the high priest stood up in their midst and questioned jesus saying do you say nothing in reply what is it these men are testifying against you
61  but he kept silent and made no reply at all
again the high priest began to question him and said to him are you the christ the son of the blessed one
62  then jesus said i am and you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven
63  at this the high priest ripped his garments and said what further need do we have of witnesses
64  you heard the blasphemy
what is your decision they all condemned him as deserving of death
65  and some started to spit on him and to cover his face and hit him with their fists and say to him prophesy and slapping him in the face the court attendants took him
66  now while peter was below in the courtyard one of the servant girls of the high priest came
67  on seeing peter warming himself she looked straight at him and said you too were with the nazareneʹ this jesus
68  but he denied it saying neither do i know him nor do i understand what you are talking about and he went outside to the entryway
69  there the servant girl saw him and again began to say to those standing by this is one of them
70  again he was denying it
and after a little while those standing by again began saying to peter certainly you are one of them for you are in fact a galileʹan
71  but he started to curse and swear i do not know this man of whom you speak
72  immediately a rooster crowed a second time and peter recalled what jesus had said to him before a rooster crows twice you will disown me three times
and he broke down and began to weep
5  then they came to the other side of the sea into the region of the gerʹasenes
2  and immediately after jesus got out of the boat a man under the power of an unclean spirit met him from among the tombs
3  his haunt was among the tombs and up to that time absolutely no one was able to bind him securely even with a chain
4  he had often been bound with fetters and chains but he snapped the chains apart and smashed the fetters and nobody had the strength to subdue him
5  and continually night and day he was crying out in the tombs and in the mountains and slashing himself with stones
6  but on catching sight of jesus from a distance he ran and bowed down to him
7  then he cried out with a loud voice what have i to do with you jesus son of the most high god i put you under oath by god not to torment me
8  for jesus had been saying to it come out of the man you unclean spirit
9  but jesus asked him what is your name and he replied my name is legion because there are many of us
10  and he kept pleading with jesus not to send the spirits out of the country
11  now a great herd of swine was feeding there at the mountain
12  so the spirits pleaded with him send us into the swine so that we may enter into them
13  and he gave them permission
with that the unclean spirits came out and went into the swine and the herd rushed over the precipice into the sea about 2000 of them and were drowned in the sea
14  but their herders fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside and people came to see what had happened
15  so they came to jesus and saw the demonpossessed man the one who previously had the legion sitting clothed and in his right mind and they grew fearful
16  also those who had seen it related to them how this had happened to the demonpossessed man and the swine
17  so they began to plead with jesus to go away from their region
18  now as he was boarding the boat the man who had been demonpossessed pleaded to go with him
19  however he did not let him but said to him go home to your relatives and report to them all the things jehovah has done for you and the mercy he has shown you
20  this man went away and started to proclaim in the decapʹolis all the things jesus had done for him and all the people were amazed
21  after jesus had crossed again by boat to the opposite shore a large crowd gathered together to him and he was by the sea
22  one of the presiding officers of the synagogue named jaʹirus now came and on catching sight of him he fell at his feet
23  he pleaded with him many times saying my little daughter is extremely ill
please come and put your hands on her so that she may get well and live
24  at that jesus went with him and a large crowd was following him and pressing against him
25  now there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for 12 years
26  she had suffered much at the hands of many physicians and had spent all her resources and she was no better but rather had become worse
27  when she heard the reports about jesus she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his outer garment
28  for she kept saying if i touch just his outer garments i will get well
29  and immediately her flow of blood dried up and she sensed in her body that she had been healed of the grievous sickness
30  immediately jesus realized in himself that power had gone out of him and he turned around in the crowd and asked who touched my outer garments
31  but his disciples said to him you see the crowd pressing in on you and you ask who touched me
32  however he was looking around to see who had done this
33  the woman frightened and trembling knowing what had happened to her came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth
34  he said to her daughter your faith has made you well
go in peace and be healed from your grievous sickness
35  while he was yet speaking some men from the home of the presiding officer of the synagogue came and said your daughter died why bother the teacher any longer
36  but jesus overheard their words and said to the presiding officer of the synagogue have no fear only exercise faith
37  now he did not let anyone follow him except peter james and john the brother of james
38  so they came to the house of the presiding officer of the synagogue and he saw the commotion and those weeping and wailing loudly
39  after stepping in he said to them why are you weeping and causing this commotion the child has not died but is sleeping
40  at this they began to laugh at him scornfully
but after sending them all outside he took the childs father and mother and those with him and he went in where the child was
41  then taking the hand of the child he said to her talʹitha cuʹmi which when translated means little girl i say to you get up
42  and immediately the girl rose and began walking
she was 12 years old
and at once they were beside themselves with great ecstasy
43  but he ordered them again and again to let no one learn of this and he said that something should be given her to eat
15  immediately at dawn the chief priests with the elders and the scribes indeed the whole sanʹhedrin consulted together and they bound jesus and led him off and handed him over to pilate
2  so pilate put the question to him are you the king of the jews in answer he said you yourself say it
3  but the chief priests were accusing him of many things
4  now pilate began questioning him again saying have you no reply to make see how many charges they are bringing against you
5  but jesus made no further answer so that pilate was amazed
6  well from festival to festival he used to release to them one prisoner whom they requested
7  at the time the man named barabʹbas was in prison with the seditionists who in their sedition had committed murder
8  so the crowd came up and began to make their request according to what pilate used to do for them
9  he responded to them saying do you want me to release to you the king of the jews
10  for pilate was aware that out of envy the chief priests had handed him over
11  but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release barabʹbas to them instead
12  again in reply pilate said to them what then should i do with the one you call the king of the jews
13  once more they cried out to the stake with him
14  but pilate went on to say to them why what bad thing did he do still they cried out all the more to the stake with him
15  at that pilate wishing to satisfy the crowd released barabʹbas to them and after having jesus whipped he handed him over to be executed on the stake
16  the soldiers now led him off into the courtyard that is into the governors residence and they called the whole body of troops together
17  and they dressed him in purple and braided a crown of thorns and put it on him
18  and they began to call out to him greetings you king of the jews
19  also they were hitting him on the head with a reed and spitting on him and they got on their knees and bowed down to him
20  finally after they had mocked him they stripped him of the purple and put his outer garments on him
and they led him out to nail him to the stake
21  also they compelled into service a passerby a certain simon of cyreʹne coming from the countryside the father of alexander and ruʹfus to carry his torture stake
22  so they brought him to the place called golʹgotha which means when translated skull place
23  here they tried to give him wine drugged with myrrh but he would not take it
24  and they nailed him to the stake and distributed his outer garments by casting lots over them to decide who would take what
25  it was now the third hour and they nailed him to the stake
26  and the inscription of the charge against him was written the king of the jews
27  moreover they put two robbers on stakes alongside him one on his right and one on his left
28  
29  and those passing by spoke abusively to him shaking their heads and saying ha you who would throw down the temple and build it in three days
30  save yourself by coming down off the torture stake
31  in the same way also the chief priests with the scribes were mocking him among themselves saying others he saved himself he cannot save
32  let the christ the king of israel now come down off the torture stake so that we may see and believe
even those who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him
33  when it became the sixth hour a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour
34  and at the ninth hour jesus called out with a loud voice eʹli eʹli laʹma sabachthaʹni which means when translated my god my god why have you forsaken me
35  and some of those standing near on hearing it began to say see he is calling eliʹjah
36  then someone ran soaked a sponge in sour wine put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink saying let him be let us see whether eliʹjah comes to take him down
37  but jesus let out a loud cry and expired
38  and the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom
39  now when the army officer who was standing by with him in view saw that he had expired under these circumstances he said certainly this man was gods son
40  there were also women watching from a distance among them mary magʹdalene as well as mary the mother of james the less and of joʹses and saloʹme
41  who used to accompany him and minister to him when he was in galʹilee and many other women who had come up together with him to jerusalem
42  now as it was already late in the afternoon and since it was preparation that is the day before the sabbath
43  there came joseph of arimatheʹa a reputable member of the council who also himself was waiting for the kingdom of god
he took courage and went in before pilate and asked for the body of jesus
44  but pilate wondered whether he could already be dead and summoning the army officer he asked him whether jesus had already died
45  so after making certain from the army officer he granted the body to joseph
46  after he bought fine linen and took him down he wrapped him in the fine linen and laid him in a tomb that was quarried out of rock then he rolled a stone up to the entrance of the tomb
47  but mary magʹdalene and mary the mother of joʹses continued looking at where he had been laid
1  the beginning of the good news about jesus christ the son of god
2  just as it is written in isaiah the prophet look i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way
3  a voice of one crying out in the wilderness prepare the way of jehovah make his roads straight
4  john the baptizer was in the wilderness preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins
5  and all the territory of judeʹa and all the inhabitants of jerusalem were going out to him and they were baptized by him in the jordan river openly confessing their sins
6  now john wore clothing of camels hair and a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey
7  and he was preaching someone stronger than i am is coming after me the lace of whose sandals i am not worthy to stoop down and untie
8  i baptized you with water but he will baptize you with holy spirit
9  in the course of those days jesus came from nazʹareth of galʹilee and was baptized in the jordan by john
10  and immediately on coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being parted and like a dove the spirit coming down upon him
11  and a voice came out of the heavens you are my son the beloved i have approved you
12  and immediately the spirit impelled him to go into the wilderness
13  so he continued in the wilderness for 40 days being tempted by satan
he was with the wild beasts but the angels were ministering to him
14  now after john was arrested jesus went into galʹilee preaching the good news of god
15  and saying the appointed time has been fulfilled and the kingdom of god has drawn near
repent and have faith in the good news
16  while walking alongside the sea of galʹilee he saw simon and simons brother andrew casting their nets into the sea for they were fishermen
17  so jesus said to them come after me and i will make you fishers of men
18  and at once they abandoned their nets and followed him
19  after going a little farther he saw james the son of zebʹedee and his brother john while they were in their boat mending their nets
20  and without delay he called them
so they left their father zebʹedee in the boat with the hired men and went off after him
21  and they went into caperʹnaum
as soon as the sabbath began he went into the synagogue and started to teach
22  and they were astounded at his way of teaching for he was teaching them as one having authority and not as the scribes
23  just then there was a man in their synagogue who was under the power of an unclean spirit and he shouted
24  what have we to do with you jesus the nazareneʹ did you come to destroy us i know exactly who you are the holy one of god
25  but jesus rebuked it saying be silent and come out of him
26  and the unclean spirit after throwing the man into a convulsion and yelling at the top of its voice came out of him
27  well the people were all so astonished that they began to discuss it among themselves saying what is this a new teaching he authoritatively orders even the unclean spirits and they obey him
28  so the report about him spread quickly in all directions throughout the entire region of galʹilee
29  at that they left the synagogue and went to the home of simon and andrew with james and john
30  now simons motherinlaw was lying down sick with a fever and they at once told him about her
31  going to her he took her by the hand and raised her up
the fever left her and she began ministering to them
32  after evening had fallen when the sun had set the people began bringing to him all who were ill and demon possessed
33  and the whole city was gathered right at the door
34  so he cured many who were ill with various sicknesses and he expelled many demons but he would not let the demons speak for they knew him to be christ
35  early in the morning while it was still dark he got up and went outside and left for an isolated place and there he began praying
36  however simon and those with him hunted him down
37  and found him and they said to him everyone is looking for you
38  but he said to them let us go somewhere else into the towns nearby so that i may preach there also for this is why i have come
39  and he went preaching in their synagogues throughout the whole of galʹilee and expelling the demons
40  there also came to him a leper pleading with him even on bended knee saying to him if you just want to you can make me clean
41  at that he was moved with pity and he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him i want to be made clean
42  immediately the leprosy vanished from him and he became clean
43  then he gave him strict orders and at once sent him away
44  saying to him see that you say nothing to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things moses directed for a witness to them
45  but after going away the man started to proclaim it a great deal and to spread the account widely so that jesus was no longer able to enter openly into a city but he stayed outside in isolated places
yet they kept coming to him from all sides
2  however after some days he again entered into caperʹnaum and the word spread that he was at home
2  and so many gathered that there was no more room not even around the door and he began to speak the word to them
3  and they brought him a paralytic carried by four men
4  but they could not bring him right to jesus because of the crowd so they removed the roof above jesus and after digging an opening they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying
5  when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic child your sins are forgiven
6  now some of the scribes were there sitting and reasoning in their hearts
7  why is this man talking this way he is blaspheming
who can forgive sins except one god
8  but immediately jesus discerned by his spirit that they were reasoning that way among themselves so he said to them why are you reasoning these things in your hearts
9  which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say get up and pick up your stretcher and walk
10  but in order for you to know that the son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth he said to the paralytic
11  i say to you get up pick up your stretcher and go to your home
12  at that he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and walked out in front of them all
so they were all astonished and they glorified god saying we have never seen anything like this
13  again he went out alongside the sea and all the crowd kept coming to him and he began to teach them
14  and as he was passing by he caught sight of leʹvi the son of alphaeʹus sitting at the tax office and he said to him be my follower
at that he rose up and followed him
15  later he was dining in his house and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with jesus and his disciples for there were many of them who were following him
16  but when the scribes of the pharisees saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors they began saying to his disciples does he eat with tax collectors and sinners
17  on hearing this jesus said to them those who are strong do not need a physician but those who are ill do
i came to call not righteous people but sinners
18  now johns disciples and the pharisees practiced fasting
so they came and said to him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not practice fasting
19  so jesus said to them while the bridegroom is with them the friends of the bridegroom have no reason to fast do they as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast
20  but days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast on that day
21  nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old outer garment
if he does the new piece pulls away from the old and the tear becomes worse
22  also no one puts new wine into old wineskins
if he does the wine will burst the skins and the wine is lost as well as the skins
but new wine is put into new wineskins
23  now as he was passing through the grainfields on the sabbath his disciples started to pluck the heads of grain as they went
24  so the pharisees said to him look here why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath
25  but he said to them have you never read what david did when he was in need and he and the men with him were hungry
26  how in the account about abiʹathar the chief priest he entered into the house of god and ate the loaves of presentation which it is not lawful for anybody to eat except the priests and he also gave some to the men who were with him
27  then he said to them the sabbath came into existence for the sake of man and not man for the sake of the sabbath
28  so the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
3  once again he entered into a synagogue and a man with a withered hand was there
2  so they were watching him closely to see whether he would cure the man on the sabbath in order to accuse him
3  he said to the man with the withered hand get up and come to the center
4  next he said to them is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm to save a life or to kill but they kept silent
5  after looking around at them with indignation being thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts he said to the man stretch out your hand
and he stretched it out and his hand was restored
6  at that the pharisees went out and immediately began holding council with the party followers of herod against him in order to kill him
7  but jesus departed for the sea along with his disciples and a great multitude from galʹilee and from judeʹa followed him
8  even from jerusalem and from idumeʹa and from across the jordan and from around tyre and siʹdon a great multitude came to him when they heard about the many things he was doing
9  and he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that the crowd would not press in on him
10  because he cured many all those who had serious diseases were crowding around him to touch him
11  even the unclean spirits whenever they saw him would fall down before him and cry out and say you are the son of god
12  but many times he sternly ordered them not to make him known
13  he ascended a mountain and summoned those whom he wanted and they came to him
14  and he formed a group of 12 whom he also named apostles those who were to accompany him and whom he would send out to preach
15  and to have authority to expel demons
16  and the group of 12 that he formed were simon to whom he also gave the name peter
17  james the son of zebʹedee and john the brother of james he also gave these the name boanerʹges which means sons of thunder
18  andrew philip bartholʹomew matthew thomas james the son of alphaeʹus thaddaeʹus simon the cananaeʹan
19  and judas iscarʹiot who later betrayed him
then he went into a house
20  and again the crowd gathered so that they were not able even to eat a meal
21  but when his relatives heard about it they went out to seize him for they were saying he has gone out of his mind
22  also the scribes who came down from jerusalem were saying he has beelʹzebub and he expels the demons by means of the ruler of the demons
23  so after calling them to him he spoke to them with illustrations how can satan expel satan
24  if a kingdom becomes divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand
25  and if a house becomes divided against itself that house will not be able to stand
26  also if satan has risen up against himself and has become divided he cannot stand but is coming to an end
27  in fact no one who enters the house of a strong man is able to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man
only then can he plunder his house
28  truly i say to you that all things will be forgiven the sons of men no matter what sins they commit and what blasphemies they speak
29  but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever but is guilty of everlasting sin
30  he said this because they were saying he has an unclean spirit
31  now his mother and his brothers came and standing outside they sent someone in to call him
32  as there was a crowd sitting around him they said to him look your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you
33  but he replied to them who are my mother and my brothers
34  then he looked at those sitting around him in a circle and said see my mother and my brothers
35  whoever does the will of god this one is my brother and sister and mother
12  then he started to speak to them with illustrations a man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a vat for the winepress and erected a tower then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad
2  in due season he sent a slave to the cultivators to collect some of the fruits of the vineyard from them
3  but they took him beat him and sent him away emptyhanded
4  again he sent another slave to them and that one they struck on the head and dishonored
5  and he sent another and that one they killed and many others some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed
6  one more he had a beloved son
he sent him to them last saying they will respect my son
7  but those cultivators said among themselves this is the heir
come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours
8  so they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard
9  what will the owner of the vineyard do he will come and kill the cultivators and will give the vineyard to others
10  did you never read this scripture the stone that the builders rejected this has become the chief cornerstone
11  this has come from jehovah and it is marvelous in our eyes
12  at that they wanted to seize him but they feared the crowd for they knew that he spoke the illustration with them in mind
so they left him and went away
13  next they sent to him some of the pharisees and of the party followers of herod in order to catch him in his speech
14  on arriving these said to him teacher we know you are truthful and you do not seek anyones favor for you do not look at the outward appearance of people but you teach the way of god in line with truth
is it lawful to pay head tax to caesar or not
15  should we pay or should we not pay detecting their hypocrisy he said to them why do you put me to the test bring me a denarʹius to look at
16  they brought one and he said to them whose image and inscription is this they said to him caesars
17  jesus then said pay back caesars things to caesar but gods things to god
and they were amazed at him
18  now the sadducees who say there is no resurrection came and asked him
19  teacher moses wrote us that if someones brother dies and leaves a wife behind but does not leave a child his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother
20  there were seven brothers
the first took a wife but when he died he left no offspring
21  and the second married her but died without leaving offspring and the third the same way
22  and all seven left no offspring
last of all the woman also died
23  in the resurrection whose wife will she be for the seven had her as a wife
24  jesus said to them is not this why you are mistaken because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god
25  for when they rise from the dead neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage but they are as angels in the heavens
26  but concerning the dead being raised up have you not read in the book of moses in the account about the thornbush that god said to him i am the god of abraham and god of isaac and god of jacob
27  he is a god not of the dead but of the living
you are very much mistaken
28  one of the scribes who had come up and heard them disputing knowing that he had answered them in a fine way asked him which commandment is first of all
29  jesus answered the first is hear o israel jehovah our god is one jehovah
30  and you must love jehovah your god with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength
31  the second is this you must love your neighbor as yourself
there is no other commandment greater than these
32  the scribe said to him teacher you spoke well in line with truth he is one and there is no other besides him
33  and to love him with ones whole heart with ones whole understanding and with ones whole strength and to love ones neighbor as oneself is worth far more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
34  at this jesus discerning that he had answered intelligently said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god
but no one had the courage to question him anymore
35  however as jesus continued teaching in the temple he said how is it that the scribes say that the christ is davids son
36  by the holy spirit david himself said jehovah said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies beneath your feet
37  david himself calls him lord so how can it be that he is his son and the large crowd was listening to him with pleasure
38  and in his teaching he went on to say beware of the scribes who want to walk around in robes and want greetings in the marketplaces
39  and front seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals
40  they devour the houses of the widows and for show they make long prayers
these will receive a more severe judgment
41  and he sat down with the treasury chests in view and began observing how the crowd was dropping money into the treasury chests and many rich people were dropping in many coins
42  now a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins of very little value
43  so he called his disciples to him and said to them truly i say to you that this poor widow put in more than all the others who put money into the treasury chests
44  for they all put in out of their surplus but she out of her want put in everything she had all she had to live on
