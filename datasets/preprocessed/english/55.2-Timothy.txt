4  i solemnly charge you before god and christ jesus who is to judge the living and the dead and by his manifestation and his kingdom
2  preach the word be at it urgently in favorable times and difficult times reprove reprimand exhort with all patience and art of teaching
3  for there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching but according to their own desires they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled
4  they will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories
5  you though keep your senses in all things endure hardship do the work of an evangelizer fully accomplish your ministry
6  for i am already being poured out like a drink offering and the time for my releasing is imminent
7  i have fought the fine fight i have run the race to the finish i have observed the faith
8  from this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me as a reward in that day yet not to me only but also to all those who have loved his manifestation
9  do your utmost to come to me shortly
10  for deʹmas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things and he has gone to thessaloniʹca cresʹcens to galaʹtia titus to dalmaʹtia
11  only luke is with me
bring mark along with you for he is helpful to me in the ministry
12  but i have sent tychʹicus off to ephʹesus
13  when you come bring the cloak i left at troʹas with carpus and the scrolls especially the parchments
14  alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm
jehovah will repay him according to his deeds
15  you too should be on guard against him for he opposed our message to an excessive degree
16  in my first defense no one came to my side but they all forsook memay they not be held accountable
17  but the lord stood near me and infused power into me so that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it and i was rescued from the lions mouth
18  the lord will rescue me from every wicked work and will save me for his heavenly kingdom
to him be the glory forever and ever
amen
19  give my greetings to prisʹca and aqʹuila and the household of onesiphʹorus
20  erasʹtus stayed in corinth but i left trophʹimus sick at mileʹtus
21  do your utmost to arrive before winter
eubuʹlus sends you his greetings and so do puʹdens and liʹnus and clauʹdia and all the brothers
22  the lord be with the spirit you show
his undeserved kindness be with you
1  paul an apostle of christ jesus by gods will according to the promise of the life that is through christ jesus
2  to timothy a beloved child may you have undeserved kindness mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
3  i am grateful to god to whom i am rendering sacred service as my forefathers did and with a clean conscience never ceasing to remember you in my supplications night and day
4  as i remember your tears i am longing to see you so that i may get filled with joy
5  for i recall your unhypocritical faith which dwelled first in your grandmother loʹis and your mother euʹnice but which i am confident is also in you
6  for this reason i remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of god that is in you through the laying of my hands on you
7  for god did not give us a spirit of cowardice but one of power and of love and of soundness of mind
8  so do not become ashamed either of the witness about our lord or of me a prisoner for his sake but take your part in suffering adversity for the good news by relying on the power of god
9  he saved us and called us with a holy calling not because of our works but because of his own purpose and undeserved kindness
this was given to us in connection with christ jesus before times long ago
10  but now it has been made clearly evident through the manifestation of our savior christ jesus who has abolished death and has shed light on life and incorruption through the good news
11  for which i was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher
12  this is why i am also suffering these things but i am not ashamed
for i know the one whom i have believed and i am confident that he is able to guard what i have laid up in trust with him until that day
13  keep holding to the standard of wholesome words that you heard from me with the faith and love that result from union with christ jesus
14  guard this fine trust by means of the holy spirit which is dwelling in us
15  you know this that all the men in the province of asia have turned away from me including phygelʹus and hermogʹenes
16  may the lord grant mercy to the household of onesiphʹorus for he often refreshed me and he did not become ashamed of my prison chains
17  on the contrary when he was in rome he diligently looked for me and found me
18  may the lord grant him to find mercy from jehovah in that day
and you well know all the services he rendered in ephʹesus
2  you therefore my child keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in christ jesus
2  and the things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses these things entrust to faithful men who in turn will be adequately qualified to teach others
3  as a fine soldier of christ jesus take your part in suffering adversity
4  no man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier
5  and even in the games anyone who competes is not crowned unless he has competed according to the rules
6  the hardworking farmer must be the first to partake of the fruits
7  give constant thought to what i am saying the lord will give you understanding in all things
8  remember that jesus christ was raised up from the dead and was davids offspring according to the good news i preach
9  for which i am suffering and being imprisoned as a criminal
nevertheless the word of god is not bound
10  for this reason i go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones so that they too may obtain the salvation that is through christ jesus along with everlasting glory
11  this saying is trustworthy certainly if we died together we will also live together
12  if we go on enduring we will also rule together as kings if we deny he will also deny us
13  if we are unfaithful he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself
14  keep reminding them of these things instructing them before god not to fight about words something of no usefulness at all because it harms those listening
15  do your utmost to present yourself approved to god a workman with nothing to be ashamed of handling the word of the truth aright
16  but reject empty speeches that violate what is holy for they will lead to more and more ungodliness
17  and their word will spread like gangrene
hymenaeʹus and phileʹtus are among them
18  these men have deviated from the truth saying that the resurrection has already occurred and they are subverting the faith of some
19  despite that the solid foundation of god remains standing having this seal jehovah knows those who belong to him and let everyone calling on the name of jehovah renounce unrighteousness
20  now in a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware and some for an honorable use but others for a use lacking honor
21  so if anyone keeps clear of the latter ones he will be an instrument for an honorable use sanctified useful to his owner prepared for every good work
22  so flee from youthful desires but pursue righteousness faith love peace along with those who call on the lord out of a clean heart
23  further reject foolish and ignorant debates knowing that they produce fights
24  for a slave of the lord does not need to fight but needs to be gentle toward all qualified to teach showing restraint when wronged
25  instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed
perhaps god may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth
26  and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil seeing that they have been caught alive by him to do his will
3  but know this that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here
2  for men will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boastful haughty blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful disloyal
3  having no natural affection not open to any agreement slanderers without selfcontrol fierce without love of goodness
4  betrayers headstrong puffed up with pride lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of god
5  having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power and from these turn away
6  from among these arise men who slyly work their way into households and captivate weak women loaded down with sins led by various desires
7  always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth
8  now in the way that janʹnes and jamʹbres opposed moses so these also go on opposing the truth
such men are completely corrupted in mind disapproved as regards the faith
9  nevertheless they will make no further progress for their folly will be very plain to all as it was with those two men
10  but you have closely followed my teaching my course of life my purpose my faith my patience my love my endurance
11  the persecutions and sufferings such as i experienced in antioch in icoʹnium in lysʹtra
i endured these persecutions and the lord rescued me from them all
12  in fact all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with christ jesus will also be persecuted
13  but wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse misleading and being misled
14  you however continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe knowing from whom you learned them
15  and that from infancy you have known the holy writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in christ jesus
16  all scripture is inspired of god and beneficial for teaching for reproving for setting things straight for disciplining in righteousness
17  so that the man of god may be fully competent completely equipped for every good work
