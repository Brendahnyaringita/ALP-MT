10  after abimʹelech toʹla the son of puʹah the son of doʹdo a man of isʹsachar rose up to save israel
he lived in shaʹmir in the mountainous region of eʹphraim
2  he judged israel for 23 years
then he died and was buried in shaʹmir
3  after him jaʹir the gilʹeadite rose up and judged israel for 22 years
4  he had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys and they had 30 cities which to this day are called havʹvothjaʹir they are in the land of gilʹead
5  after that jaʹir died and was buried in kaʹmon
6  again the israelites did what was bad in the eyes of jehovah and they began to serve the baʹals the ashʹtoreth images the gods of aʹram the gods of siʹdon the gods of moʹab the gods of the amʹmonites and the gods of the philisʹtines
they abandoned jehovah and did not serve him
7  then jehovahs anger blazed against israel and he sold them into the hands of the philisʹtines and the amʹmonites
8  so they crushed and greatly oppressed the israelites in that yearfor 18 years they oppressed all the israelites on the side of the jordan that had been the land of the amʹorites in gilʹead
9  the amʹmonites would also cross the jordan to fight against judah and benjamin and the house of eʹphraim and israel was greatly distressed
10  then the israelites called to jehovah for help saying we have sinned against you for we abandoned our god and served the baʹals
11  but jehovah said to the israelites did i not save you from egypt and from the amʹorites the amʹmonites the philisʹtines
12  the sidoʹnians amʹalek and midʹian when they oppressed you when you cried out to me i saved you out of their hand
13  but you abandoned me and served other gods
that is why i will not save you again
14  go to the gods whom you have chosen and call for help
let them save you in your time of distress
15  but the israelites said to jehovah we have sinned
do to us whatever is good in your eyes
only save us please this day
16  and they removed the foreign gods from their midst and served jehovah so that he could no longer tolerate israels suffering
17  in time the amʹmonites were called together and they pitched camp in gilʹead
so the israelites gathered together and pitched camp in mizʹpah
18  the people and the princes of gilʹead said to one another who will take the lead in fighting against the amʹmonites let him become the chief over all the inhabitants of gilʹead
4  but after eʹhud died the israelites again did what was bad in jehovahs eyes
2  so jehovah sold them into the hand of jaʹbin the king of caʹnaan who reigned in haʹzor
the chief of his army was sisʹera who lived in haroʹsheth of the nations
3  the israelites cried out to jehovah because jaʹbin had 900 war chariots with iron scythes and he harshly oppressed the israelites for 20 years
4  now debʹorah a prophetess the wife of lapʹpidoth was judging israel at that time
5  she used to sit under debʹorahs palm tree between raʹmah and bethʹel in the mountainous region of eʹphraim the israelites would go up to her for judgment
6  she sent for baʹrak the son of abinʹoam out of keʹdeshnaphʹtali and said to him has not jehovah the god of israel given the command go and march to mount taʹbor and take 10000 men of naphʹtali and zebʹulun with you
7  i will bring to you sisʹera the chief of jaʹbins army along with his war chariots and his troops to the stream of kiʹshon and i will give him into your hand
8  at this baʹrak said to her if you go with me i will go but if you do not go with me i will not go
9  to this she said i will certainly go with you
however the campaign you are going on will not bring you glory for it will be into the hand of a woman that jehovah will give sisʹera
then debʹorah got up and went with baʹrak to keʹdesh
10  baʹrak summoned zebʹulun and naphʹtali to keʹdesh and 10000 men followed his steps
debʹorah also went up with him
11  incidentally heʹber the kenʹite had separated from the kenʹites the descendants of hoʹbab moses fatherinlaw and his tent was pitched near the big tree in zaananʹnim which is at keʹdesh
12  they reported to sisʹera that baʹrak the son of abinʹoam had gone up to mount taʹbor
13  at once sisʹera assembled all his war chariots900 chariots with iron scythesand all the troops that were with him from haroʹsheth of the nations to go to the stream of kiʹshon
14  debʹorah now said to baʹrak rise up for this is the day that jehovah will give sisʹera into your hand
is jehovah not going out before you and baʹrak descended from mount taʹbor with 10000 men following him
15  then jehovah threw sisʹera and all his war chariots and all the army into confusion before the sword of baʹrak
finally sisʹera got down from his chariot and fled on foot
16  baʹrak chased after the war chariots and the army as far as haroʹsheth of the nations
so sisʹeras whole army fell by the sword not even one remained
17  but sisʹera fled on foot to the tent of jaʹel the wife of heʹber the kenʹite for there was peace between jaʹbin the king of haʹzor and the house of heʹber the kenʹite
18  then jaʹel came out to meet sisʹera and said to him come in my lord come in here
do not be afraid
so he went into her tent and she covered him with a blanket
19  then he said to her give me please a little water to drink for i am thirsty
so she opened a skin bottle of milk and gave him a drink after which she again covered him
20  he told her stand at the entrance of the tent and if anybody comes and asks you is there a man here say no
21  but jaʹel the wife of heʹber took a tent pin and a hammer in her hand
then while he was fast asleep and exhausted she stealthily approached him and drove the pin through his temples and beat it into the ground and he died
22  baʹrak went there in pursuit of sisʹera and jaʹel now came out to meet him and said come and i will show you the man you are looking for
he went in with her and saw sisʹera lying dead with the tent pin through his temples
23  so on that day god subdued jaʹbin the king of caʹnaan before the israelites
24  the hand of the israelites came down harder and harder against jaʹbin the king of caʹnaan until they destroyed jaʹbin the king of caʹnaan
11  now jephʹthah the gilʹeadite was a mighty warrior he was the son of a prostitute and gilʹead was jephʹthahs father
2  but gilʹeads wife also bore him sons
when the sons of his wife grew up they drove jephʹthah out and said to him you will have no inheritance in our fathers household for you are the son of another woman
3  so jephʹthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of tob
and idle men joined company with jephʹthah and they followed him
4  after a while the amʹmonites fought against israel
5  and when the amʹmonites fought against israel the elders of gilʹead immediately went to bring jephʹthah back from the land of tob
6  they said to jephʹthah come and serve as our commander so that we can fight against the amʹmonites
7  but jephʹthah said to the elders of gilʹead was it not you who hated me so much that you drove me out of my fathers house why have you come to me now when you are in distress
8  at this the elders of gilʹead said to jephʹthah that is why now we have returned to you
if you go with us and fight against the amʹmonites you will become our leader over all the inhabitants of gilʹead
9  so jephʹthah said to the elders of gilʹead if you bring me back to fight against the amʹmonites and jehovah defeats them for me then i will indeed become your leader
10  the elders of gilʹead said to jephʹthah let jehovah be the witness between us if we do not do as you say
11  so jephʹthah went with the elders of gilʹead and the people made him their leader and commander
and jephʹthah repeated all his words before jehovah in mizʹpah
12  jephʹthah then sent messengers to the king of the amʹmonites saying what do you have against me that you have come to attack my land
13  so the king of the amʹmonites said to the messengers of jephʹthah it is because israel took my land when they came up out of egypt from the arʹnon to the jabʹbok and as far as the jordan
now return it peaceably
14  but jephʹthah sent messengers back to the king of the amʹmonites
15  to say to him this is what jephʹthah says israel did not take the land of the moʹabites and the land of the amʹmonites
16  for when they came up out of egypt israel walked through the wilderness as far as the red sea and came to kaʹdesh
17  then israel sent messengers to the king of eʹdom saying please let us pass through your land but the king of eʹdom did not listen
also to the king of moʹab they sent word but he did not consent
so israel kept dwelling in kaʹdesh
18  when they walked through the wilderness they bypassed the land of eʹdom and the land of moʹab
they traveled east of the land of moʹab and camped in the region of the arʹnon they did not come within the boundary of moʹab for the arʹnon was the boundary of moʹab
19  after that israel sent messengers to siʹhon king of the amʹorites king of heshʹbon and israel said to him please let us pass through your land to our own place
20  but siʹhon did not trust israel to cross through his territory so siʹhon gathered all his people together and encamped in jaʹhaz and fought against israel
21  at this jehovah the god of israel gave siʹhon and all his people into israels hand so that they defeated them and israel took possession of all the land of the amʹorites the inhabitants of that land
22  thus they took possession of all the territory of the amʹorites from the arʹnon to the jabʹbok and from the wilderness to the jordan
23  it was jehovah the god of israel who drove out the amʹorites from before his people israel and now would you drive them out
24  do you not possess whatever your god cheʹmosh gives you to possess so everyone whom jehovah our god has driven out from before us is the one we will drive out
25  now are you any better than baʹlak the son of zipʹpor the king of moʹab did he ever contend with israel or did he ever fight against them
26  while israel was dwelling in heshʹbon and its dependent towns and in aroʹer and its dependent towns and in all the cities that are by the banks of the arʹnon for 300 years why did you never try to take them back during that time
27  i have not sinned against you but you are wrong to attack me
let jehovah the judge be judge today between the people of israel and the people of amʹmon
28  but the king of the amʹmonites would not listen to the message that jephʹthah sent to him
29  jehovahs spirit came upon jephʹthah and he passed through gilʹead and manasʹseh to go to mizʹpeh of gilʹead and from mizʹpeh of gilʹead he continued on to the amʹmonites
30  then jephʹthah made a vow to jehovah and said if you give the amʹmonites into my hand
31  then whoever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the amʹmonites will become jehovahs and i will offer that one up as a burnt offering
32  so jephʹthah went to fight against the amʹmonites and jehovah gave them into his hand
33  he struck them down with a very great slaughter from aroʹer all the way to minʹnith20 citiesand as far as aʹbelkerʹamim
thus the amʹmonites were subdued before the israelites
34  finally jephʹthah came to his home in mizʹpah and look his daughter was coming out to meet him playing the tambourine and dancing now she was his one and only child
besides her he had neither son nor daughter
35  when he saw her he ripped his garments and said oh no my daughter you have broken my heart for you have become the one i have banished
now i have opened my mouth to jehovah and i am unable to turn back
36  but she said to him my father if you have opened your mouth to jehovah do to me as you have promised since jehovah has executed vengeance for you upon your enemies the amʹmonites
37  she then said to her father let this be done for me let me be alone for two months and let me go away into the mountains and let me weep over my virginity with my female companions
38  at this he said go so he sent her away for two months and she went to the mountains with her companions to weep over her virginity
39  at the end of two months she returned to her father after which he carried out the vow he had made regarding her
she never had relations with a man
and it became a custom in israel
40  from year to year the young women of israel would go to give commendation to the daughter of jephʹthah the gilʹeadite four days in the year
8  then the men of eʹphraim said to him what have you done to us why did you not call us when you went to fight against midʹian and they quarreled bitterly with him
2  but he said to them what have i done compared with you are not the gleanings of eʹphraim better than the grape harvest of abieʹzer
3  it was into your hand that god gave midʹians princes oʹreb and zeʹeb and what have i done compared with you when he spoke this way they calmed down
4  gidʹeon then came to the jordan and crossed it
he and the 300 men with him were tired but they kept up the pursuit
5  so he said to the men of sucʹcoth please give loaves of bread to the people following me for they are tired and i am chasing after zeʹbah and zalmunʹna the kings of midʹian
6  but the princes of sucʹcoth said are the palms of zeʹbah and zalmunʹna already in your hand so that we should give bread to your army
7  at this gidʹeon said just for that when jehovah gives zeʹbah and zalmunʹna into my hand i will give you a thrashing with the thorns and the briars of the wilderness
8  and he went up from there to penuʹel and made the same request but the men of penuʹel gave him the same answer as the men of sucʹcoth
9  so he said also to the men of penuʹel when i return in peace i will pull down this tower
10  now zeʹbah and zalmunʹna were in karʹkor with their armies about 15000 men
these were all who remained of the entire army of the easterners for 120000 men armed with swords had fallen
11  gidʹeon continued up by the way of the tent dwellers east of noʹbah and jogʹbehah and attacked the camp which was off guard
12  when zeʹbah and zalmunʹna fled he pursued and captured the two midʹianite kings zeʹbah and zalmunʹna throwing the whole camp into a panic
13  gidʹeon the son of joʹash then returned from the war by way of the pass that goes up to heʹres
14  en route he captured and interrogated a young man from sucʹcoth
so the young man wrote out for him the names of the princes and elders of sucʹcoth 77 men
15  with that he went to the men of sucʹcoth and said here are zeʹbah and zalmunʹna about whom you taunted me saying are the palms of zeʹbah and zalmunʹna already in your hand so that we should give bread to your exhausted men
16  then he took the elders of the city and with thorns and briars of the wilderness he taught the men of sucʹcoth a lesson
17  and he pulled down the tower of penuʹel and killed the men of the city
18  he asked zeʹbah and zalmunʹna what sort of men did you kill in taʹbor to this they said they were like you each one looked like the son of a king
19  at that he said they were my brothers the sons of my mother
as surely as jehovah lives if you had spared their lives i would not have to kill you
20  then he said to jeʹther his firstborn get up kill them
but the young man did not draw his sword he was afraid for he was still a young man
21  so zeʹbah and zalmunʹna said get up yourself and slay us for a man is judged by his mightiness
so gidʹeon got up and killed zeʹbah and zalmunʹna and took the crescentshaped ornaments that were on the necks of their camels
22  later the men of israel said to gidʹeon rule over us you and your son and your grandson as well for you saved us out of the hand of midʹian
23  but gidʹeon said to them i will not rule over you nor will my son rule over you
jehovah is the one who will rule over you
24  gidʹeon continued let me make one request of you that each of you give me a nose ring from his spoil
for they had gold nose rings because they were ishʹmaelites
25  they replied we will surely give them
with that they spread out a robe and each man threw a nose ring from his spoil on it
26  the weight of the gold nose rings that he had requested amounted to 1700 gold shekels besides the crescentshaped ornaments the pendants the purple wool garments worn by the kings of midʹian and the necklaces from the camels
27  gidʹeon made it into an ephʹod and exhibited it in his city ophʹrah and all israel committed spiritual prostitution with it there and it served as a snare to gidʹeon and to his household
28  thus midʹian was subdued before the israelites and they did not challenge them again and the land had rest for 40 years in the days of gidʹeon
29  so jerubbaʹal the son of joʹash returned to his home and stayed there
30  gidʹeon became father to 70 sons for he had many wives
31  his concubine in sheʹchem also bore him a son and he named him abimʹelech
32  and gidʹeon the son of joʹash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of joʹash his father in ophʹrah of the abiezʹrites
33  as soon as gidʹeon died the israelites again committed spiritual prostitution with the baʹals and they appointed baʹalbeʹrith as their god
34  the israelites did not remember jehovah their god who had rescued them from the hand of all their enemies around them
35  nor did they show loyal love toward the household of jerubbaʹal that is gidʹeon in return for all the good that he had done for israel
16  one time samson went to gazʹa and saw a prostitute there and he went in to her
2  the gazʹites were told samson has come here
so they surrounded him and lay in ambush for him all night long in the city gate
they stayed quiet the whole night saying to themselves when daylight comes we will kill him
3  however samson kept lying there until midnight
then he got up at midnight and grabbed the doors of the city gate and the two side posts and pulled them out along with the bar
he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that faces hebʹron
4  after that he fell in love with a woman in the valley of soʹrek whose name was deliʹlah
5  so the lords of the philisʹtines approached her and said trick him and find out what gives him such great strength and how we can overpower him and tie him and subdue him
for this we will each give you 1100 silver pieces
6  deliʹlah later said to samson please tell me where your great power comes from and what can be used to tie you and subdue you
7  samson said to her if they tie me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried out i will grow as weak as an ordinary man
8  so the lords of the philisʹtines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried out and she tied him with them
9  now they set an ambush in the inner room and she called out to him the philisʹtines are upon you samson at that he tore apart the bowstrings just as easily as a thread of flax comes apart when it touches fire
the secret of his power did not become known
10  then deliʹlah said to samson look you have fooled me and told me lies
now tell me please what can be used to tie you
11  so he said to her if they tie me up with new ropes that have not been used for work i will grow as weak as an ordinary man
12  so deliʹlah took new ropes and tied him with them and called out the philisʹtines are upon you samson all the while the ambush was set in the inner room
at that he tore them off his arms like threads
13  after that deliʹlah said to samson up until now you have fooled me and told me lies
tell me what can be used to tie you
then he said to her if you weave the seven braids of my head with the warp thread
14  so she fixed them with a pin and called out to him the philisʹtines are upon you samson so he woke up from his sleep and pulled out the loom pin and the warp thread
15  she now said to him how can you say i love you when your heart is not with me these three times you have fooled me and have not told me the source of your great power
16  because day after day she kept nagging him and pressuring him he was weary to the point of dying
17  so he finally opened his heart to her saying a razor has never touched my head because i am a nazʹirite of god from birth
if i am shaved my power will leave me and i will grow weak and become like all other men
18  when deliʹlah saw that he had opened his heart to her she immediately summoned the philisʹtine lords saying come up this time for he has opened his heart to me
so the philisʹtine lords came up to her bringing the money with them
19  she made him fall asleep on her knees then she called the man and had him shave off the seven braids of his head
after that she began to have control over him for his power was leaving him
20  now she called out the philisʹtines are upon you samson he woke up from his sleep and said i will go out as at other times and shake myself free
but he did not know that jehovah had left him
21  so the philisʹtines seized him and bored his eyes out
then they brought him down to gazʹa and bound him with two copper fetters and he became a grinder of grain in the prison
22  but the hair of his head started to grow back again after he had been shaved
23  the philisʹtine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to daʹgon their god and to celebrate for they were saying our god has given samson our enemy into our hand
24  when the people saw him they praised their god and said our god has given into our hand our enemy the one who devastated our land and killed so many of us
25  because their heart was cheerful they said call samson to provide us some amusement
so they called samson out of the prison to entertain them they made him stand between the pillars
26  then samson said to the boy holding him by the hand let me feel the pillars that support the house so that i can lean against them
27  incidentally the house was full of men and women
all the philisʹtine lords were there and on the roof there were about 3000 men and women who were looking on while samson provided amusement
28  samson now called out to jehovah sovereign lord jehovah remember me please and strengthen me please just this once o god and let me take revenge on the philisʹtines for one of my two eyes
29  then samson braced himself against the two middle pillars that supported the house and he leaned on them with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other
30  samson called out let me die with the philisʹtines then he pushed with all his might and the house fell on the lords and all the people in it
so he killed more at his death than he had killed during his life
31  later his brothers and all his fathers family came down to take him back
they brought him up and buried him between zoʹrah and eshʹtaol in the tomb of manoʹah his father
he had judged israel for 20 years
18  in those days there was no king in israel
and in those days the tribe of the danʹites was looking for an inheritance to dwell in because until then they had not received an inheritance among the tribes of israel
2  the danʹites sent five men from among their family capable men from zoʹrah and eshʹtaol to spy out the land and to explore it
they said to them go explore the land
when they came to the mountainous region of eʹphraim to the house of miʹcah they spent the night there
3  while they were near the house of miʹcah they recognized the voice of the young levite man so they went over to him and asked who brought you here what are you doing in this place what is keeping you here
4  he replied to them thus and so miʹcah did for me and he hired me to serve as priest for him
5  then they said to him please ask god whether our journey will be successful
6  the priest said to them go in peace
jehovah is with you on your journey
7  so the five men went on and came to laʹish
they saw how the people in it were dwelling in selfreliance in the manner of the sidoʹnians
they were quiet and unsuspecting and no oppressive conqueror was in the land to disturb them
they were far away from the sidoʹnians and they had no dealings with anyone else
8  when they returned to their brothers at zoʹrah and eshʹtaol their brothers said to them how did it go
9  they replied let us go up against them for we have seen that the land is very good
why are you hesitant do not delay to go in to take possession of the land
10  when you arrive you will find an unsuspecting people and the land is spacious
god has given it into your hand a place where there is no lack of anything on the earth
11  then 600 men armed for battle from the family of the danʹites departed from zoʹrah and eshʹtaol
12  they went up and camped at kirʹiathjeʹarim in judah
that is why that place which is west of kirʹiathjeʹarim is called maʹhanehdan to this day
13  they went from there to the mountainous region of eʹphraim and came to the house of miʹcah
14  then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of laʹish said to their brothers did you know that there are in these houses an ephʹod teraphim statues a carved image and a metal statue think about what you should do
15  so they stopped there and came to the house of the young levite man at the house of miʹcah and asked how he was
16  all the while the 600 men of dan armed for battle stood at the entrance of the gate
17  the five men who had gone to spy out the land went inside to take the carved image the ephʹod the teraphim statues and the metal image
the priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed for battle
18  they went into the house of miʹcah and took the carved image the ephʹod the teraphim statues and the metal image
the priest said to them what are you doing
19  but they said to him be quiet
put your hand over your mouth and come with us to be a father and a priest for us
which is betterfor you to be a priest to the house of one man or to become a priest to a tribe and family in israel
20  so the priest was satisfied and he took the ephʹod the teraphim statues and the carved image and went off with the people
21  then they turned to go on their way putting the children the livestock and the valuable things ahead of them
22  they had gone some distance away from the house of miʹcah when the men who lived in the houses near the house of miʹcah gathered together and caught up with the danʹites
23  when they cried out to the danʹites they turned to face them and said to miʹcah what is the matter why have you been gathered together
24  so he said you have taken my gods that i made and you have gone off with the priest too
what do i have left how then can you ask me what is the matter with you
25  the danʹites replied do not raise your voice against us otherwise angry men may assault you and that would cost you your life and the lives of your household
26  so the danʹites went on their way and miʹcah seeing that they were stronger than he was turned and went back to his house
27  after they took what miʹcah had made as well as his priest they went to laʹish to a people quiet and unsuspecting
they struck them down with the sword and burned the city with fire
28  there was no one to rescue it for it was far from siʹdon and they had no dealings with anyone else and it was in the valley plain that belonged to bethreʹhob
then they rebuilt the city and settled in it
29  furthermore they named the city dan after the name of their father dan who was born to israel
but laʹish was the citys former name
30  after that the danʹites set up the carved image for themselves and jonʹathan the son of gerʹshom the son of moses and his sons became priests to the tribe of the danʹites until the day that the inhabitants of the land went into exile
31  and they set up the carved image that miʹcah had made and it remained there all the days that the house of the true god was in shiʹloh
17  there was a man of the mountainous region of eʹphraim named miʹcah
2  he said to his mother the 1100 silver pieces that were taken from you about which you pronounced a curse which i heardlook the silver is with me
i was the one who took it
at that his mother said may jehovah bless my son
3  so he gave the 1100 pieces of silver back to his mother but his mother said i will without fail sanctify the silver to jehovah from my hand for my son to use in making a carved image and a metal statue
now i give it back to you
4  after he returned the silver to his mother his mother took 200 silver pieces and gave them to the silversmith
he made a carved image and a metal statue and they were put in miʹcahs house
5  this man miʹcah had a house of gods and he made an ephʹod and teraphim statues and installed one of his sons to serve as priest for him
6  in those days there was no king in israel
each one was doing what was right in his own eyes
7  now there was a young man of bethʹlehem in judah who was of the family of judah
he was a levite who had been living there for a time
8  the man left the city of bethʹlehem in judah to find a place to live
while on his journey he came to the mountainous region of eʹphraim to the house of miʹcah
9  then miʹcah said to him where do you come from he replied i am a levite from bethʹlehem in judah and i am on my way to find a place to live
10  so miʹcah said to him stay with me and serve as a father and a priest for me
i will give you ten silver pieces a year and a set of garments and your food
so the levite went in
11  thus the levite agreed to stay with the man and the young man became like one of his sons
12  furthermore miʹcah installed the levite to serve as a priest for him and he lived in the house of miʹcah
13  then miʹcah said now i know that jehovah will be good to me for the levite has become my priest
9  in time abimʹelech the son of jerubbaʹal went to his mothers brothers in sheʹchem and he said to them and to all the family of his grandfather
2  please ask all the leaders of sheʹchem which is better for you for all 70 sons of jerubbaʹal to rule over you or for one man to rule over you and remember that i am your own bone and flesh
3  so his mothers brothers said this in his behalf to all the leaders of sheʹchem and their hearts were inclined to follow abimʹelech for they said he is our own brother
4  then they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the house of baʹalbeʹrith and abimʹelech used it to hire idle and insolent men to accompany him
5  after that he went to his fathers house at ophʹrah and killed his brothers the sons of jerubbaʹal 70 men on one stone
the only survivor was joʹtham the youngest son of jerubbaʹal because he hid
6  then all the leaders of sheʹchem and all bethmilʹlo gathered together and made abimʹelech king close by the big tree by the pillar that was in sheʹchem
7  when they reported it to joʹtham he at once went and stood on the top of mount gerʹizim and called out in a loud voice to them listen to me you leaders of sheʹchem and then god will listen to you
8  once there were trees that went to anoint a king over them
so they said to the olive tree rule over us
9  but the olive tree said to them must i give up my oil which they use to glorify god and men to go and wave over the other trees
10  then the trees said to the fig tree come and rule over us
11  but the fig tree said to them must i give up my sweetness and my good fruitage to go and wave over the other trees
12  next the trees said to the vine come and rule over us
13  the vine replied to them must i give up my new wine that makes god and men rejoice to go and wave over the trees
14  finally all the other trees said to the bramble come and rule over us
15  at this the bramble said to the trees if you are really anointing me as king over you come and seek refuge under my shadow
but if not let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of lebʹanon
16  now have you acted sincerely and honorably in making abimʹelech king and have you shown goodness toward jerubbaʹal and his household and have you treated him as he deserves
17  when my father fought for you he risked his life to save you from midʹians hand
18  but today you have risen up against my fathers household and killed his sons 70 men on one stone
then you made abimʹelech the son of his slave girl king over the leaders of sheʹchem just because he is your brother
19  yes if you are acting sincerely and honorably toward jerubbaʹal and his household this day rejoice over abimʹelech and let him also rejoice over you
20  but if not may fire come out of abimʹelech and consume the leaders of sheʹchem and bethmilʹlo and may fire come out of the leaders of sheʹchem and bethmilʹlo and consume abimʹelech
21  then joʹtham fled and escaped to beʹer and he lived there because of his brother abimʹelech
22  abimʹelech ruled over israel for three years
23  then god let hostility develop between abimʹelech and the leaders of sheʹchem and they dealt treacherously with abimʹelech
24  this was so that the violence done to the 70 sons of jerubbaʹal might be avenged so as to place responsibility for their blood on their brother abimʹelech for killing them and on the leaders of sheʹchem for helping him to kill his brothers
25  so the leaders of sheʹchem set men to ambush him on the mountaintops and they would rob everyone who passed by them on the road
in time it was reported to abimʹelech
26  then gaʹal son of eʹbed and his brothers crossed over into sheʹchem and the leaders of sheʹchem put their trust in him
27  they went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards trod them out and held a festival after which they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and cursed abimʹelech
28  then gaʹal the son of eʹbed said who is abimʹelech and who is sheʹchem that we should serve him is he not the son of jerubbaʹal and is not zeʹbul his commissioner serve the men of haʹmor sheʹchems father but why should we serve him
29  if only this people were under my command i would depose abimʹelech
then he said to abimʹelech increase your army and come out
30  when zeʹbul the prince of the city heard the words of gaʹal the son of eʹbed his anger blazed
31  so he secretly sent messengers to abimʹelech saying look gaʹal the son of eʹbed and his brothers are now in sheʹchem and here they are inciting the city against you
32  now come up by night you and your men and lie in wait in the field
33  as soon as the sun rises in the morning you should get up early and attack the city and when he and his men come out against you do whatever you can to defeat him
34  so abimʹelech and all the people with him rose up by night and in four bands they lay in wait against sheʹchem
35  when gaʹal the son of eʹbed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate abimʹelech and the people with him rose up from the ambush
36  when gaʹal saw the people he said to zeʹbul look there are people coming down from the mountaintops
but zeʹbul said to him you are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men
37  gaʹal later said look people are coming down from the center of the land and one band is coming by the way of the big tree of meonʹenim
38  zeʹbul replied to him where now is your boast who is abimʹelech that we should serve him are these not the people you rejected go out now and fight against them
39  so gaʹal went out at the head of the leaders of sheʹchem and fought against abimʹelech
40  abimʹelech pursued him and gaʹal fled from him and many fell slain as far as the entrance of the city gate
41  and abimʹelech continued to dwell in aruʹmah and zeʹbul drove gaʹal and his brothers out of sheʹchem
42  the next day the people went out into the field and abimʹelech was told about it
43  so he took the people and divided them into three bands and lay in wait in the field
when he saw the people going out of the city he attacked them and struck them down
44  abimʹelech and the bands with him charged forward and took a position at the entrance of the city gate while two bands attacked all who were in the field and they struck them down
45  abimʹelech fought against the city all that day and captured it
he killed the people in it and then he pulled the city down and sowed it with salt
46  when all the leaders of the tower of sheʹchem heard about this they immediately went to the vault of the house of elbeʹrith
47  as soon as it was reported to abimʹelech that all the leaders of the tower of sheʹchem had gathered together
48  abimʹelech and all the men with him went up mount zalʹmon
abimʹelech took an ax in his hand and cut off a tree branch and lifted it on his shoulder and said to the people with him what you saw me do hurry and do the same
49  so all the people also cut off branches and followed abimʹelech
then they put the branches against the vault and set the vault on fire
so all the people of the tower of sheʹchem also died about 1000 men and women
50  abimʹelech then went to theʹbez he camped against theʹbez and captured it
51  there was a strong tower in the middle of the city and all the men and women and all the city leaders fled there
they shut themselves in and climbed onto the roof of the tower
52  abimʹelech made his way to the tower and attacked it
he approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire
53  then one of the women dropped an upper millstone on abimʹelechs head and crushed his skull
54  he quickly called the attendant bearing his weapons and said to him draw your sword and put me to death so that they may not say about me a woman killed him
so his attendant ran him through and he died
55  when the men of israel saw that abimʹelech was dead they all went back home
56  thus god repaid abimʹelech for the evil that he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers
57  god also made all the evil of the men of sheʹchem come back on their own heads
so the curse of joʹtham the son of jerubbaʹal came upon them
7  then jerubbaʹal that is gidʹeon and all the people with him rose early and encamped at the spring of haʹrod while the camp of midʹian was north of him at the hill of moʹreh in the valley plain
2  jehovah now said to gidʹeon there are too many people with you for me to give midʹian into their hand
otherwise israel might brag about itself against me and say my own hand saved me
3  now please announce in the presence of the people whoever is afraid and trembling let him return home
so gidʹeon put them to the test
with that 22000 of the people returned home and 10000 remained
4  still jehovah said to gidʹeon there are yet too many people
have them go down to the water so that i may test them for you there
when i say to you this one will go with you he will go with you but when i say to you this one will not go along with you he will not go along
5  so he took the people down to the water
then jehovah said to gidʹeon separate everyone who laps up the water with his tongue just as a dog laps from those who bend down on their knees to drink
6  the number of those lapping up the water putting their hand to their mouth was 300 men
the rest of the people bent down on their knees to drink
7  jehovah now said to gidʹeon i will save you with the 300 men who lapped the water and i will give midʹian into your hand
but let all the other people go back home
8  so after they took the provisions and the horns from the people he sent all the other men of israel back home and he kept only the 300 men
the camp of midʹian was below him in the valley plain
9  during that night jehovah said to him get up attack the camp for i have given it into your hand
10  but if you are afraid to attack go down to the camp with puʹrah your attendant
11  listen to what they say and afterward you will have the courage to attack the camp
at that he and puʹrah his attendant went down to the edge of the encamped army
12  now midʹian and amʹalek and all the easterners covered the valley plain like a swarm of locusts and their camels were without number as many as the grains of sand on the seashore
13  gidʹeon now came and there was a man relating a dream to his companion and he said this is the dream i had
there was a round loaf of barley bread rolling into the camp of midʹian
it came to a tent and struck it so hard that it collapsed
yes it turned the tent upside down and the tent fell flat
14  at this his companion said this can only be the sword of gidʹeon the son of joʹash a man of israel
god has given midʹian and all the camp into his hand
15  as soon as gidʹeon heard him relate the dream and its interpretation he bowed down to worship
after that he returned to the camp of israel and said get up for jehovah has given the camp of midʹian into your hand
16  then he divided the 300 men into three bands and gave all of them horns and large empty jars with torches inside the jars
17  then he said to them watch me and do exactly what i do
when i come to the edge of the camp you should do just as i do
18  when i blow the horn i and all who are with me you also must blow the horns all around the camp and shout for jehovah and for gidʹeon
19  gidʹeon and the 100 men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the start of the middle night watch just after the sentries were posted
they blew the horns and smashed the large water jars that were in their hands
20  so the three bands blew the horns and shattered the large jars
they held the torches in their left hands and blew the horns in their right hands and they called out the sword of jehovah and of gidʹeon
21  all the while each man stood in his place all around the camp and the whole army ran away shouting as they fled
22  the 300 continued to blow the horns and jehovah turned the sword of each one against the other throughout the camp and the army fled as far as bethshitʹtah on to zerʹerah as far as the outskirts of aʹbelmehoʹlah by tabʹbath
23  and the men of israel were called together from naphʹtali ashʹer and all of manasʹseh and they chased after midʹian
24  gidʹeon sent messengers into all the mountainous region of eʹphraim saying go down to attack midʹian and capture the access to the waters as far as bethbarʹah and the jordan
so all the men of eʹphraim were gathered together and they captured the waters as far as bethbarʹah and the jordan
25  they also captured the two princes of midʹian oʹreb and zeʹeb they killed oʹreb on the rock of oʹreb and they killed zeʹeb at the winepress of zeʹeb
they kept on pursuing midʹian and they brought the heads of oʹreb and zeʹeb to gidʹeon in the region of the jordan
6  but the israelites again did what was bad in the eyes of jehovah so jehovah gave them into the hand of midʹian for seven years
2  the hand of midʹian dominated over israel
because of midʹian the israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains in the caves and in the places difficult to approach
3  if israel sowed seed midʹian and amʹalek and the easterners would attack them
4  they would camp against them and ruin the produce of the land all the way to gazʹa and they left nothing for israel to eat and no sheep or bull or donkey
5  for they would come up with their livestock and tents as numerous as the locusts and they and their camels could not be numbered and they would come into the land to destroy it
6  so israel became greatly impoverished on account of midʹian and the israelites called to jehovah for help
7  when the israelites called to jehovah for help because of midʹian
8  jehovah sent to the israelites a prophet who said to them this is what jehovah the god of israel says i brought you up from egypt and thus brought you out of the house of slavery
9  so i rescued you from the hand of egypt and from all your oppressors and drove them out from before you and gave you their land
10  and i said to you i am jehovah your god
you must not fear the gods of the amʹorites in whose land you are dwelling
but you did not obey me
11  later jehovahs angel came and sat under the big tree that was in ophʹrah which belonged to joʹash the abiezʹrite
his son gidʹeon was beating out wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from midʹian
12  jehovahs angel appeared to him and said jehovah is with you you mighty warrior
13  at this gidʹeon said to him pardon me my lord but if jehovah is with us why has all of this come upon us where are all his wonderful acts that our fathers related to us saying did jehovah not bring us up out of egypt now jehovah has deserted us and given us into midʹians hand
14  jehovah faced him and said go with the strength you have and you will save israel out of midʹians hand
is it not i who send you
15  gidʹeon answered him pardon me jehovah
how can i save israel look my clan is the least in manasʹseh and i am the most insignificant in my fathers house
16  but jehovah said to him because i will be with you you will strike down midʹian as if they were one man
17  then he said to him if now i have found favor in your eyes show me a sign that you are the one speaking with me
18  please do not depart from here until i return with my gift and set it before you
so he said i will stay here until you return
19  and gidʹeon went in and prepared a young goat and made unleavened bread from an eʹphah of flour
he put the meat in the basket and the broth in the cooking pot then he brought them out to him and served them under the big tree
20  the angel of the true god now said to him take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them on the big rock there and pour out the broth
and he did so
21  then jehovahs angel stretched out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread and fire flared up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread
jehovahs angel then vanished from his sight
22  gidʹeon now realized that it was jehovahs angel
at once gidʹeon said alas sovereign lord jehovah for i have seen jehovahs angel facetoface
23  but jehovah said to him peace be with you
have no fear you will not die
24  so gidʹeon built an altar there to jehovah and it is called jehoʹvahshaʹlom down to this day
it is still in ophʹrah of the abiezʹrites
25  that night jehovah said to him take the young bull that belongs to your father the second young bull that is seven years old and tear down the altar of baʹal that belongs to your father and cut down the sacred pole next to it
26  after you build an altar to jehovah your god on top of this stronghold with the row of stones take the second young bull and offer it as a burnt offering on the pieces of wood from the sacred pole that you cut down
27  so gidʹeon took ten men of his servants and did just as jehovah told him
but he feared the household of his father and the men of the city too much to do it by day so he did it at night
28  when the men of the city got up early the next morning they saw that the altar of baʹal had been pulled down and the sacred pole beside it had been cut down and the second young bull had been offered up on the altar that had been built
29  they asked one another who did this after they investigated they said gidʹeon the son of joʹash did this
30  so the men of the city said to joʹash bring your son out that he may die because he pulled down the altar of baʹal and cut down the sacred pole next to it
31  joʹash then said to all those who confronted him do you have to defend baʹal do you have to save him whoever defends him should be put to death this morning
if he is a god let him defend himself since someone pulled down his altar
32  and he called gidʹeon jerubbaʹal on that day saying let baʹal defend himself for someone has pulled down his altar
33  all midʹian and amʹalek and the easterners joined forces and they crossed over into the valley of jezʹreel and camped
34  then jehovahs spirit came upon gidʹeon and he sounded the horn and the abiezʹrites rallied behind him
35  he sent out messengers through all of manasʹseh and they too rallied behind him
he also sent out messengers through ashʹer zebʹulun and naphʹtali and they came up to meet him
36  then gidʹeon said to the true god if you are saving israel by means of me just as you have promised
37  here i am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor
if there is dew on the fleece only but all the ground around it is dry then i will know that you will save israel by means of me just as you have promised
38  and that is how it happened
when he rose up early the next day and wrung the fleece he squeezed off enough dew from the fleece to fill a large banquet bowl with water
39  however gidʹeon said to the true god do not let your anger burn against me but let me ask just once more
let me please make just one more test with the fleece
please let the fleece alone be dry while there is dew all over the ground
40  so that is what god did that night only the fleece was dry and there was dew all over the ground
21  now the men of israel had sworn this oath in mizʹpah not one of us will give his daughter to a man from benjamin as a wife
2  consequently the people came to bethʹel and sat there before the true god until evening crying out and weeping bitterly
3  and they were saying why o jehovah the god of israel has this happened in israel why should one tribe be missing today from israel
4  and the next day the people got up early and built an altar there to offer up burnt offerings and communion offerings
5  then the people of israel said who of all the tribes of israel did not come up to assemble before jehovah for they had taken a great oath that anyone who did not come up to jehovah at mizʹpah would be put to death without fail
6  so the people of israel felt sorrow over what had happened to benjamin their brother
they said today one tribe has been chopped off from israel
7  what should we do to provide wives for those who are left now that we have sworn by jehovah not to give them any of our daughters as wives
8  they asked who among the tribes of israel did not come up to jehovah at mizʹpah it so happened that no one had come from jaʹbeshgilʹead into the camp where the congregation was
9  when the people were counted they saw that none of the inhabitants of jaʹbeshgilʹead were there
10  so the assembly sent there 12000 of the mightiest men
they commanded them go and strike down the inhabitants of jaʹbeshgilʹead with the sword even the women and the children
11  this is what you should do every male as well as every woman who has had sexual relations with a male you should devote to destruction
12  among the inhabitants of jaʹbeshgilʹead they found 400 girls who were virgins who had never had sexual relations with a man
so they brought them to the camp at shiʹloh which is in the land of caʹnaan
13  then all the assembly sent a message to the benʹjaminites on the crag of rimʹmon and offered them peace
14  so benjamin came back at that time
they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of jaʹbeshgilʹead but they did not find enough for them
15  and the people felt sorrow over what had happened to benjamin because jehovah had made a division among the tribes of israel
16  the elders of the assembly said what should we do to provide wives for the remaining men since all the women were annihilated out of benjamin
17  they replied there should be an inheritance for the survivors of benjamin so that a tribe may not be wiped out of israel
18  but we are not allowed to give them wives from our daughters because the people of israel have sworn cursed is the one who gives a wife to benjamin
19  then they said look there is a festival of jehovah from year to year in shiʹloh which is north of bethʹel and east of the highway that goes up from bethʹel to sheʹchem and south of leboʹnah
20  so they commanded the men of benjamin go and set an ambush in the vineyards
21  and when you see the young women of shiʹloh come out to join in their circle dances each of you should come out from the vineyards and seize a wife from the young women of shiʹloh and you should return to the land of benjamin
22  and should their fathers or their brothers come to make a complaint against us we will then tell them show us favor for their sakes because we could not provide each one a wife by war and you could not give a wife to them without becoming guilty
23  so the men of benjamin did just that and they each carried off a wife from the women who were dancing
after that they went back to their inheritance and rebuilt their cities and settled in them
24  and the israelites dispersed from there at that time each one to his tribe and his family and they departed from there each one to his inheritance
25  in those days there was no king in israel
each one was doing what was right in his own eyes
13  again the israelites did what was bad in jehovahs eyes and jehovah gave them into the hand of the philisʹtines for 40 years
2  meanwhile there was a man of zoʹrah of the family of the danʹites whose name was manoʹah
his wife was barren and childless
3  in time jehovahs angel appeared to the woman and said to her look you are barren and childless
but you will conceive and give birth to a son
4  now be careful not to drink wine or anything alcoholic and do not eat anything unclean
5  look you will conceive and give birth to a son and no razor should touch his head because the child will be a nazʹirite of god from birth and he will take the lead in saving israel out of the hand of the philisʹtines
6  then the woman went and told her husband a man of the true god came to me and his appearance was like an angel of the true god very aweinspiring
i did not ask him where he was from nor did he tell me his name
7  but he said to me look you will conceive and give birth to a son
now do not drink wine or anything alcoholic and do not eat anything unclean because the child will be a nazʹirite of god from birth until the day of his death
8  manoʹah pleaded with jehovah and said pardon me jehovah
please let the man of the true god whom you just sent come again to instruct us about what we should do with the child who will be born
9  so the true god listened to manoʹah and the angel of the true god came again to the woman while she was sitting in the field her husband manoʹah was not with her
10  the woman quickly ran and told her husband look the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me
11  then manoʹah got up and went with his wife
he came to the man and said to him are you the man who spoke to my wife he said i am
12  then manoʹah said may your words come true what will be the childs manner of life and what will be his work
13  so jehovahs angel said to manoʹah your wife should keep herself from everything that i mentioned to her
14  she should not eat anything that the grapevine produces she should not drink wine or anything alcoholic and she should not eat anything unclean
everything that i commanded her let her observe
15  manoʹah now said to jehovahs angel please stay and let us prepare a young goat for you
16  but jehovahs angel said to manoʹah if i stay i will not eat your food but if you wish to present a burnt offering to jehovah you may offer it up
manoʹah did not know that he was jehovahs angel
17  then manoʹah said to jehovahs angel what is your name so that we may honor you when your word comes true
18  however jehovahs angel said to him why are you asking about my name seeing that it is a wonderful one
19  then manoʹah took the young goat and the grain offering and offered them on the rock to jehovah
and he was doing something amazing while manoʹah and his wife were looking on
20  as the flame ascended from the altar heavenward jehovahs angel ascended in the flame from the altar while manoʹah and his wife were looking on
at once they fell with their faces to the ground
21  jehovahs angel did not appear again to manoʹah and his wife
then manoʹah realized that he was jehovahs angel
22  manoʹah then said to his wife we are sure to die because it is god whom we have seen
23  but his wife said to him if jehovah wanted to put us to death he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hand he would not have shown us all these things and he would not have told us any of these things
24  the woman later gave birth to a son and named him samson and as the boy grew jehovah continued to bless him
25  in time jehovahs spirit started to impel him in maʹhanehdan between zoʹrah and eshʹtaol
14  then samson went down to timʹnah and in timʹnah he saw a philisʹtine woman
2  so he went up and told his father and mother in timʹnah a philisʹtine woman caught my eye and i want you to get her for me as a wife
3  but his father and mother said to him can you not find a woman among your relatives and among all our people must you go and take a wife from among the uncircumcised philisʹtines but samson said to his father get her for me because she is the right one for me
4  his father and mother did not realize that this was from jehovah for he was looking for an opportunity against the philisʹtines as the philisʹtines were ruling over israel at that time
5  so samson went down with his father and mother to timʹnah
when he reached the vineyards of timʹnah why look a lion came roaring at him
6  then jehovahs spirit empowered him and he tore it in two just as someone tears a young goat in two with his bare hands
but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done
7  then he went down and spoke to the woman and she was still the right one in samsons eyes
8  later when he was going back to take her home he turned aside to look at the dead body of the lion and there in the lions carcass was a swarm of bees and honey
9  so he scraped the honey out into his hands and ate it as he walked along
when he rejoined his father and mother he gave them some to eat
but he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the carcass of a lion
10  his father went down to the woman and samson held a banquet there for that was what the young men used to do
11  when they saw him they brought 30 groomsmen to accompany him
12  then samson said to them please let me tell you a riddle
if during the seven days of the banquet you solve it and tell me the answer i will have to give you 30 linen garments and 30 outfits of clothing
13  but if you are unable to tell me the answer you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 outfits of clothing
they said tell us your riddle we want to hear it
14  so he said to them out of the eater came something to eatand out of the strong came something sweet
they were unable to solve the riddle for three days
15  on the fourth day they said to samsons wife trick your husband so that he will tell us the answer to the riddle
otherwise we will burn you and your fathers house with fire
did you invite us here to take our possessions
16  so samsons wife wept over him and said you must hate me you do not love me
you told a riddle to my people but you have not told the answer to me
at this he said to her why i have not told it even to my own father and mother should i tell it to you
17  but she kept weeping over him the rest of the sevenday banquet
he finally told her on the seventh day because she had pressured him
then she told her people the answer to the riddle
18  so on the seventh day before the sun set the men of the city said to him what is sweeter than honeyand what is stronger than a lion he replied to them if you had not plowed with my young cowyou would not have solved my riddle
19  then jehovahs spirit empowered him and he went down to ashʹkelon and struck down 30 of their men and took their clothing and gave the outfits to those who had answered the riddle
he was furious as he went back up to his fathers house
20  samsons wife was then given to one of his groomsmen who had accompanied him
19  in those days when there was no king in israel a levite who was then living in a remote part of the mountainous region of eʹphraim took a concubine from bethʹlehem in judah as his wife
2  but his concubine was unfaithful to him and she left him to go to her fathers house at bethʹlehem in judah
she remained there for four months
3  then her husband went after her to persuade her to come back he had his male attendant and a couple of donkeys with him
so she brought him into her fathers house
when her father saw him he was glad to meet him
4  so his fatherinlaw the young womans father convinced him to stay with him three days and they would eat and drink and he would spend the night there
5  on the fourth day when they got up early in the morning to go the father of the young woman said to his soninlaw eat something to give you strength and then you may go
6  so they sat down and they both ate and drank together after that the father of the young woman said to the man please stay overnight and enjoy yourself
7  when the man rose to go his fatherinlaw kept begging him so he stayed overnight again
8  when he got up early in the morning on the fifth day to go the father of the young woman said please eat something to give you strength
and they lingered until it was late in the day and they both kept eating
9  when the man rose to go with his concubine and his attendant his fatherinlaw the young womans father said to him look now it is almost evening
please stay overnight
here the day is coming to an end
stay here overnight and enjoy yourself
tomorrow you can get up early for your journey and go to your home
10  however the man did not want to stay another night so he got up and traveled as far as jeʹbus that is jerusalem
he had with him the two saddled donkeys his concubine and his attendant
11  when they were close to jeʹbus the daylight was nearly gone
so the attendant said to his master should we stop at this city of the jebʹusites and stay overnight here
12  but his master said to him we should not stop at a city of foreigners who are not israelites
we will go on as far as gibʹeah
13  then he said to his attendant come and let us try to reach one of those places we will stay overnight either in gibʹeah or in raʹmah
14  so they went on their way and the sun began to set when they were near gibʹeah which belongs to benjamin
15  so they stopped there and went in to stay overnight in gibʹeah
once inside they sat down in the public square of the city but nobody took them into his house to stay overnight
16  eventually that evening an old man came in from his work in the field
he was from the mountainous region of eʹphraim and he was living for a time in gibʹeah but the residents of the city were benʹjaminites
17  when he looked up and saw the traveler in the public square of the city the old man said where are you going and where do you come from
18  he replied we are traveling from bethʹlehem in judah to a remote area of the mountainous region of eʹphraim where i am from
i went to bethʹlehem in judah and i am going to the house of jehovah but nobody is taking me into his house
19  we have enough straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for me the woman and our attendant
there is nothing lacking
20  however the old man said may you have peace let me take care of anything you need
just do not stay overnight in the public square
21  so he brought him into his house and gave feed to the donkeys
then they washed their feet and ate and drank
22  while they were enjoying themselves some worthless men of the city surrounded the house and were pounding on the door and they kept saying to the old man who owned the house bring out the man who came into your house so that we may have sex with him
23  at that the owner of the house went out and said to them no my brothers do not act wickedly
please this man is a guest in my house
do not commit this disgraceful act
24  here are my virgin daughter and this mans concubine
let me bring them out and you can humiliate them if you must
but you must not commit this disgraceful act toward this man
25  but the men refused to listen to him so the man grabbed hold of his concubine and brought her outside to them
they raped her and abused her all night long until the morning
then they sent her away at the break of dawn
26  early in the morning the woman came and fell down at the entrance of the mans house where her master was and lay there until it was light
27  when her master got up in the morning and opened the doors of the house to go out to resume his journey he saw the woman his concubine lying at the entrance of the house with her hands on the threshold
28  so he said to her get up let us go
but there was no answer
the man then put her on the donkey and set out for his home
29  when he reached his house he took the slaughtering knife and took hold of his concubine and cut her up limb by limb into 12 pieces and sent one piece into each territory of israel
30  all who saw it said such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the israelites went up out of the land of egypt down to this day
consider it take counsel and tell us what to do
5  on that day debʹorah along with baʹrak the son of abinʹoam sang this song
2  because of the unbound hair in israelbecause of the peoples volunteeringpraise jehovah
3  listen you kings give ear you rulers to jehovah i will sing
i will sing praises to jehovah israels god
4  jehovah when you went out from seʹirwhen you marched out of the territory of eʹdomthe earth shook and the heavens pouredthe clouds poured down water
5  mountains melted before the face of jehovaheven siʹnai before the face of jehovah israels god
6  in the days of shamʹgar the son of aʹnathin the days of jaʹel the roads were desertedtravelers kept to the back roads
7  the villagers in israel were no morethey were no more until i debʹorah rose upuntil i arose as a mother in israel
8  they chose new godsthen there was war in the gates
a shield could not be seen nor a lanceamong 40000 in israel
9  my heart is with the commanders of israelwho went as volunteers with the people
praise jehovah
10  you riders on tawny donkeysyou who sit on fine carpetsand you who walk on the roadconsider
11  the voices of the water distributors were heard at the watering placesthere they were recounting the righteous acts of jehovahthe righteous acts of his villagers in israel
then jehovahs people went down to the gates
12  awake awake o debʹorah awake awake sing a song rise up baʹrak lead your captives away you son of abinʹoam
13  then those who were left came down to the noblesjehovahs people came down to me against the mighty
14  out of eʹphraim was their origin those in the valleythey are following you o benjamin among your peoples
from maʹchir the commanders went downand from zebʹulun those who bear the recruiters staff
15  the princes in isʹsachar were with debʹorahas was isʹsachar so was baʹrak
into the valley plain he was sent on foot
among the divisions of reuʹben there was intense heartsearching
16  why did you sit down between the two saddlebagslistening to them playing their pipes for the flocks for the divisions of reuʹben there was intense heartsearching
17  gilʹead remained beyond the jordanand dan why did he stay with the ships ashʹer sat idle at the seashoreand by his harbors he remained
18  zebʹulun was a people who risked their lives to the point of deathnaphʹtali also on the open heights
19  kings came they foughtthe kings of caʹnaan then foughtin taʹanach by the waters of megidʹdo
no spoil of silver did they take
20  from heaven the stars foughtfrom their orbits they fought against sisʹera
21  the torrent of kiʹshon washed them awaythe ancient torrent the torrent of kiʹshon
you trampled down the powerful o my soul
22  then the hooves of horses poundedas his stallions galloped furiously
23  curse meʹroz said the angel of jehovahyes curse its inhabitantsfor they did not come to the assistance of jehovahto the assistance of jehovah with the mighty ones
24  most blessed of women is jaʹelthe wife of heʹber the kenʹiteshe is most blessed of women living in tents
25  he asked for water she gave him milk
in a majestic banquet bowl she offered curdled milk
26  with her hand she reached for the tent pinher right hand for the workmans mallet
and she hammered sisʹera she crushed his headand she smashed and pierced his temples
27  between her feet he collapsed he fell and lay stillbetween her feet he collapsed and fellwhere he collapsed there he fell defeated
28  from the window a woman looked outsisʹeras mother peered out from the latticewhy is his chariot delayed in coming why are the hoofbeats of his chariots so late
29  the wisest of her noble ladies would answer heryes she too would repeat to herself
30  they must be dividing the spoil they founda girl two girls to every warriorspoil of dyed cloth for sisʹera spoil of dyed clothan embroidered garment dyed cloth two embroidered garmentsfor the necks of the plunderers
31  so let all your enemies perish o jehovahbut let those who love you be like the sun rising in its glory
and the land had rest for 40 years
15  after a while in the days of the wheat harvest samson went to visit his wife bringing a young goat
he said i wish to go in to my wife in the bedroom
but her father did not allow him to go in
2  her father said i thought you must surely hate her
so i gave her to your groomsman
is not her younger sister more attractive than she is please take her instead
3  however samson said to them this time i cannot be blamed by the philisʹtines for harming them
4  so samson went and caught 300 foxes
then he took torches turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch between each pair of tails
5  then he set fire to the torches and sent the foxes out into the fields of standing grain of the philisʹtines
he set on fire everything from sheaf to standing grain as well as the vineyards and the olive groves
6  the philisʹtines asked who did this they were told it was samson the soninlaw of the timʹnite because he took his wife and gave her to his groomsman
at that the philisʹtines went up and burned her and her father with fire
7  then samson said to them if this is how you act i will not quit until i take revenge on you
8  then he struck them down one after the other with a great slaughter after which he went down and stayed in a cave of the crag eʹtam
9  later the philisʹtines came up and camped in judah and were tramping about in leʹhi
10  then the men of judah said why have you come up against us to which they answered we have come up to capture samson to do to him just as he did to us
11  so 3000 men of judah went down to the cave of the crag eʹtam and said to samson do you not know that the philisʹtines are ruling over us so why have you done this to us he said to them as they did to me so i did to them
12  but they said to him we have come to capture you and to hand you over to the philisʹtines
then samson said swear to me that you yourselves will not assault me
13  they said to him no we will only tie you and hand you over to them but we will not put you to death
so they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the crag
14  when he came to leʹhi the philisʹtines shouted triumphantly at meeting him
then jehovahs spirit empowered him and the ropes on his arms became like linen threads that were scorched with fire and his fetters melted off his hands
15  he now found a fresh jawbone of a male donkey he reached out and grabbed it and struck down 1000 men with it
16  then samson said with the jawbone of a donkeyone heap two heaps with the jawbone of a donkey i struck down 1000 men
17  when he finished speaking he threw the jawbone away and called that place raʹmathleʹhi
18  then he became very thirsty and he called on jehovah and said it was you who gave this great salvation into the hand of your servant
but now am i to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised
19  so god split open a hollow that was in leʹhi and water flowed from it
when he drank his spirit returned and he revived
that is why he named the place enhakkorʹe which is in leʹhi to this day
20  and he judged israel in the days of the philisʹtines for 20 years
20  consequently all the israelites came out from dan down to beʹersheʹba and from the land of gilʹead and the entire assembly gathered unitedly before jehovah at mizʹpah
2  so the chiefs of the people and all the tribes of israel took their places in the congregation of gods people400000 foot soldiers armed with swords
3  the benʹjaminites heard that the men of israel had gone up to mizʹpah
then the men of israel said tell us how did this terrible thing happen
4  at this the levite man the husband of the murdered woman said in answer i came to gibʹeah of benjamin with my concubine to stay overnight
5  and the inhabitants of gibʹeah rose up against me and surrounded the house by night
they meant to kill me but they raped my concubine instead and she died
6  so i took my concubines body and cut it up and sent the pieces into every part of israels inheritance because they had committed a shameful and disgraceful act in israel
7  now all you people of israel give your advice and counsel here
8  then all the people rose up in unison and said not one of us will go to his tent or return to his house
9  now this is what we will do to gibʹeah we will go up against it by lot
10  we will take 10 men out of 100 from all the tribes of israel and 100 out of 1000 and 1000 out of 10000 to collect provisions for the army so that they may take action against gibʹeah of benjamin in view of the disgraceful act that they committed in israel
11  thus all the men of israel were gathered against the city united as allies
12  then the tribes of israel sent men to all the tribesmen of benjamin saying what is this terrible thing that has happened among you
13  now hand over the worthless men from gibʹeah so that we may put them to death and clear out what is bad from israel
but the benʹjaminites refused to listen to their israelite brothers
14  then the benʹjaminites gathered together out of the cities to gibʹeah to go out to battle against the men of israel
15  that day the benʹjaminites mustered from their cities 26000 men armed with swords apart from the 700 chosen men of gibʹeah
16  in this army were 700 chosen men who were lefthanded
every one of these men could sling a stone to within a hairbreadth and would not miss
17  the men of israel apart from benjamin mustered 400000 men armed with swords and each one was an experienced warrior
18  they rose up and went up to bethʹel to inquire of god
then the people of israel said who of us should go up in the lead to the battle against the benʹjaminites jehovah replied judah is to take the lead
19  after that the israelites rose up in the morning and camped against gibʹeah
20  the men of israel now went out to battle against benjamin they drew up in battle formation against them at gibʹeah
21  so the benʹjaminites came out from gibʹeah and struck down 22000 men of israel on that day
22  however the army of the men of israel showed themselves courageous and again drew up in battle formation in the same place as on the first day
23  then the israelites went up and wept before jehovah until the evening and inquired of jehovah should we again go into battle against our brothers the people of benjamin to this jehovah said go up against them
24  so the israelites drew near to the benʹjaminites on the second day
25  in turn benjamin came out from gibʹeah to meet them on the second day and struck down another 18000 israelites all of them armed with swords
26  at that all the men of israel went up to bethʹel
they wept and sat there before jehovah and they fasted on that day until the evening and offered up burnt offerings and communion offerings before jehovah
27  after that the men of israel inquired of jehovah for the ark of the covenant of the true god was there in those days
28  now phinʹehas the son of eleaʹzar the son of aaron was ministering before it in those days
they asked should we go out yet again to battle against our brothers the men of benjamin or should we stop jehovah replied go up because tomorrow i will give them into your hand
29  then israel set men in ambush all around gibʹeah
30  the israelites went up against the benʹjaminites on the third day and they drew up in formation against gibʹeah the same as at the other times
31  when the benʹjaminites went out to meet the army they were drawn away from the city
then as at the other times they started to attack and kill some of the men on the highways one of which goes up to bethʹel and the other to gibʹeah leaving about 30 men of israel dead in the open field
32  so the benʹjaminites said they are suffering defeat before us the same as before
but the israelites said we will retreat and draw them away from the city onto the highways
33  so all the men of israel rose up from their places and drew up in formation at baʹaltaʹmar while the israelite ambush charged out of their places in the vicinity of gibʹeah
34  thus 10000 chosen men out of all israel came in front of gibʹeah and the fighting was heavy
but the benʹjaminites did not know that disaster was near at hand
35  jehovah defeated benjamin before israel and on that day the israelites struck down 25100 men in benjamin all of them armed with swords
36  however the benʹjaminites imagined that the men of israel would be defeated when they retreated from benjamin but they retreated because they trusted in the ambush that was set against gibʹeah
37  the ambush acted quickly and charged toward gibʹeah
then the ambush spread out and struck down the whole city with the sword
38  now the men of israel had arranged that the men who ambushed the city would make a smoke signal go up from there
39  when the israelites turned around in the battle the men of benjamin started by attacking and killing about 30 men of israel and they said they are clearly suffering another defeat before us just as in the previous battle
40  but the signal started to go up from the city as a pillar of smoke
when the men of benjamin turned to look they saw the whole city going up in flames to the sky
41  then the men of israel made an aboutface and the men of benjamin were dismayed for they saw that disaster had overtaken them
42  so they retreated from the men of israel toward the wilderness but the battle followed them the men coming out of the cities joined in striking them down
43  they surrounded the benʹjaminites and pursued them relentlessly
they trampled them down directly in front of gibʹeah toward the east
44  finally 18000 men of benjamin fell all mighty warriors
45  the men of benjamin turned and fled into the wilderness to the crag of rimʹmon and the israelites killed 5000 of them on the highways and they kept pursuing them as far as giʹdom so they struck down 2000 more men
46  all those of benjamin who fell on that day amounted to 25000 men armed with swords all mighty warriors
47  but 600 retreated into the wilderness to the crag of rimʹmon and they stayed on the crag of rimʹmon for four months
48  and the men of israel turned back against the benʹjaminites and struck those of the city with the sword from men to livestock all that remained
also they set all the cities in their path on fire
1  after the death of joshua the israelites inquired of jehovah who of us will go up first to fight against the caʹnaanites
2  jehovah replied judah will go up
look i am giving the land into his hand
3  then judah said to his brother simʹeon come up with me into my assigned territory to fight against the caʹnaanites
then i will go with you into your assigned territory
so simʹeon went with him
4  when judah went up jehovah gave the caʹnaanites and the perʹizzites into their hands and they defeated 10000 men in beʹzek
5  they found adoʹnibeʹzek in beʹzek and there they fought against him and defeated the caʹnaanites and the perʹizzites
6  when adoʹnibeʹzek fled they chased him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes
7  then adoʹnibeʹzek said there are 70 kings whose thumbs and big toes were cut off and who are picking up food under my table
just as i have done so god has repaid me
after that they brought him to jerusalem and he died there
8  furthermore the men of judah fought against jerusalem and captured it they struck it with the sword and set the city on fire
9  afterward the men of judah went down to fight against the caʹnaanites inhabiting the mountainous region and the negʹeb and the shepheʹlah
10  so judah marched against the caʹnaanites who were dwelling in hebʹron the name of hebʹron was previously kirʹiatharʹba and they struck down sheʹshai ahiʹman and talʹmai
11  they marched from there against the inhabitants of deʹbir
the name of deʹbir was previously kirʹiathseʹpher
12  then caʹleb said to the man who strikes kirʹiathseʹpher and captures it i will give my daughter achʹsah as a wife
13  and othʹniel the son of keʹnaz caʹlebs younger brother captured it
so he gave him his daughter achʹsah as a wife
14  while she was going home she urged him to ask her father for a field
then she dismounted from her donkey
caʹleb asked her what do you want
15  she said to him please grant me a blessing for you have given me a piece of land in the south give me also gulʹlothmaʹim
so caʹleb gave her upper gulʹloth and lower gulʹloth
16  and the descendants of the kenʹite moses fatherinlaw came up from the city of palm trees with the people of judah to the wilderness of judah south of aʹrad
they went there and settled among the people
17  but judah marched on with his brother simʹeon and they attacked the caʹnaanites inhabiting zeʹphath and devoted it to destruction
so they named the city horʹmah
18  then judah captured gazʹa and its territory ashʹkelon and its territory and ekʹron and its territory
19  jehovah was with judah and they took possession of the mountainous region but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had war chariots with iron scythes
20  they gave hebʹron to caʹleb just as moses had promised and he drove out from there the three sons of aʹnak
21  but the benʹjaminites did not drive out the jebʹusites inhabiting jerusalem so the jebʹusites continue dwelling with the benʹjaminites in jerusalem down to this day
22  meantime the house of joseph went up against bethʹel and jehovah was with them
23  the house of joseph was spying on bethʹel incidentally the name of the city was previously luz
24  and the spies saw a man going out of the city
so they said to him show us please the way into the city and we will treat you kindly
25  so the man showed them the way into the city and they struck the city with the sword but they let the man and all his family go free
26  the man went to the land of the hitʹtites and built a city and named it luz which is its name to this day
27  manasʹseh did not take possession of bethsheʹan and its dependent towns taʹanach and its dependent towns the inhabitants of dor and its dependent towns the inhabitants of ibʹleam and its dependent towns and the inhabitants of megidʹdo and its dependent towns
the caʹnaanites persisted in dwelling in this land
28  when israel grew stronger they subjected the caʹnaanites to forced labor but they did not drive them out completely
29  nor did eʹphraim drive out the caʹnaanites who were dwelling in geʹzer
the caʹnaanites continued to dwell among them in geʹzer
30  zebʹulun did not drive out the inhabitants of kitʹron and the inhabitants of naʹhalol
the caʹnaanites continued to dwell among them and were subjected to forced labor
31  ashʹer did not drive out the inhabitants of acʹco and the inhabitants of siʹdon ahʹlab achʹzib helʹbah aʹphik and reʹhob
32  so the ashʹerites continued to dwell among the caʹnaanites inhabiting the land because they did not drive them out
33  naphʹtali did not drive out the inhabitants of bethsheʹmesh and the inhabitants of bethaʹnath but they continued to dwell among the caʹnaanites inhabiting the land
the inhabitants of bethsheʹmesh and bethaʹnath became forced laborers for them
34  the amʹorites confined the danʹites to the mountainous region for they would not let them come down into the plain
35  so the amʹorites persisted in dwelling in mount heʹres aiʹjalon and shaalʹbim
but when the power of the house of joseph increased they were forced into hard labor
36  the territory of the amʹorites was from the ascent of akrabʹbim from seʹla upward
2  then jehovahs angel went up from gilʹgal to boʹchim and said i brought you up out of egypt into the land about which i swore to your forefathers
furthermore i said i will never break my covenant with you
2  for your part you must not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land and you should pull down their altars
but you have not obeyed my voice
why have you done this
3  that is why i also said i will not drive them away from before you and they will ensnare you and their gods will lure you away
4  when jehovahs angel spoke these words to all the israelites the people began to weep loudly
5  so they named that place boʹchim and they sacrificed there to jehovah
6  when joshua sent the people away each of the israelites went to his inheritance to take possession of the land
7  the people continued to serve jehovah all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived joshua and who had seen all of jehovahs great deeds in behalf of israel
8  then joshua the son of nun the servant of jehovah died at the age of 110
9  so they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in timʹnathheʹres in the mountainous region of eʹphraim north of mount gaʹash
10  all that generation were gathered to their ancestors and another generation arose after them that did not know jehovah or what he had done for israel
11  so the israelites did what was bad in the eyes of jehovah and served the baʹals
12  thus they abandoned jehovah the god of their fathers who brought them out of the land of egypt
and they followed other gods the gods of the peoples who were all around them and they bowed down to them and offended jehovah
13  they abandoned jehovah and served baʹal and the ashʹtoreth images
14  at this jehovahs anger blazed against israel so he handed them over to plunderers who pillaged them
he sold them into the hand of the enemies around them and they were no longer able to hold their own against their enemies
15  wherever they went the hand of jehovah was against them bringing disaster on them just as jehovah had said and just as jehovah had sworn to them and they were in great distress
16  so jehovah would raise up judges who would save them from the hand of their plunderers
17  but they refused to listen even to the judges and would prostitute themselves to other gods and bow down to them
they quickly turned aside from the way in which their forefathers had walked those who had obeyed the commandments of jehovah
they failed to do that
18  whenever jehovah did raise up judges for them jehovah would be with the judge and save them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for jehovah was moved to pity over their groaning caused by those who oppressed them and those who were treating them abusively
19  but when the judge died they would again act more corruptly than their fathers by following other gods serving them and bowing down to them
they did not abandon their practices and their stubborn behavior
20  finally jehovahs anger blazed against israel and he said because this nation has violated my covenant that i commanded their forefathers and they have disobeyed me
21  i for my part will not drive out from before them even one of the nations that joshua left behind when he died
22  this is to test whether israel will keep jehovahs way by walking in it as their fathers did
23  so jehovah allowed these nations to remain
he did not drive them out quickly and he did not give them into joshuas hand
3  these are the nations that jehovah allowed to remain so that they could test all those of israel who had not experienced any of the wars of caʹnaan
2  this was so that succeeding generations of israelites would experience war those who had not experienced such things before
3  the five lords of the philisʹtines and all the caʹnaanites the sidoʹnians and the hiʹvites inhabiting mount lebʹanon from mount baʹalherʹmon as far as leʹbohaʹmath
4  they served as a means of testing israel to determine whether israel would obey jehovahs commandments that he had given their fathers through moses
5  so the israelites lived among the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the amʹorites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites
6  they would take their daughters as wives and their own daughters they gave to their sons and they began serving their gods
7  so the israelites did what was bad in jehovahs eyes and they forgot jehovah their god and were serving the baʹals and the sacred poles
8  at this jehovahs anger blazed against israel and he sold them into the hand of cuʹshanrishathaʹim the king of mesopotaʹmia
the israelites served cuʹshanrishathaʹim for eight years
9  when the israelites called to jehovah for help jehovah raised up a savior to rescue the israelites othʹniel the son of keʹnaz the younger brother of caʹleb
10  the spirit of jehovah came upon him and he became the judge of israel
when he went out to battle jehovah gave cuʹshanrishathaʹim the king of mesopotaʹmia into his hand so that he prevailed over cuʹshanrishathaʹim
11  after that the land had rest for 40 years
then othʹniel the son of keʹnaz died
12  and once again the israelites began doing what was bad in jehovahs eyes
so jehovah let egʹlon the king of moʹab prevail over israel because they did what was bad in jehovahs eyes
13  furthermore he brought against them the amʹmonites and the amalʹekites
they attacked israel and captured the city of palm trees
14  the israelites served egʹlon the king of moʹab for 18 years
15  then the israelites called to jehovah for help so jehovah raised up for them a savior eʹhud the son of geʹra a benʹjaminite who was lefthanded
in time the israelites sent tribute through him to egʹlon the king of moʹab
16  meanwhile eʹhud made for himself a twoedged sword a cubit long and he strapped it underneath his garment on his right thigh
17  he then presented the tribute to egʹlon the king of moʹab
now egʹlon was a very fat man
18  when eʹhud finished presenting the tribute he sent away the people who had carried the tribute
19  but after reaching the carved images at gilʹgal he himself went back and said i have a secret message for you o king
so the king said silence with that all his attendants left him
20  so eʹhud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber
then eʹhud said i have a message from god for you
so he rose up from his throne
21  then eʹhud drew the sword from his right thigh with his left hand and plunged it into his belly
22  the handle went in after the blade and the fat closed in over the blade for he did not draw the sword out of his belly and the fecal matter came out
23  eʹhud went out through the porch closing the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locking them
24  after he left the servants returned and saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked
so they said he must be relieving himself in the cool interior room
25  they kept waiting until they were embarrassed but when they saw that he was still not opening the doors of the roof chamber they took the key and opened them and saw their lord fallen to the floor dead
26  eʹhud escaped while they were lingering and he passed by the carved images and made it safely to seiʹrah
27  when he arrived he sounded the horn in the mountainous region of eʹphraim and the israelites went down out of the mountainous region with him at their head
28  then he said to them follow me because jehovah has given your enemies the moʹabites into your hand
so they followed him and captured the fords of the jordan against the moʹabites and they did not allow anyone to cross
29  at that time they struck down about 10000 moʹabites all strong and valiant men not a single one escaped
30  so moʹab was subdued on that day under israels hand and the land had rest for 80 years
31  after him was shamʹgar the son of aʹnath who struck down 600 philisʹtine men with a cattle goad he too saved israel
12  then the men of eʹphraim were summoned and they crossed over to zaʹphon and said to jephʹthah why did you not call us to go with you when you crossed over to fight against the amʹmonites we will burn your house down with you in it
2  but jephʹthah said to them along with my people i was engaged in a great conflict with the amʹmonites
i did call to you for help but you did not save me from their hand
3  when i saw that you would not save me then i decided to risk my life and go against the amʹmonites and jehovah handed them over to me
so why have you come today to fight against me
4  jephʹthah then gathered all the men of gilʹead and they fought eʹphraim the men of gilʹead defeated eʹphraim who had said you are only fugitives from eʹphraim you gilʹeadites in eʹphraim and manasʹseh
5  gilʹead captured the fords of the jordan ahead of eʹphraim and when the men of eʹphraim were trying to escape they would say let me cross over then the men of gilʹead would ask each one are you an eʹphraimite when he would reply no
6  they would say to him please say shibʹboleth
but he would say sibʹboleth as he was unable to say the word correctly
then they would seize him and slay him at the fords of the jordan
so 42000 eʹphraimites fell at that time
7  jephʹthah judged israel for six years after which jephʹthah the gilʹeadite died and was buried in his city in gilʹead
8  ibʹzan from bethʹlehem judged israel after him
9  he had 30 sons and 30 daughters
he sent his daughters to marry men outside his clan and he brought in 30 women to marry his sons
he judged israel for seven years
10  then ibʹzan died and was buried in bethʹlehem
11  after him eʹlon the zebuʹlunite judged israel he judged israel for ten years
12  then eʹlon the zebuʹlunite died and was buried in aiʹjalon in the land of zebʹulun
13  after him abʹdon the son of hilʹlel the pirʹathonite judged israel
14  he had 40 sons and 30 grandsons who rode on 70 donkeys
he judged israel for eight years
15  then abʹdon the son of hilʹlel the pirʹathonite died and was buried in pirʹathon in the land of eʹphraim in the mountain of the amalʹekite
