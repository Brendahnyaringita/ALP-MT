10  samuel then took the flask of oil and poured it out on sauls head
he kissed him and said has not jehovah anointed you as a leader over his inheritance
2  when you leave me today you will find two men near the tomb of rachel in the territory of benjamin at zelʹzah and they will say to you the donkeys that you went to look for have been found but now your father has forgotten about the donkeys and is worried about you
he is saying what should i do about my son
3  go on from there until you come to the big tree of taʹbor where you will meet three men going up to the true god at bethʹel one carrying three young goats one carrying three loaves of bread and one carrying a large jar of wine
4  they will ask about your welfare and give you two loaves and you must accept the loaves from them
5  after that you will come to the hill of the true god where there is a garrison of the philisʹtines
when you come to the city you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place and a stringed instrument and tambourine and flute and harp will be played ahead of them while they are prophesying
6  the spirit of jehovah will empower you and you will prophesy along with them and be changed into a different person
7  when these signs have taken place do whatever your hand finds possible because the true god is with you
8  then go down ahead of me to gilʹgal and i will go down to you there to offer up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices
you should wait for seven days until i come to you
then i will let you know what you should do
9  as soon as saul turned around to leave samuel god began changing his heart to be like that of someone else and all these signs came true on that day
10  so they went from there to the hill and a group of prophets met him
at once the spirit of god empowered him and he began to prophesy among them
11  when all those who previously knew him saw him prophesying with the prophets they said to one another what has happened to the son of kish is saul also among the prophets
12  then a man from there said but who is their father so it became a saying is saul also among the prophets
13  when he finished prophesying he came to the high place
14  the brother of sauls father later said to him and to his attendant where did you go at that he said to look for the donkeys but we saw that they were not there so we went to samuel
15  sauls uncle asked please tell me what did samuel say to you
16  saul replied to his uncle he told us that the donkeys had already been found
but saul did not tell him what samuel said about the matter of the kingship
17  samuel then called the people together to jehovah at mizʹpah
18  and said to the israelites this is what jehovah the god of israel says it was i who brought israel up out of egypt and who rescued you from the hand of egypt and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you
19  but today you have rejected your god who was your savior out of all your evils and distresses and you said no you should appoint a king over us
now take your stand before jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands
20  so samuel had all the tribes of israel draw near and the tribe of benjamin was selected
21  then he had the tribe of benjamin draw near by its families and the family of the matʹrites was selected
finally saul the son of kish was selected
but when they went to look for him he was nowhere to be found
22  so they inquired of jehovah has the man come here yet jehovah answered there he is hiding himself among the luggage
23  so they ran and brought him from there
when he stood in the middle of the people he was head and shoulders taller than all the other people
24  samuel said to all the people do you see the one whom jehovah has chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people began to shout long live the king
25  samuel spoke to the people about the rightful due of kings and wrote it in a book and deposited it before jehovah
then samuel sent all the people away everyone to his house
26  saul also went to his home in gibʹeah accompanied by the warriors whose hearts jehovah had touched
27  but some worthless men said how will this one save us so they despised him and they did not bring any gift to him
but he said nothing about it
4  and the word of samuel went out to all israel
then israel went out to meet the philisʹtines in battle they camped beside ebeneʹzer and the philisʹtines were encamped at aʹphek
2  the philisʹtines drew up in battle formation to meet israel but the battle went badly and israel was defeated by the philisʹtines who struck down about 4000 men from the battle line in the field
3  when the people returned to the camp the elders of israel said why did jehovah allow us to be defeated today by the philisʹtines let us take the ark of jehovahs covenant with us from shiʹloh so that it may be with us and save us from the hand of our enemies
4  so the people sent men to shiʹloh and they carried from there the ark of the covenant of jehovah of armies who sits enthroned above the cherubs
the two sons of eʹli hophʹni and phinʹehas were also there with the ark of the covenant of the true god
5  as soon as the ark of the covenant of jehovah came into the camp all the israelites broke out into loud shouting so that the earth shook
6  when the philisʹtines heard the sound of the shouting they said why is there such loud shouting in the camp of the hebrews finally they learned that the ark of jehovah had come into the camp
7  the philisʹtines became afraid for they said god has come into the camp so they said too bad for us for nothing like this has ever happened before
8  too bad for us who will save us from the hand of this majestic god this is the god who struck egypt with every sort of slaughter in the wilderness
9  be courageous and act like men you philisʹtines so that you may not serve the hebrews just as they have served you
act like men and fight
10  so the philisʹtines fought and israel was defeated and each one fled to his tent
the slaughter was very great on israels side 30000 foot soldiers fell
11  moreover the ark of god was captured and the two sons of eʹli hophʹni and phinʹehas died
12  a man of benjamin ran from the battle line and arrived at shiʹloh on that day with his garments ripped apart and dirt on his head
13  when the man arrived eʹli was sitting on the seat by the roadside watching because his heart was trembling over the ark of the true god
the man went into the city to report the news and the whole city began crying out
14  when eʹli heard the sound of the outcry he asked what does the sound of this turmoil mean the same man hurried in and reported the news to eʹli
15  now eʹli was 98 years old and his eyes stared straight ahead and he could not see
16  then the man said to eʹli i am the one who came from the battle line just today i fled from the battle line
at this he asked what happened my son
17  so the bearer of the news related israel has fled from the philisʹtines and there was a great defeat among the people also your own two sons hophʹni and phinʹehas have died and the ark of the true god has been captured
18  at the moment he mentioned the ark of the true god eʹli fell backward from his seat beside the gate and his neck was broken and he died for he was old and heavy
he had judged israel for 40 years
19  his daughterinlaw the wife of phinʹehas was pregnant and close to giving birth
when she heard the report that the ark of the true god had been captured and that her fatherinlaw and her husband had died she doubled over and unexpectedly went into labor and gave birth
20  as she was dying the women standing by her said do not be afraid for you have given birth to a son
she did not answer and did not pay attention to it
21  but she named the boy ichʹabod saying glory has gone away from israel into exile referring to the capture of the ark of the true god and what happened to her fatherinlaw and her husband
22  she said glory has gone away from israel into exile because the ark of the true god has been captured
26  in time the men of ziph came to saul at gibʹeah saying is david not hiding on the hill of hachiʹlah facing jeshiʹmon
2  so saul rose up and went down to the wilderness of ziph with 3000 chosen men of israel to look for david in the wilderness of ziph
3  saul camped on the hill of hachiʹlah which faces jeshiʹmon by the road
david was then living in the wilderness and he learned that saul had come into the wilderness after him
4  so david sent spies to verify that saul had indeed come
5  david later went to the place where saul had encamped and david saw the place where saul and abʹner the son of ner the chief of his army were lying asleep saul lay asleep in the camp enclosure with the troops camping all around him
6  then david said to ahimʹelech the hitʹtite and abishʹai the son of zeruʹiah the brother of joʹab who will go down with me into the camp to saul abishʹai replied i will go down with you
7  so david and abishʹai made their way to the troops by night and they found saul lying asleep in the camp enclosure with his spear stuck into the ground next to his head abʹner and the troops were lying all around him
8  abishʹai now said to david today god has surrendered your enemy into your hand
and now please let me pin him to the ground with the spear just once and i will not need to do it twice
9  however david said to abishʹai do not harm him for who can lift his hand against the anointed of jehovah and remain innocent
10  david continued as surely as jehovah is living jehovah himself will strike him down or his day will come and he will die or he will go down into battle and perish
11  it is unthinkable from jehovahs standpoint for me to lift my hand against the anointed of jehovah so now take please the spear next to his head and the water jug and let us be on our way
12  so david took the spear and the water jug from next to sauls head and they went away
no one saw or noticed them or woke up for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from jehovah had fallen upon them
13  then david crossed to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain some distance away with a considerable space between them
14  david called out to the troops and to abʹner the son of ner saying abʹner will you not answer abʹner answered who are you who calls to the king
15  david said to abʹner are you not a man and who is like you in israel so why did you not keep watch over your lord the king for one of the soldiers came in to do away with your lord the king
16  what you have done is not good
as surely as jehovah is living you deserve to die because you have not kept watch over your lord the anointed of jehovah
now look around where are the kings spear and the water jug that were next to his head
17  then saul recognized the voice of david and said is this your voice my son david david replied it is my voice my lord the king
18  he added why is my lord chasing after his servant for what have i done and what am i guilty of
19  my lord the king please listen to the words of his servant if it is jehovah who incited you against me let him accept my grain offering
but if men have incited you they are cursed before jehovah because they have driven me away today from being united with jehovahs inheritance saying go serve other gods
20  and now do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of jehovah for the king of israel has gone out to look for a single flea as if he were chasing a partridge on the mountains
21  in turn saul said i have sinned
come back my son david for i will do you no more harm because you regarded my life as precious this day
yes i have acted foolishly and have made a terrible mistake
22  david answered here is the spear of the king
let one of the young men come over and take it
23  it is jehovah who will repay each one for his own righteousness and his own faithfulness for today jehovah gave you into my hand but i was unwilling to lift my hand against the anointed of jehovah
24  look just as your life was precious to me this day so may my life be precious in the eyes of jehovah and may he rescue me out of all distress
25  saul replied to david may you be blessed my son david
you will surely do great things and you will surely prevail
then david went on his way and saul returned to his place
11  then naʹhash the amʹmonite came up and camped against jaʹbesh in gilʹead
all the men of jaʹbesh said to naʹhash make a covenant with us and we will serve you
2  naʹhash the amʹmonite said to them i will make it with you on this condition that all your right eyes be bored out
i will do this to humiliate all israel
3  the elders of jaʹbesh replied to him give us seven days time so that we can send messengers into all the territory of israel
then if there is no one to rescue us we will surrender to you
4  in time the messengers came to gibʹeah of saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people and all the people wept at the top of their voice
5  but saul was coming from the field behind the herd and saul said what is the matter with the people why are they weeping so they related to him the words of the men of jaʹbesh
6  the spirit of god empowered saul when he heard these words and he burned with anger
7  so he took a pair of bulls and cut them into pieces and he sent these into all the territory of israel by the hand of the messengers who said whoever does not follow saul and samuel should expect this to be done to his cattle and the fear of jehovah fell upon the people so that they came out with one accord
8  then he counted them in beʹzek and there were 300000 israelites and 30000 men of judah
9  they now said to the messengers who had come this is what you should say to the men of jaʹbesh in gilʹead tomorrow when the sun gets hot you will be saved
with that the messengers came and told the men of jaʹbesh and they were overjoyed
10  so the men of jaʹbesh said tomorrow we will surrender to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you
11  on the next day saul divided the people into three bands and they made their way into the middle of the camp during the morning watch and struck down the amʹmonites until the day grew hot
those who survived were scattered so that no two of them were left together
12  then the people said to samuel who was saying is saul to be king over us hand the men over and we will put them to death
13  however saul said not a man should be put to death on this day for today jehovah has rescued israel
14  samuel later said to the people come and let us go to gilʹgal to reconfirm the kingship
15  so all the people went to gilʹgal and in gilʹgal they made saul king before jehovah
then they offered communion sacrifices there before jehovah and saul and all the men of israel celebrated with great joy
8  when samuel had grown old he appointed his sons as judges for israel
2  the name of his firstborn son was joel and the name of his second abiʹjah they were judges in beʹersheʹba
3  but his sons did not walk in his ways they were inclined to pursue dishonest profit they accepted bribes and they perverted justice
4  in time all the elders of israel gathered together and came to samuel at raʹmah
5  they said to him look you have grown old but your sons are not walking in your ways
now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the other nations
6  but it displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us
then samuel prayed to jehovah
7  and jehovah said to samuel listen to everything the people say to you for it is not you whom they have rejected but it is i whom they have rejected as their king
8  they are doing just as they have done from the day i brought them up out of egypt until this day they keep forsaking me and serving other gods and that is what they are doing to you
9  now listen to them
however you should solemnly warn them tell them what the king who rules over them will have the right to demand
10  so samuel told the people who were asking him for a king all the words of jehovah
11  he said this is what the king who rules over you will have the right to demand he will take your sons and put them in his chariots and make them his horsemen and some will have to run before his chariots
12  and he will appoint for himself chiefs over thousands and chiefs over fifties and some will do his plowing reap his harvest and make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots
13  he will take your daughters to be ointment mixers cooks and bakers
14  he will take the best of your fields your vineyards and your olive groves and he will give them to his servants
15  he will take the tenth of your grainfields and your vineyards and he will give it to his court officials and his servants
16  and he will take your male and female servants your best herds and your donkeys and he will use them for his work
17  he will take the tenth of your flocks and you will become his servants
18  the day will come when you will cry out because of the king you have chosen for yourselves but jehovah will not answer you in that day
19  however the people refused to listen to what samuel told them and they said no we are determined to have a king over us
20  then we will be like all the other nations and our king will judge us and lead us and fight our battles
21  after samuel heard all the words of the people he repeated them in the hearing of jehovah
22  jehovah said to samuel listen to them and appoint a king to reign over them
samuel then said to the men of israel each of you should return to his city
30  when david and his men came to zikʹlag on the third day the amalʹekites had made a raid on the south and on zikʹlag and they had attacked zikʹlag and burned it with fire
2  they had taken captive the women and all who were in it from the smallest to the greatest
they had not killed anyone but they had carried them off and gone on their way
3  when david and his men came to the city they found it burned down and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been carried off captive
4  so david and the men with him began weeping loudly until they had no strength left to weep
5  davids two wives had also been carried off captive ahinʹoam of jezʹreel and abʹigail the widow of naʹbal the carʹmelite
6  david was very distressed because the men were talking of stoning him for all the men had become very bitter over the loss of their sons and daughters
but david strengthened himself by jehovah his god
7  david then said to abiʹathar the priest the son of ahimʹelech please bring the ephʹod here
so abiʹathar brought the ephʹod to david
8  david inquired of jehovah should i chase after this marauder band will i overtake them at this he said to him go in pursuit for you will certainly overtake them and you will make the rescue
9  david immediately set out with the 600 men who were with him and they went on as far as the wadi beʹsor where some of the men stayed behind
10  david kept up the chase with 400 men but the 200 men who were too tired to cross the wadi beʹsor stayed behind
11  they found an egyptian man in the field and took him to david
they gave him food to eat and water to drink
12  as well as a slice of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins
after he ate he regained his strength for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights
13  david now asked him to whom do you belong and where are you from to which he said i am an egyptian attendant a slave of an amalʹekite man but my master left me because i got sick three days ago
14  we made a raid on the south of the cherʹethites and on the territory of judah and on the south of caʹleb and zikʹlag we burned with fire
15  at this david said to him will you lead me down to this marauder band he replied if you swear to me by god that you will not put me to death and that you will not hand me over to my master i will lead you down to this marauder band
16  so he led him down to where they were spread out all over the land eating and drinking and celebrating because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the philisʹtines and the land of judah
17  then david struck them down from the morning darkness until the following evening not a man escaped except 400 men who fled on camels
18  david recovered all that the amalʹekites had taken and david rescued his two wives
19  nothing of theirs was missing from the smallest to the greatest
they recovered their sons and daughters and the spoil david recovered everything that they had taken
20  so david took all the flocks and the herds which they drove before their own livestock
they said this is davids spoil
21  then david came to the 200 men who had been too tired to go along with david and who had stayed behind by the wadi beʹsor and they came out to meet david and the people with him
when david came near to the men he asked them how they were
22  however every bad and worthless man among those who had gone with david said since they did not go with us we will not give them any of the spoil that we recovered except that each one may take his wife and his sons and go away
23  but david said you must not do this my brothers with what jehovah has given us
he protected us and gave into our hand the marauder band that came against us
24  who would agree with you on this the share of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the share of the one who sat by the baggage
all will have a share together
25  and from that day forward he kept it set as a regulation and a rule for israel down to this day
26  when david returned to zikʹlag he sent some of the spoil to the elders of judah who were his friends saying here is a gift for you from the spoil of jehovahs enemies
27  he sent it to those who were in bethʹel to those in raʹmoth of the negʹeb to those in jatʹtir
28  to those in aroʹer to those in siphʹmoth to those in eshtemoʹa
29  to those in raʹcal to those in the cities of the jerahʹmeelites to those in the cities of the kenʹites
30  to those in horʹmah to those in borʹashan to those in aʹthach
31  to those in hebʹron and to all the places that david and his men had frequented
16  jehovah eventually said to samuel how long will you mourn for saul now that i have rejected him from ruling as king over israel fill your horn with oil and go
i will send you to jesʹse the bethʹlehemite because i have selected from among his sons a king for myself
2  but samuel said how can i go when saul hears about it he will kill me
jehovah replied take a young cow with you and say i have come to sacrifice to jehovah
3  invite jesʹse to the sacrifice then i will make known to you what to do
you must anoint for me the one whom i designate to you
4  samuel did what jehovah said
when he came to bethʹlehem the elders of the city were trembling at meeting him and they said does your coming mean peace
5  to this he said it means peace
i have come to sacrifice to jehovah
sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice
then he sanctified jesʹse and his sons after which he summoned them to the sacrifice
6  as they came in and he saw eliʹab he said surely here before jehovah stands his anointed one
7  but jehovah said to samuel do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is for i have rejected him
for the way man sees is not the way god sees because mere man sees what appears to the eyes but jehovah sees into the heart
8  then jesʹse called abinʹadab and had him pass before samuel but he said jehovah has not chosen this one either
9  next jesʹse presented shamʹmah but he said jehovah has not chosen this one either
10  so jesʹse had seven of his sons pass before samuel but samuel said to jesʹse jehovah has not chosen any of these
11  finally samuel said to jesʹse are these all of your boys to this he said the youngest has been left out until now he is pasturing the sheep
then samuel said to jesʹse send for him because we will not sit down for the meal until he comes here
12  so he sent for him and brought him in
now he was ruddy with beautiful eyes and handsome in appearance
then jehovah said get up anoint him for this is the one
13  so samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers
and the spirit of jehovah began to empower david from that day forward
samuel later rose and went his way to raʹmah
14  now the spirit of jehovah had departed from saul and a bad spirit from jehovah terrorized him
15  the servants of saul said to him you see that a bad spirit from god is terrorizing you
16  let our lord please command your servants before you to look for a man who is skilled at playing the harp
whenever a bad spirit from god comes upon you he will play it and you will feel better
17  so saul said to his servants find me please a man who plays well and bring him to me
18  one of the attendants said look i have seen how a son of jesʹse the bethʹlehemite plays skillfully and he is a courageous mighty warrior
he can speak well and he is handsome and jehovah is with him
19  saul then sent messengers to jesʹse and said send to me your son david who is with the flock
20  so jesʹse loaded a donkey with bread a skin bottle of wine and a young goat and sent them to saul with his son david
21  thus david came to saul and began serving him
saul grew to love him very much and he became his armorbearer
22  saul sent a message to jesʹse please let david remain in my service for he has found favor in my eyes
23  whenever a bad spirit from god came upon saul david took the harp and played it and saul found relief and felt better and the bad spirit would depart from him
18  as soon as david had finished speaking to saul jonʹathan and david became bound together in close friendship and jonʹathan began to love him as himself
2  from that day saul kept david with him and he did not allow him to return to his fathers house
3  and jonʹathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as himself
4  jonʹathan took off the sleeveless coat that he wore and gave it to david along with his gear his sword his bow and his belt
5  david began going out and was successful wherever saul would send him
so saul put him in charge of the fighting men and this pleased all the people and the servants of saul
6  when david and the others would return from striking down the philisʹtines the women would come out from all the cities of israel with song and dances to meet king saul with tambourines with rejoicing and with lutes
7  the women who were celebrating would sing saul has struck down his thousandsand david his tens of thousands
8  saul became very angry and this song displeased him for he said they have credited david with tens of thousands but to me they have credited thousands
the only thing left to give him is the kingship
9  from that day on saul was always looking at david suspiciously
10  the next day a bad spirit from god gripped saul and he started to act strangely inside the house while david was playing music on the harp as on other occasions
saul had a spear in his hand
11  and he hurled the spear saying to himself i will pin david to the wall but david escaped from him twice
12  then saul was afraid of david because jehovah was with him but had departed from saul
13  so saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as chief of a thousand and david would lead the army into battle
14  david continued to have success in all he did and jehovah was with him
15  and when saul saw that he was very successful he became afraid of him
16  but all israel and judah loved david because he would lead them in their campaigns
17  saul later said to david here is my oldest daughter meʹrab
i will give her to you as a wife
however you should continue to display your courage for me and fight the wars of jehovah
for saul said to himself do not let my hand come against him
let the hand of the philisʹtines strike him
18  at this david said to saul who am i and who are my relatives my fathers family in israel for me to become soninlaw to the king
19  however when the time came to give sauls daughter meʹrab to david she had already been given to be the wife of aʹdriel the meholʹathite
20  now sauls daughter miʹchal was in love with david and it was reported to saul and this pleased him
21  so saul said i will give her to him to serve as a snare to him so that the hand of the philisʹtines may come upon him
saul then said to david a second time you will form a marriage alliance with me today
22  further saul ordered his servants speak to david secretly and say look the king is pleased with you and all his servants are fond of you
so now form a marriage alliance with the king
23  when sauls servants told david these things david said is it a trivial matter to you to form a marriage alliance with the king when i am a man poor and lightly esteemed
24  then sauls servants reported to him these are the words that david spoke
25  at that saul said this is what you should say to david the king does not want any bride price except 100 foreskins of the philisʹtines to take revenge on the enemies of the king
for saul was scheming to have david fall by the hand of the philisʹtines
26  so his servants reported these words to david and it was pleasing to david to form a marriage alliance with the king
before the allotted time
27  david went with his men and struck down 200 philisʹtine men and david brought the full number of their foreskins to the king to form a marriage alliance with the king
therefore saul gave him his daughter miʹchal as a wife
28  saul realized that jehovah was with david and that his daughter miʹchal loved him
29  this made saul even more afraid of david and saul became an enemy of david for the rest of his life
30  the princes of the philisʹtines would go out to battle but as often as they went out david was more successful than all the servants of saul and his name was highly esteemed
17  and the philisʹtines assembled their armies for war
they assembled at soʹcoh which belongs to judah and they camped between soʹcoh and azeʹkah in eʹphesdamʹmim
2  saul and the men of israel assembled and camped in the valley of eʹlah and they drew up in battle formation to meet the philisʹtines
3  the philisʹtines occupied the mountain on one side and the israelites occupied the mountain on the other side with the valley between them
4  then a champion came out from the camps of the philisʹtines his name was goliʹath from gath and his height was six cubits and a span
5  he had a helmet of copper on his head and he was wearing a coat of mail of overlapping scales
the weight of the copper coat of mail was 5000 shekels
6  he had shin guards of copper on his legs and a javelin of copper slung between his shoulders
7  the wooden shaft of his spear was like the beam of loom workers and the iron blade of his spear weighed 600 shekels and his shieldbearer was marching ahead of him
8  then he stood and called out to the battle line of israel and said to them why have you come out to draw up in battle formation am i not the philisʹtine and are you not the servants of saul choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me
9  if he is able to fight with me and strike me down we will then become your servants
but if i prevail against him and strike him down you will become our servants and serve us
10  the philisʹtine then said i do taunt the battle line of israel this day
give me a man and let us fight it out
11  when saul and all israel heard these words of the philisʹtine they became terrified and greatly afraid
12  now david was the son of the ephʹrathite from bethʹlehem of judah named jesʹse who had eight sons and who in the days of saul was already an old man
13  the three oldest sons of jesʹse had followed saul to the war
the names of his three sons who went to war were eliʹab the firstborn his second son abinʹadab and the third shamʹmah
14  david was the youngest and the three oldest followed saul
15  david was going back and forth from saul to tend the sheep of his father at bethʹlehem
16  meanwhile the philisʹtine would come forward and take his position each morning and each evening for 40 days
17  then jesʹse said to his son david take please this eʹphah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread and carry them quickly to your brothers in the camp
18  and take these ten portions of cheese to the chief of the thousand also you should check on the welfare of your brothers and bring back some token from them
19  they were with saul and all the other men of israel in the valley of eʹlah fighting against the philisʹtines
20  so david got up early in the morning and left someone in charge of the sheep then he packed up and went just as jesʹse had commanded him
when he came to the camp enclosure the army was going out to the battle line shouting a battle cry
21  israel and the philisʹtines drew up so that one battle line faced the other battle line
22  david immediately left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper and ran to the battle line
when he arrived he began asking about the welfare of his brothers
23  while he was speaking with them there came the champion named goliʹath the philisʹtine from gath
he came out from the battle line of the philisʹtines and he spoke the same words as before and david heard him
24  when all the men of israel saw the man they fled from him terrified
25  the men of israel were saying have you seen this man who is coming out he comes to taunt israel
the king will give great riches to the man who strikes him down he will give him his own daughter and he will give the house of his father exemption in israel
26  david began to say to the men who were standing near him what will be done for the man who strikes down that philisʹtine over there and takes away reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philisʹtine that he should taunt the battle line of the living god
27  then the people told him the same thing as before this is what will be done for the man who strikes him down
28  when his oldest brother eliʹab heard him speak to the men he became angry with david and said why have you come down and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness i well know your presumptuousness and the bad intentions of your heart you came down just to see the battle
29  to this david said what have i done now i was only asking a question
30  so he turned from him toward someone else and asked the same thing as before and the people gave him the same reply as before
31  the words that david had spoken were overheard and reported to saul
so he sent for him
32  david said to saul let no one lose heart because of him
your servant will go and fight with this philisʹtine
33  but saul said to david you are not able to go fight against this philisʹtine for you are but a boy and he has been a soldier from his youth
34  david then said to saul your servant became a shepherd of his fathers flock and a lion came also a bear and each carried off a sheep from the flock
35  i went out after it and struck it down and rescued it from its mouth
when it rose up against me i grabbed it by its fur and struck it down and put it to death
36  your servant struck down both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philisʹtine will become like one of them for he has taunted the battle lines of the living god
37  then david added jehovah who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear he is the one who will rescue me from the hand of this philisʹtine
at this saul said to david go and may jehovah be with you
38  saul now clothed david with his garments
he put a copper helmet on his head after which he clothed him with a coat of mail
39  then david strapped on his sword over his garments and tried to go but could not for he was not used to them
david said to saul i am unable to go in these things for i am not used to them
so david took them off
40  he then took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the streambed and placed them in the pouch of his shepherds bag and his sling was in his hand
and he began approaching the philisʹtine
41  the philisʹtine came closer and closer to david and his shieldbearer was ahead of him
42  when the philisʹtine looked and saw david he sneered at him in contempt because he was just a ruddy and handsome boy
43  so the philisʹtine said to david am i a dog so that you are coming against me with sticks with that the philisʹtine cursed david by his gods
44  the philisʹtine said to david just come to me and i will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field
45  david replied to the philisʹtine you are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin but i am coming against you in the name of jehovah of armies the god of the battle line of israel whom you have taunted
46  this very day jehovah will surrender you into my hand and i will strike you down and cut off your head and on this day i will give the corpses of the camp of the philisʹtines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth and people of all the earth will know that there is a god in israel
47  and all those gathered here will know that it is not with the sword or the spear that jehovah saves for the battle belongs to jehovah and he will give all of you into our hand
48  then the philisʹtine rose and drew steadily closer to meet david but david ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the philisʹtine
49  david thrust his hand into his bag and took a stone from there and slung it
he struck the philisʹtine in the forehead and the stone sank into his forehead and he fell facedown on the ground
50  so david prevailed over the philisʹtine with a sling and a stone he struck down the philisʹtine and put him to death though there was no sword in davids hand
51  david continued running and stood over him
then he took hold of the philisʹtines sword and pulled it out of its sheath and made sure that he was dead by cutting off his head with it
when the philisʹtines saw that their mighty one had died they fled
52  at that the men of israel and of judah rose and broke into shouting and pursued the philisʹtines all the way from the valley to the gates of ekʹron and the slain of the philisʹtines lay fallen along the road from shaʹaraʹim as far as gath and ekʹron
53  after the israelites returned from hotly pursuing the philisʹtines they pillaged their camps
54  then david took the head of the philisʹtine and brought it to jerusalem but he put the philisʹtines weapons in his own tent
55  at the moment that saul saw david go out to meet the philisʹtine he said to abʹner the chief of the army whose son is this boy abʹner abʹner replied as surely as you live o king i do not know
56  the king said find out whose son the young man is
57  so as soon as david returned from striking down the philisʹtine abʹner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philisʹtine in his hand
58  saul now said to him whose son are you boy to which david said the son of your servant jesʹse the bethʹlehemite
9  there was a man of benjamin named kish the son of abiʹel the son of zeʹror son of becoʹrath son of aphiʹah a benʹjaminite and a very wealthy man
2  he had a son named saul who was young and handsomethere was no man among the israelites more handsome than heand he stood head and shoulders taller than all the people
3  when the donkeys belonging to sauls father kish got lost kish said to his son saul please take with you one of the attendants and go look for the donkeys
4  they passed through the mountainous region of eʹphraim and through the land of shalʹishah and they did not find them
they traveled through the land of shaʹalim but the donkeys were not there
they passed through the entire land of the benʹjaminites and they did not find them
5  they came into the land of zuph and saul said to his attendant who was with him come let us return so that my father does not start worrying about us rather than the donkeys
6  but the attendant replied look there is a man of god in this city a man who is held in honor
all that he says is sure to come true
let us go there now
perhaps he can tell us which way to go
7  at this saul said to his attendant if we go what can we take to the man there is no bread in our bags there is nothing to take as a gift to the man of the true god
what do we have
8  so the attendant answered saul again look there is a quarter of a shekel of silver in my hand
i will give it to the man of the true god and he will tell us which way to go
9  in former times in israel this was what a man would say when going to seek god come and let us go to the seer
for the prophet of today used to be called a seer in former times
10  then saul said to his attendant what you said is good
let us go
so they went to the city where the man of the true god was
11  while they were going up the ascent to the city they met girls going out to draw water
so they said to them is the seer in this place
12  they answered he is
look he is just ahead of you
hurry now for today he has come to the city because the people are making a sacrifice today on the high place
13  as soon as you come into the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat
the people will not eat until he comes for he is the one who blesses the sacrifice
once that is done those who are invited may eat
so now go up right away and you will find him
14  so they went up to the city
as they were coming into the middle of the city there was samuel coming out to meet them to go up to the high place
15  the day before saul came jehovah had told samuel
16  tomorrow about this time i will send to you a man from the land of benjamin
you must anoint him as leader over my people israel and he will save my people from the hand of the philisʹtines
for i have seen the affliction of my people and their outcry has reached me
17  when samuel saw saul jehovah told him here is the man of whom i said to you this is the one who will govern my people
18  then saul approached samuel in the middle of the gate and said tell me please where is the house of the seer
19  samuel answered saul i am the seer
go up ahead of me to the high place and you will eat with me today
i will send you away in the morning and i will tell you all that you want to know
20  as for the donkeys that were lost three days ago do not worry about them for they have been found
and to whom does all that is desirable of israel belong is it not to you and to the whole house of your father
21  at this saul answered am i not a benʹjaminite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of benjamin so why have you spoken to me in this way
22  then samuel took saul and his attendant and brought them to the dining hall and gave them a place at the head of those invited there were about 30 men
23  samuel said to the cook bring the portion that i gave you and told you set it aside
24  at that the cook lifted up the leg and what was on it and set it before saul
and samuel said what has been reserved has been set before you
eat because they have reserved it for you for this occasion
for i told them i invited guests
so saul ate with samuel on that day
25  then they went down from the high place to the city and he continued to speak with saul on the housetop
26  they rose early and at daybreak samuel called to saul on the housetop saying get ready so that i may send you away
so saul got ready and both he and samuel went outside
27  while they were descending toward the outskirts of the city samuel said to saul tell the attendant to go on ahead of us so he went on ahead
but you stand still now so that i may let you hear the word of god
28  in those days the philisʹtines assembled their armies for war against israel
so aʹchish said to david you know of course that you and your men will go out into battle with me
2  at that david said to aʹchish you surely know what your servant will do
aʹchish said to david that is why i will appoint you as my permanent bodyguard
3  now samuel had died and all israel had mourned him and had buried him in raʹmah his own city
and saul had removed the spirit mediums and the fortunetellers from the land
4  the philisʹtines assembled and went and set up camp in shuʹnem
so saul assembled all israel and they set up camp in gilboʹa
5  when saul saw the camp of the philisʹtines he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly
6  although saul would inquire of jehovah jehovah never answered him either in dreams or by the uʹrim or through the prophets
7  finally saul said to his servants find me a woman who is a spirit medium and i will go and consult her
his servants replied look there is a woman who is a spirit medium in endor
8  so saul disguised himself and put on other garments and went to the woman by night with two of his men
he said use divination please by acting as a spirit medium and bring up for me the one whom i designate to you
9  however the woman said to him you must know what saul did how he removed the spirit mediums and the fortunetellers from the land
why then are you trying to trap me to have me put to death
10  saul then swore to her by jehovah saying as surely as jehovah is alive you will not incur any guilt in this matter
11  at this the woman said whom should i bring up for you he replied bring up samuel for me
12  when the woman saw samuel she cried out at the top of her voice and said to saul why did you trick me you are saul
13  the king said to her do not be afraid but what do you see the woman replied to saul i see one like a god coming up out of the earth
14  at once he asked her what does he look like to which she said it is an old man coming up and he is clothed in a sleeveless coat
at that saul realized that it was samuel and he bowed low with his face to the ground and prostrated himself
15  then samuel said to saul why have you disturbed me by having me brought up saul replied i am in great trouble
the philisʹtines are fighting against me and god has departed from me and no longer answers me either through the prophets or in dreams so that is why i am calling on you to let me know what i should do
16  and samuel said why do you inquire of me now that jehovah has departed from you and has become your adversary
17  jehovah will do for himself what he foretold through me jehovah will rip the kingdom out of your hands and give it to one of your fellow men david
18  because you did not obey the voice of jehovah and you did not execute his burning anger against the amalʹekites that is why jehovah is doing this to you this day
19  jehovah will also give both israel and you into the hand of the philisʹtines and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me
jehovah will also give the army of israel into the hands of the philisʹtines
20  at once saul fell full length on the ground and became very much afraid because of samuels words
and there was no strength left in him because he had not eaten food all day and all night
21  when the woman came to saul and saw that he had been greatly disturbed she said to him here your servant has obeyed what you said and i risked my life and did what you told me to do
22  now please listen to what your servant has to say
let me set before you a piece of bread then eat so that you will have some strength to go on your way
23  but he refused and said i am not going to eat
however his servants and also the woman kept urging him
finally he listened to them and got up from the ground and sat on the bed
24  the woman had a fattened calf in the house so she quickly slaughtered it and took flour and kneaded dough and baked it into unleavened bread
25  she served them to saul and his servants and they ate
after that they rose up and left during the night
27  however david said in his heart one day i will perish by sauls hand
the best thing for me is to escape to the land of the philisʹtines then saul will give up looking for me in all the territory of israel and i will escape from his hand
2  so david rose up with the 600 men who were with him and went over to aʹchish the son of maʹoch the king of gath
3  david stayed with aʹchish in gath he and his men each man with his household
with david were his two wives ahinʹoam of jezʹreel and abʹigail the carʹmelite naʹbals widow
4  when report was made to saul that david had run away to gath he stopped searching for him
5  then david said to aʹchish if i have found favor in your eyes let them give me a place in one of the cities of the countryside so that i may live there
why should your servant live in the royal city with you
6  so aʹchish gave him zikʹlag on that day
that is why zikʹlag belongs to the kings of judah down to this day
7  the length of time that david lived in the countryside of the philisʹtines was a year and four months
8  david would go up with his men to raid the geshʹurites the girʹzites and the amalʹekites for they were inhabiting the land that extended from teʹlam as far as shur and down to the land of egypt
9  when david would attack the land he preserved neither man nor woman alive but he took the flocks herds donkeys camels and clothing after which he would return to aʹchish
10  then aʹchish would ask where did you make a raid today david would reply against the south of judah or against the south of the jerahʹmeelites or against the south of the kenʹites
11  david did not spare alive any man or woman to be brought to gath saying that they may not tell them about us and say this is what david did
and that was his practice the whole time he lived in the countryside of the philisʹtines
12  so aʹchish believed david saying to himself he has certainly become a stench among his people israel so he will always be my servant
7  so the men of kirʹiathjeʹarim came and took the ark of jehovah up into the house of abinʹadab on the hill and they sanctified his son eleaʹzar to guard the ark of jehovah
2  a long time elapsed 20 years in all from the day of the arks coming to kirʹiathjeʹarim and all the house of israel began to seek after jehovah
3  samuel then said to all the house of israel if you are returning to jehovah with all your heart put away the foreign gods and the ashʹtoreth images from among you and direct your heart unswervingly to jehovah and serve only him and he will rescue you from the hand of the philisʹtines
4  at that the israelites got rid of the baʹals and the ashʹtoreth images and served only jehovah
5  then samuel said gather all israel together at mizʹpah and i will pray to jehovah in your behalf
6  so they gathered together at mizʹpah and they drew water and poured it out before jehovah and kept a fast on that day
there they said we have sinned against jehovah
and samuel began serving as judge over the israelites in mizʹpah
7  when the philisʹtines heard that the israelites had gathered together at mizʹpah the lords of the philisʹtines went up against israel
when the israelites heard of it they were afraid because of the philisʹtines
8  so the israelites said to samuel do not stop calling to jehovah our god to help us and to save us from the hand of the philisʹtines
9  then samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to jehovah and samuel called to jehovah for help in behalf of israel and jehovah answered him
10  as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philisʹtines advanced for battle against israel
jehovah now caused it to thunder loudly on that day against the philisʹtines and he threw them into confusion and they were defeated before israel
11  at that the men of israel went out from mizʹpah and pursued the philisʹtines striking them down as far as south of bethcar
12  then samuel took a stone and set it between mizʹpah and jeshʹanah and named it ebeneʹzer for he said until now jehovah has helped us
13  thus the philisʹtines were subdued and they did not come again into the territory of israel and the hand of jehovah continued against the philisʹtines all the days of samuel
14  also the cities that the philisʹtines had taken from israel were returned to israel from ekʹron to gath and israel recovered their territory from the hand of the philisʹtines
there was also peace between israel and the amʹorites
15  samuel kept on judging israel throughout his life
16  each year he traveled in a circuit to bethʹel gilʹgal and mizʹpah and he judged israel in all these places
17  but he would return to raʹmah because his house was there and there he also judged israel
he built an altar there to jehovah
23  in time david was told the philisʹtines are fighting against keiʹlah and they are raiding the threshing floors
2  so david inquired of jehovah should i go and strike down these philisʹtines jehovah said to david go strike down the philisʹtines and rescue keiʹlah
3  but the men of david said to him look we are afraid while here in judah how much more so if we go to keiʹlah against the battle line of the philisʹtines
4  so david inquired once again of jehovah
jehovah now answered him rise up go down to keiʹlah because i will give the philisʹtines into your hand
5  so david went with his men to keiʹlah and fought against the philisʹtines he carried off their livestock and struck them down with a great slaughter and david rescued the inhabitants of keiʹlah
6  now when abiʹathar the son of ahimʹelech ran away to david at keiʹlah he had an ephʹod with him
7  saul was told david has come to keiʹlah
then saul said god has handed him over to me for he has trapped himself by entering a city with gates and bars
8  so saul summoned all the people to war to go down to keiʹlah and besiege david and his men
9  when david learned that saul was plotting against him he said to abiʹathar the priest bring the ephʹod here
10  then david said o jehovah the god of israel your servant has indeed heard that saul intends to come to keiʹlah to destroy the city because of me
11  will the leaders of keiʹlah surrender me into his hand will saul come down as your servant has heard o jehovah the god of israel please tell your servant
to this jehovah said he will come down
12  david asked will the leaders of keiʹlah surrender me and my men into sauls hand jehovah replied they will surrender you
13  at once david rose up with his men about 600 in number and they left keiʹlah and moved about wherever they could
when saul was told that david had escaped from keiʹlah he did not go out after him
14  david stayed in the wilderness in places difficult to approach in the mountainous region of the wilderness of ziph
saul searched for him constantly but jehovah did not give him into his hand
15  david was aware that saul had gone out to seek his life while david was in the wilderness of ziph at hoʹresh
16  jonʹathan the son of saul now went out to david at hoʹresh and he helped him find strength in jehovah
17  he said to him do not be afraid for my father saul will not find you you will be king over israel and i will become second to you and my father saul also knows that
18  then the two of them made a covenant before jehovah and david stayed in hoʹresh and jonʹathan went to his home
19  the men of ziph later went up to saul at gibʹeah and said is not david hiding near us in the places difficult to approach at hoʹresh on the hill of hachiʹlah which is south of jeshiʹmon
20  whenever it pleases you to come down o king come and we will surrender him into the hand of the king
21  at this saul said may you be blessed by jehovah for you have shown compassion to me
22  please go and try to find out exactly where he is and who saw him there for i have been told that he is very cunning
23  carefully ascertain where all his hiding places are and return to me with the evidence
i will then go with you and if he is in the land i will search him out among all the thousands of judah
24  so they left and went to ziph ahead of saul while david and his men were in the wilderness of maʹon in the arʹabah to the south of jeshiʹmon
25  then saul came with his men to look for him
when david was told he at once went down to the crag and stayed in the wilderness of maʹon
when saul heard this he chased after david into the wilderness of maʹon
26  as saul came to one side of the mountain david and his men were on the other side of the mountain
david was hurrying to get away from saul but saul and his men were closing in on david and his men to capture them
27  but a messenger came to saul saying come quickly for the philisʹtines have made a raid on the land
28  at that saul stopped chasing after david and went to confront the philisʹtines
that is why that place was named the crag of the divisions
29  then david made his way up from there and stayed in the places difficult to approach at engedʹi
22  so david went from there escaping to the cave of adulʹlam
when his brothers and his fathers entire house heard of it they went down there to him
2  and all those who were in trouble and in debt and who had a grievance gathered to him and he became their chief
there were about 400 men with him
3  david later went from there to mizʹpeh in moʹab and said to the king of moʹab please let my father and mother stay with you until i know what god will do for me
4  so he left them with the king of moʹab and they stayed with him the whole time that david was in the stronghold
5  in time gad the prophet said to david do not stay in the stronghold
go from there into the land of judah
so david left and went into the forest of heʹreth
6  saul heard that david and the men with him had been found
saul was then sitting in gibʹeah under the tamarisk tree on the high place with his spear in his hand and all his servants were stationed around him
7  then saul said to his servants stationed around him listen please you benʹjaminites
will the son of jesʹse also give fields and vineyards to all of you will he appoint all of you as chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds
8  all of you have conspired against me no one informed me when my own son made a covenant with the son of jesʹse not one of you has sympathy for me and informs me that my own son has incited my own servant against me to ambush me as is now the case
9  then doʹeg the eʹdomite who was stationed there over the servants of saul answered i saw the son of jesʹse come to nob to ahimʹelech the son of ahiʹtub
10  and he inquired of jehovah for him and gave him provisions
he even gave him the sword of goliʹath the philisʹtine
11  at once the king sent for ahimʹelech son of ahiʹtub the priest and all the priests of his fathers house who were in nob
so all of them came to the king
12  saul now said listen please you son of ahiʹtub to which he replied here i am my lord
13  saul said to him why have you conspired against me you and the son of jesʹse by giving him bread and a sword and by making an inquiry of god for him he opposes me and waits in ambush as is now the case
14  at this ahimʹelech answered the king who among all your servants is as trustworthy as david he is the kings soninlaw and a chief over your bodyguard and honored in your house
15  was today the first time i inquired of god for him what you are saying is unthinkable on my part do not let the king hold anything against his servant and against my fathers entire house for your servant did not know a single thing about any of this
16  but the king said you will surely die ahimʹelech you along with all your fathers house
17  with that the king said to the guards stationed around him turn and kill the priests of jehovah because they have sided with david they knew that he was a runaway and they did not inform me but the kings servants did not want to lift their hands to assault the priests of jehovah
18  then the king said to doʹeg you turn and assault the priests immediately doʹeg the eʹdomite went and assaulted the priests himself
he killed on that day 85 men wearing the linen ephʹod
19  he also struck nob the city of the priests with the sword man as well as woman child as well as infant bull donkey and sheep he put to the sword
20  however one son of ahimʹelech the son of ahiʹtub whose name was abiʹathar escaped and ran away to follow david
21  abiʹathar told david saul has killed the priests of jehovah
22  at this david said to abiʹathar i knew on that day when doʹeg the eʹdomite was there that he would be sure to tell saul
i am personally responsible for the death of everyone in your fathers house
23  stay with me
do not be afraid for whoever seeks your life seeks my life you are under my protection
6  the ark of jehovah was in philisʹtine territory for seven months
2  the philisʹtines called the priests and the diviners and asked what should we do with the ark of jehovah let us know how we should send it back to its place
3  they replied if you send the ark of the covenant of jehovah the god of israel away do not send it back without an offering
you should by all means return to him a guilt offering
only then will you be healed and it will be made known to you why his hand has not turned away from you
4  so they asked what guilt offering should we send to him they said according to the number of the lords of the philisʹtines send five golden piles and five golden mice for the same scourge has afflicted every one of you and your lords
5  you should make images of your piles and images of your mice that are bringing the land to ruin and you should honor the god of israel
perhaps he will lighten the weight of his hand that is on you and your god and your land
6  why should you harden your heart as egypt and pharʹaoh hardened their hearts when he dealt harshly with them they had to send israel away and they departed
7  now prepare a new wagon and two cows that have calves and have never been under a yoke
then hitch the cows to the wagon but take their calves back home away from them
8  take the ark of jehovah and place it on the wagon and put the golden articles that you are sending to him as a guilt offering in a box next to it
then send it on its way
9  and watch if it goes up the road to bethsheʹmesh to its own territory then he is the one who has done this great evil to us
but if not we will know that it was not his hand that struck us it happened to us by coincidence
10  the men did accordingly
they took two cows that had calves and hitched them to the wagon and the calves they penned up at home
11  then they put the ark of jehovah on the wagon as well as the box containing the golden mice and the images of their piles
12  and the cows went straight ahead on the road to bethsheʹmesh
they stayed on the one highway mooing as they went they did not turn either to the right or to the left
all the while the lords of the philisʹtines were walking behind them as far as the boundary of bethsheʹmesh
13  the people of bethsheʹmesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley plain
when they raised their eyes and saw the ark they were overjoyed at seeing it
14  the wagon came into the field of joshua the bethsheʹmite and stopped there near a large stone
so they chopped up the wood of the wagon and they offered the cows as a burnt offering to jehovah
15  the levites took down the ark of jehovah and the box that was with it which contained the golden articles and they put them on the large stone
the men of bethsheʹmesh offered up burnt offerings and made sacrifices on that day to jehovah
16  when the five lords of the philisʹtines saw it they returned to ekʹron on that day
17  now these are the golden piles that the philisʹtines sent as a guilt offering to jehovah one for ashʹdod one for gazʹa one for ashʹkelon one for gath one for ekʹron
18  and the number of the golden mice corresponded to the number of all the cities of the philisʹtines that belonged to the five lordsboth the fortified cities and the villages in the open country
and the large stone upon which they rested the ark of jehovah serves as a witness down to this day in the field of joshua the bethsheʹmite
19  but god struck down the men of bethsheʹmesh because they had looked upon the ark of jehovah
he struck down 50070 among the people and the people began mourning because jehovah had struck them down with a great slaughter
20  so the men of bethsheʹmesh asked who will be able to stand before jehovah this holy god and to whom will he go away from us
21  so they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kirʹiathjeʹarim saying the philisʹtines have returned the ark of jehovah
come down and take it up with you
31  now the philisʹtines were fighting against israel
and the men of israel fled from before the philisʹtines and many fell slain on mount gilboʹa
2  the philisʹtines kept in close range of saul and his sons and the philisʹtines struck down jonʹathan abinʹadab and malʹchishuʹa sauls sons
3  the fighting grew fierce against saul and the archers found him and he was severely wounded by the archers
4  then saul said to his armorbearer draw your sword and run me through with it so that these uncircumcised men may not come and run me through and deal ruthlessly with me
but his armorbearer was unwilling because he was very much afraid
so saul took the sword and fell on it
5  when his armorbearer saw that saul was dead he too fell on his own sword and died with him
6  thus saul his three sons his armorbearer and all his men died together on that day
7  when the people of israel who were in the region of the valley and in the region of the jordan saw that the men of israel had fled and that saul and his sons had died they began to abandon the cities and flee the philisʹtines then came and occupied them
8  the next day when the philisʹtines came to strip the slain they found saul and his three sons fallen on mount gilboʹa
9  so they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent word throughout the land of the philisʹtines to spread the news in the houses of their idols and among the people
10  then they put his armor in the house of the ashʹtoreth images and fastened his corpse to the wall of bethshan
11  when the inhabitants of jaʹbeshgilʹead heard what the philisʹtines had done to saul
12  all the warriors rose and traveled all night and took the bodies of saul and his sons off the wall of bethshan
they returned to jaʹbesh and burned them there
13  then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in jaʹbesh and they fasted for seven days
21  david later came to nob to ahimʹelech the priest
ahimʹelech began to tremble when he met david and he said to him why are you by yourself and no one is with you
2  david replied to ahimʹelech the priest the king instructed me to do something but he said do not let anyone know anything about the mission on which i am sending you and about the instructions i have given you
i made an appointment with my young men to meet at a certain place
3  now if there are five loaves of bread at your disposal just give them to me or whatever is available
4  but the priest answered david there is no ordinary bread on hand but there is holy breadprovided that the young men have kept away from women
5  david answered the priest women have certainly been kept away from us as on previous occasions when i went out on a campaign
if the bodies of the young men are holy even when the mission is ordinary how much more so today should they be holy
6  so the priest gave him the holy bread because there was no bread there except the showbread which had been removed from jehovahs presence to be replaced by fresh bread on the day it was taken away
7  now one of sauls servants was there on that day detained before jehovah
his name was doʹeg the eʹdomite the chief of sauls shepherds
8  david then said to ahimʹelech is there a spear or a sword here at your disposal i did not take my own sword or my weapons with me because the kings mission was urgent
9  to this the priest said the sword of goliʹath the philisʹtine whom you struck down in the valley of eʹlah is here wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephʹod
if you want to take it for yourself take it because it is the only one here
david said there is none like it
give it to me
10  that day david rose up and continued his flight from saul and he eventually came to king aʹchish of gath
11  the servants of aʹchish said to him is this not david the king of the land is he not the one they sang about when they danced sayingsaul has struck down his thousandsand david his tens of thousands
12  david took these words to heart and he became very much afraid of king aʹchish of gath
13  so he disguised his sanity in their presence and acted insane while among them
he was making marks on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard
14  finally aʹchish said to his servants you see that this man is crazy why bring him to me
15  do i have a shortage of crazy men that i need to have this one acting crazy before me should this man enter my house
25  in time samuel died and all israel gathered together to mourn for him and to bury him at his house in raʹmah
then david rose and went down to the wilderness of paʹran
2  now there was a man in maʹon whose work was in carʹmel
the man was very wealthy he had 3000 sheep and 1000 goats and he was then shearing his sheep at carʹmel
3  the mans name was naʹbal and his wifes name was abʹigail
the wife was discerning and beautiful but the husband a caʹlebite was harsh and he behaved badly
4  david heard in the wilderness that naʹbal was shearing his sheep
5  so david sent ten young men to him and david told the young men go up to carʹmel and when you come to naʹbal ask him in my name about his welfare
6  then say may you live long and may you be well and may your household be well and may all that you have be well
7  now i hear that you are doing your shearing
when your shepherds were with us we did not harm them and they found nothing missing the whole time they were in carʹmel
8  ask your young men and they will tell you
may my young men find favor in your eyes because we have come at a joyous time
please give to your servants and to your son david whatever you can spare
9  so davids young men went and told all of this to naʹbal in davids name
when they finished
10  naʹbal answered davids servants who is david and who is the son of jesʹse nowadays many servants are breaking away from their masters
11  do i have to take my bread and my water and the meat that i butchered for my shearers and give it to men who come from who knows where
12  at that davids young men returned and reported all these words to him
13  david immediately said to his men everyone strap on your sword so they all strapped on their swords and david also strapped on his own sword and about 400 men went up with david while 200 men stayed with the baggage
14  meanwhile one of the servants reported to abʹigail naʹbals wife look david sent messengers from the wilderness to wish our master well but he screamed insults at them
15  those men were very good to us
they never harmed us and we did not miss a single thing the whole time we were together with them in the fields
16  they were like a protective wall around us both by night and by day the whole time we were with them shepherding the flock
17  now decide what you are going to do for disaster has been determined against our master and against all his house and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him
18  so abʹigail quickly took 200 loaves of bread two large jars of wine five dressed sheep five seah measures of roasted grain 100 cakes of raisins and 200 cakes of pressed figs and put all of it on the donkeys
19  then she said to her servants go on ahead of me i will follow you
but she said nothing to her husband naʹbal
20  while she was riding on the donkey and going down under cover of the mountain just then david and his men were coming down toward her and she met them
21  now david had been saying it was for nothing that i guarded everything that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness
not a single thing belonging to him went missing and yet he repays me evil for good
22  may god do the same and more to the enemies of david if i allow a single male of his to survive until the morning
23  when abʹigail caught sight of david she hurried down off the donkey and threw herself facedown before david bowing to the ground
24  she then fell at his feet and said my lord let the blame be on me let your servant girl speak to you and listen to the words of your servant girl
25  please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless naʹbal for he is just like his name
naʹbal is his name and senselessness is with him
but i your servant girl did not see my lords young men whom you sent
26  and now my lord as surely as jehovah is living and as you are living it is jehovah who has held you back from incurring bloodguilt and from taking revenge with your own hand
may your enemies and those seeking injury to my lord become like naʹbal
27  now let this gift that your servant girl has brought to my lord be given to the young men who are following my lord
28  pardon please the transgression of your servant girl for jehovah will without fail make for my lord a lasting house because my lord is fighting the wars of jehovah and no evil has been found in you all your days
29  when someone rises up to pursue you and seeks your life the life of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of life with jehovah your god but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away like stones from a sling
30  and when jehovah has done for my lord all the good things he has promised and he appoints you as leader over israel
31  you will have no remorse or regret in your heart for shedding blood without cause and for letting the hand of my lord take revenge
when jehovah confers good upon my lord remember your servant girl
32  at this david said to abʹigail praise jehovah the god of israel who sent you this day to meet me
33  and blessed be your good sense may you be blessed for restraining me this day from incurring bloodguilt and from taking revenge with my own hands
34  otherwise as surely as jehovah the god of israel who held me back from harming you is living if you had not come quickly to meet me by morning there would not have remained a single male belonging to naʹbal
35  with that david accepted from her what she had brought him and said to her go up in peace to your house
see i have listened to you and i will grant your request
36  abʹigail later went back to naʹbal who was feasting like a king in his house and naʹbal was in a good mood and was as drunk as could be
she did not tell him a single thing until the morning light
37  in the morning when naʹbal was sober his wife told him these things
and his heart became like a dead mans and he lay paralyzed like a stone
38  about ten days later jehovah struck naʹbal and he died
39  when david heard that naʹbal had died he said praise jehovah who has pleaded my case of reproach from naʹbal and has kept his servant from doing anything bad and jehovah has brought the badness of naʹbal back on his own head then david sent word to propose to abʹigail to take her as his wife
40  so davids servants came to abʹigail at carʹmel and said to her david has sent us to you to take you as his wife
41  she immediately rose up and bowed with her face to the ground and said here is your slave as a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord
42  then abʹigail quickly rose up and rode on her donkey with five of her female servants walking behind her she accompanied the messengers of david and became his wife
43  david had also married ahinʹoam from jezʹreel and both women became his wives
44  but saul had given his daughter miʹchal davids wife to palʹti the son of laʹish who was from galʹlim
13  saul was 


years old when he became king and for two years he reigned over israel
2  saul chose 3000 men out of israel 2000 of these were with saul at michʹmash and in the mountainous region of bethʹel and 1000 were with jonʹathan at gibʹeah of benjamin
he sent the rest of the people away each one to his tent
3  then jonʹathan struck down the garrison of the philisʹtines that was in geʹba and the philisʹtines heard about it
and saul had the horn blown throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear
4  all israel heard the news saul has struck down a garrison of the philisʹtines and now israel has become a stench among the philisʹtines
so the people were summoned to follow saul at gilʹgal
5  the philisʹtines also gathered together to fight against israel with 30000 war chariots and 6000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore and they went up and camped in michʹmash to the east of bethaʹven
6  and the men of israel saw that they were in trouble because they were hardpressed so the people hid in the caves the hollows the crags the cellars and the cisterns
7  some of the hebrews even crossed the jordan to the land of gad and gilʹead
but saul was still in gilʹgal and all the people following him were trembling
8  he continued waiting for seven days until the designated time that samuel had set but samuel did not come to gilʹgal and the people were scattering from him
9  finally saul said bring to me the burnt sacrifice and the communion sacrifices
and he offered up the burnt sacrifice
10  but as soon as he had finished offering up the burnt sacrifice samuel arrived
so saul went out to meet him and bless him
11  then samuel said what have you done saul replied i saw that the people were deserting me and you did not come within the designated time and the philisʹtines were gathering together at michʹmash
12  so i said to myself now the philisʹtines will come down against me at gilʹgal and i have not sought the favor of jehovah
so i felt obligated to offer up the burnt sacrifice
13  at this samuel said to saul you have acted foolishly
you have not obeyed the commandment that jehovah your god gave you
if you had jehovah would have made your kingdom firm over israel forever
14  but now your kingdom will not last
jehovah will find a man agreeable to his heart and jehovah will commission him as a leader over his people because you did not obey what jehovah commanded you
15  then samuel rose and went his way up from gilʹgal to gibʹeah of benjamin and saul took the count of the people those still with him were about 600 men
16  saul his son jonʹathan and the people still with them were dwelling in geʹba of benjamin and the philisʹtines had encamped at michʹmash
17  and the raiding parties would go out from the camp of the philisʹtines in three bands
one band would turn toward the road to ophʹrah to the land of shuʹal
18  another band would turn toward the road of bethhoʹron and the third band would turn toward the road leading to the boundary that overlooks the valley of zeboʹim toward the wilderness
19  now there was not a metalworker to be found in all the land of israel because the philisʹtines had said so that the hebrews may not make a sword or a spear
20  and all the israelites had to go down to the philisʹtines to get their plowshares mattocks axes or sickles sharpened
21  the price for sharpening was a pim for the plowshares for the mattocks for the threetoothed instruments for the axes and for fixing fast the oxgoad
22  and on the day of battle not a sword or a spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with saul and jonʹathan only saul and his son jonʹathan had weapons
23  now a garrison of the philisʹtines had gone out to the ravine pass of michʹmash
14  one day jonʹathan the son of saul said to the attendant carrying his weapons come and let us cross over to the philisʹtine outpost on the other side
but he did not tell his father
2  saul was staying on the outskirts of gibʹeah under the pomegranate tree in migʹron and there were about 600 men with him
3  and ahiʹjah the son of ahiʹtub the brother of ichʹabod the son of phinʹehas the son of eʹli the priest of jehovah in shiʹloh was carrying the ephʹod
and the people did not know that jonʹathan had gone
4  now between the passages that jonʹathan was trying to cross over to reach the outpost of the philisʹtines there was a toothlike crag on one side and a toothlike crag on the other side the name of the one was boʹzez and the name of the other was seʹneh
5  the one crag was a pillar on the north facing michʹmash and the other was on the south facing geʹba
6  so jonʹathan said to his armorbearer come and let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men
perhaps jehovah will act in our behalf for nothing can hinder jehovah from saving by many or by few
7  at this his armorbearer said to him do whatever your heart impels you to do
turn wherever you wish and i will follow you wherever your heart impels you
8  then jonʹathan said we will cross over to those men and reveal our presence to them
9  if they say to us stand still until we come to you we will stand where we are and not go up to them
10  but if they say come up against us we will go up because jehovah will give them into our hand
this will be our sign
11  then both of them revealed their presence to the outpost of the philisʹtines
the philisʹtines said look the hebrews are coming out from the holes where they have been hiding
12  so the men of the outpost said to jonʹathan and his armorbearer come up to us and we will teach you a lesson at once jonʹathan said to his armorbearer follow me for jehovah will give them into the hand of israel
13  and jonʹathan climbed up on his hands and feet and his armorbearer was behind him and the philisʹtines began to fall before jonʹathan and his armorbearer was putting them to death behind him
14  in the first attack that jonʹathan and his armorbearer made they struck down about 20 men within about half the plowing line in an acre of field
15  then terror spread in the field camp and among all the people of the outpost and even the raiding parties were terrified
the earth began quaking and a terror from god ensued
16  sauls watchmen in gibʹeah of benjamin saw that the turmoil was spreading in every direction
17  saul said to the people with him take a count please and see who has left us
when they took the count they saw that jonʹathan and his armorbearer were not there
18  saul now said to ahiʹjah bring the ark of the true god near for the ark of the true god was with the israelites at that time
19  and while saul was speaking to the priest the turmoil in the camp of the philisʹtines was growing greater and greater
then saul said to the priest stop what you are doing
20  so saul and all the people with him assembled and went into the battle where they found that the philisʹtines had turned their swords against one another and the confusion was very great
21  also the hebrews who had previously sided with the philisʹtines and who had come up with them into the camp were going over to israel under saul and jonʹathan
22  all the men of israel who had hidden in the mountainous region of eʹphraim heard that the philisʹtines had fled and they too joined in pursuing them in the battle
23  so jehovah saved israel on that day and the battle extended as far as bethaʹven
24  but the men of israel were hardpressed on that day for saul had put the people under this oath cursed is the man who eats any food before the evening and until i have taken vengeance on my enemies so none of the people ate any food
25  and all the people came into the forest and there was honey on the ground
26  when the people came into the forest they saw the honey dripping but no one would put his hand to his mouth because they feared the oath
27  but jonʹathan had not heard his father put the people under an oath so he stretched out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb
when he drew his hand back to his mouth his eyes brightened
28  at this one of the people said your father put the people under a strict oath saying cursed is the man who eats food today that is why the people are so tired
29  however jonʹathan said my father has brought great trouble on the land
look at how my eyes brightened because i tasted this little bit of honey
30  how much better if the people had eaten freely today from the spoil of their enemies that they found for then the slaughter of the philisʹtines would have been even greater
31  on that day they kept striking down the philisʹtines from michʹmash to aiʹjalon and the people became very tired
32  so the people began rushing greedily at the spoil and they took sheep and cattle and calves and slaughtered them on the ground and they ate the meat along with the blood
33  so it was reported to saul look the people are sinning against jehovah by eating meat with the blood
at this he said you have acted faithlessly
roll a large stone to me immediately
34  saul then said spread out among the people and say to them each of you must bring his bull and his sheep and slaughter them here and then eat them
do not sin against jehovah by eating meat with the blood
so each of them brought his bull with him that night and slaughtered it there
35  and saul built an altar to jehovah
this was the first altar he built to jehovah
36  saul later said let us go down after the philisʹtines by night and plunder them until the morning light
we will not leave a single survivor
to this they said do whatever seems good in your eyes
then the priest said let us approach the true god here
37  and saul inquired of god should i go down after the philisʹtines will you give them into the hand of israel but god did not answer him on that day
38  so saul said come here all you chiefs of the people and find out what sin has been committed today
39  for as surely as jehovah is alive who rescued israel even if it turns out to be jonʹathan my son he must die
but none of the people would answer him
40  then he said to all israel you will be on one side and my son jonʹathan and i will be on the other side
at this the people said to saul do whatever seems good in your eyes
41  saul then said to jehovah o god of israel answer with the thumʹmim then jonʹathan and saul were selected and the people went free
42  saul now said cast lots to decide between me and my son jonʹathan
and jonʹathan was selected
43  then saul said to jonʹathan tell me what have you done so jonʹathan told him i merely tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff in my hand
here i am i am ready to die
44  at this saul said thus may god do and may he add to it if you do not die jonʹathan
45  but the people said to saul should jonʹathan diethe one who brought this great victory to israel it is unthinkable as surely as jehovah is alive not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground for it was with god that he acted this day
with that the people rescued jonʹathan and he did not die
46  so saul stopped pursuing the philisʹtines and the philisʹtines went to their own territory
47  saul secured the kingship over israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against the moʹabites the amʹmonites the eʹdomites the kings of zoʹbah and the philisʹtines and wherever he went he defeated them
48  and he fought bravely and conquered the amalʹekites and rescued israel from the hand of their plunderers
49  the sons of saul were jonʹathan ishʹvi and malʹchishuʹa
and he had two daughters the name of the older one was meʹrab and the name of the younger one miʹchal
50  the name of sauls wife was ahinʹoam the daughter of ahimʹaaz
the name of the chief of his army was abʹner the son of ner the uncle of saul
51  kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abʹner was the son of abiʹel
52  there was fierce warfare with the philisʹtines all the days of saul
when saul saw any strong or courageous man he would recruit him into his service
29  the philisʹtines assembled all their armies at aʹphek while the israelites were camping by the spring in jezʹreel
2  and the lords of the philisʹtines were passing by with their hundreds and their thousands and david and his men were marching at the rear with aʹchish
3  but the princes of the philisʹtines said why are these hebrews here aʹchish replied to the princes of the philisʹtines this is david the servant of king saul of israel who has been with me for a year or more
i have not found any fault in him from the day he deserted to me until today
4  but the princes of the philisʹtines became indignant at him and they said to him make the man go back
let him return to the place where you assigned him
do not let him go down with us into the battle so that he will not turn against us during the battle
for what better way to put himself in favor with his lord than with the heads of our men
5  is this not the david about whom they sang when they danced saying saul has struck down his thousandsand david his tens of thousands
6  so aʹchish summoned david and said to him as surely as jehovah is living you are upright and i am pleased to have you go on the campaign with my army for i have not found any fault with you from the day you came to me until today
but the lords do not trust you
7  so return in peace and do not do anything to displease the lords of the philisʹtines
8  however david said to aʹchish why what have i done what fault have you found in your servant from the day that i came to you until today why should i not come with you and fight against the enemies of my lord the king
9  aʹchish answered david from my standpoint you have been as good as an angel of god
but the princes of the philisʹtines have said do not let him go up with us into the battle
10  now get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you rise up and leave early in the morning as soon as it is light
11  so david and his men rose up early in the morning to return to the land of the philisʹtines and the philisʹtines went up to jezʹreel
19  saul later spoke to jonʹathan his son and to all his servants about putting david to death
2  since sauls son jonʹathan was very fond of david jonʹathan told david my father saul wants to have you put to death
please be on your guard in the morning and go to a secret place and remain hidden
3  i will go out and stand next to my father in the field where you will be
i will talk about you to my father and if i learn anything i will be sure to tell you
4  so jonʹathan spoke well of david to his father saul
he said to him the king should not sin against his servant david for he has not sinned against you and what he has done for you has benefited you
5  he risked his life to strike down the philisʹtine so that jehovah brought about a great victory for all israel
you saw it and you were overjoyed
so why should you sin against innocent blood in having david put to death for no reason
6  saul listened to jonʹathan and saul swore as surely as jehovah is living he will not be put to death
7  afterward jonʹathan called david and told him all these things
so jonʹathan brought david to saul and he continued to serve him as before
8  in time war broke out again and david went out and fought against the philisʹtines and struck them down with a great slaughter and they fled from before him
9  and a bad spirit from jehovah came upon saul when he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand while david was playing music on the harp
10  saul tried to pin david to the wall with the spear but he eluded saul who drove the spear into the wall
david fled and escaped during that night
11  saul later sent messengers to davids house to watch it and to kill him in the morning but davids wife miʹchal told him if you do not escape tonight tomorrow you will be a dead man
12  immediately miʹchal let david down through the window so that he could run away and escape
13  miʹchal took the teraphim statue and placed it on the bed and she put a net of goat hair at the place of his head and she covered it with a garment
14  saul now sent messengers to take david but she said he is sick
15  so saul sent the messengers to see david and told them bring him to me on his bed to have him put to death
16  when the messengers came in there was the teraphim statue on the bed and a net of goat hair where his head would have been
17  saul said to miʹchal why did you trick me like this and send my enemy away so that he could escape miʹchal replied to saul he said to me send me away or i will kill you
18  now david had run away and escaped and he came to samuel at raʹmah
he told him all that saul had done to him
then he and samuel went away and they stayed in naiʹoth
19  in time it was reported to saul look david is in naiʹoth in raʹmah
20  at once saul sent messengers to seize david
when they saw the elderly ones of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing and presiding over them the spirit of god came to be upon sauls messengers and they began behaving as prophets as well
21  when they told it to saul he immediately sent other messengers and they too began behaving as prophets
so saul sent messengers again a third group and they too began behaving as prophets
22  finally he also went to raʹmah
when he reached the great cistern that is in seʹcu he asked where are samuel and david they replied there in naiʹoth in raʹmah
23  while saul was on his way from there to naiʹoth in raʹmah the spirit of god came upon him as well and he walked along behaving as a prophet until he came into naiʹoth in raʹmah
24  he also stripped off his garments and he too behaved as a prophet before samuel and he lay there naked all that day and all that night
that is why they say is saul also among the prophets
24  as soon as saul returned from pursuing the philisʹtines they told him look david is in the wilderness of engedʹi
2  so saul took 3000 men chosen from all israel and went to look for david and his men on the rocky cliffs of the mountain goats
3  saul came to the stone sheepfolds along the road where there was a cave and he went in to relieve himself while david and his men were sitting in the recesses at the back of the cave
4  davids men said to him this is the day on which jehovah is saying to you look i am giving your enemy into your hand and you can do to him whatever seems good to you
so david rose up and quietly cut off the edge of sauls sleeveless coat
5  but afterward davids heart kept striking him because he had cut off the edge of sauls sleeveless coat
6  he said to his men it is unthinkable from jehovahs standpoint that i should do such a thing to my lord the anointed of jehovah by lifting my hand against him for he is the anointed of jehovah
7  so david restrained his men with these words and he did not allow them to attack saul
as for saul he rose up from the cave and went on his way
8  then david got up and went out from the cave and called out after saul my lord the king when saul looked behind him david bowed down low with his face to the ground and prostrated himself
9  david said to saul why do you listen to the words of men who say look david is seeking to harm you
10  this very day your own eyes have seen how jehovah gave you into my hand in the cave
but when someone said to kill you i had pity on you and said i will not lift my hand against my lord for he is the anointed of jehovah
11  and look my father yes see the edge of your sleeveless coat in my hand for when i cut off the edge of your sleeveless coat i did not kill you
you can now see and understand that i do not intend to harm you or to rebel and i have not sinned against you whereas you are hunting me down to take my life
12  may jehovah judge between you and me and may jehovah take vengeance on you for me but my hand will not come against you
13  just as the ancient proverb says from the wicked comes wickedness but my hand will not come against you
14  after whom has the king of israel gone out whom are you chasing a dead dog a single flea
15  may jehovah be the judge and he will judge between you and me and he will see and will plead my case and judge me and rescue me from your hand
16  at the moment that david finished speaking these words to him saul said is this your voice my son david and saul began to weep loudly
17  he said to david you are more righteous than i am for you have treated me well and i have repaid you with evil
18  yes today you have told me of the good you did by not killing me when jehovah surrendered me into your hand
19  for what man finds his enemy and sends him on his way unharmed jehovah will reward you with good because of what you have done for me today
20  and now look i know that you will surely rule as king and that in your hand the kingdom of israel will endure
21  now swear to me by jehovah that you will not wipe out my descendants after me and that you will not annihilate my name out of my fathers house
22  so david swore to saul after which saul went home
but david and his men went up to the stronghold
5  when the philisʹtines captured the ark of the true god they brought it from ebeneʹzer to ashʹdod
2  the philisʹtines took the ark of the true god and brought it into the house of daʹgon and set it beside daʹgon
3  when the ashʹdodites got up early the next day there was daʹgon fallen facedown on the ground before the ark of jehovah
so they took daʹgon and returned him to his place
4  when they got up early in the morning on the following day there was daʹgon fallen facedown on the ground before the ark of jehovah
the head of daʹgon and the palms of both his hands were cut off and were lying on the threshold
only the fish part had been left intact
5  that is why to this day the priests of daʹgon and all those who enter the house of daʹgon do not walk on the threshold of daʹgon in ashʹdod
6  the hand of jehovah was heavy against the ashʹdodites and he devastated them by striking ashʹdod and its territories with piles
7  when the men of ashʹdod saw what was happening they said do not let the ark of the god of israel remain with us for his hand has dealt harshly with us and our god daʹgon
8  so they sent for and gathered all the lords of the philisʹtines and asked them what should we do with the ark of the god of israel they replied let the ark of the god of israel be moved to gath
so they moved the ark of the god of israel there
9  after they moved it there the hand of jehovah came against the city bringing great panic
he struck the men of the city from small to great and piles broke out on them
10  so they sent the ark of the true god to ekʹron but as soon as the ark of the true god came to ekʹron the ekʹronites began to cry out they have brought the ark of the god of israel to us to put us and our people to death
11  then they sent for and gathered all the lords of the philisʹtines and said send the ark of the god of israel away let it return to its place so that we and our people may not be put to death
for the terror of death had spread through the whole city the hand of the true god had been very heavy there
12  and the men who did not die had been struck with piles
and the citys cry for help ascended to the heavens
15  then samuel said to saul jehovah sent me to anoint you as king over his people israel now listen to what jehovah has to say
2  this is what jehovah of armies says i will call to account the amalʹekites for what they did to israel when they opposed them along their way coming up from egypt
3  now go and strike down the amalʹekites and devote them to destruction along with all that they have
you must not spare them you are to put them to death man as well as woman child as well as infant bull as well as sheep camel as well as donkey
4  saul summoned the people and counted them in telaʹim there were 200000 foot soldiers and 10000 men of judah
5  saul advanced as far as the city of amʹalek and set an ambush by the valley
6  saul then said to the kenʹites go depart from among the amalʹekites so that i do not sweep you away with them
for you showed loyal love to all the people of israel at the time they came up out of egypt
so the kenʹites departed from the midst of amʹalek
7  after that saul struck down the amalʹekites from havʹilah as far as shur which is next to egypt
8  he caught aʹgag the king of amʹalek alive but all the other people he devoted to destruction with the sword
9  however saul and the people spared aʹgag and the best of the flock the herd the fattened animals the rams and all that was good
they did not want to devote them to destruction
but all the goods that were worthless and unwanted these they devoted to destruction
10  then the word of jehovah came to samuel
11  i regret that i have made saul king for he has turned away from following me and he has not carried out my words
samuel became very upset and he kept crying out to jehovah all night long
12  when samuel got up early in the morning to meet saul samuel was told saul went to carʹmel and there he erected a monument for himself
then he turned around and went down to gilʹgal
13  when samuel finally came to him saul said to him may jehovah bless you
i have carried out the word of jehovah
14  but samuel said then what is this sound of the flock in my ears and the sound of the cattle that i hear
15  to this saul said they were brought from the amalʹekites because the people spared the best of the flock and the herd for sacrificing them to jehovah your god but what was left we devoted to destruction
16  at this samuel said to saul stop let me tell you what jehovah said to me last night
so he said to him speak
17  samuel continued were you not insignificant in your own eyes when you were made head of the tribes of israel and when jehovah anointed you as king over israel
18  jehovah later sent you on a mission and said go and devote the sinful amalʹekites to destruction
fight against them until you have exterminated them
19  so why did you not obey the voice of jehovah instead you rushed greedily toward the spoil and did what was bad in the eyes of jehovah
20  however saul said to samuel but i have obeyed the voice of jehovah i went on the mission to which jehovah sent me and i brought back aʹgag the king of amʹalek and i devoted the amalʹekites to destruction
21  but the people took sheep and cattle from the spoil the best of what was devoted to destruction to sacrifice to jehovah your god at gilʹgal
22  samuel then said does jehovah take as much pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of jehovah look to obey is better than a sacrifice and to pay attention than the fat of rams
23  for rebelliousness is the same as the sin of divination and pushing ahead presumptuously the same as using magical power and idolatry
because you have rejected the word of jehovah he has rejected you from being king
24  then saul said to samuel i have sinned for i have overstepped the order of jehovah and your words because i feared the people and listened to what they said
25  and now please pardon my sin and return with me so that i may bow down to jehovah
26  but samuel said to saul i will not return with you for you have rejected the word of jehovah and jehovah has rejected you from continuing as king over israel
27  as samuel was turning to go saul grabbed hold of the hem of his sleeveless coat but it ripped away
28  at this samuel said to him jehovah has ripped away the royal rule of israel from you today and he will give it to one of your fellow men who is better than you
29  moreover the excellency of israel will not prove false or change his mind for he is not a mere man that he should change his mind
30  at this he said i have sinned
but honor me please in front of the elders of my people and in front of israel
return with me and i will bow down to jehovah your god
31  so samuel returned behind saul and saul bowed down to jehovah
32  and samuel said bring aʹgag the king of amʹalek near to me
then aʹgag went to him reluctantly for aʹgag had been saying to himself surely the threat of death is past
33  however samuel said just as your sword has bereaved women of children so your mother will be most bereaved among women
with that samuel hacked aʹgag to pieces before jehovah at gilʹgal
34  samuel now went to raʹmah and saul went up to his own house at gibʹeah of saul
35  samuel did not see saul again until the day of his death for samuel went into mourning for saul
and jehovah regretted that he had made saul king over israel
20  then david ran away from naiʹoth in raʹmah
however he came to jonʹathan and said what have i done what is my offense and how have i sinned against your father for him to seek my life
2  at this jonʹathan said to him it is unthinkable you will not die
look my father will not do anything great or small without disclosing it to me
why should my father hide this matter from me this will not happen
3  but david swore further and said your father surely knows that i have found favor in your eyes and would say do not let jonʹathan know this or he will be upset
but as surely as jehovah is living and as surely as you are living there is only a step between me and death
4  then jonʹathan said to david whatever you say i will do for you
5  david said to jonʹathan tomorrow is the new moon and i am certainly expected to sit with the king to eat you must send me away and i will hide in the field until the evening on the third day
6  if your father misses me at all then say david begged me for permission to go quickly to his city bethʹlehem because there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family
7  if his response is that is fine it means peace to your servant
but if he becomes angry you can be sure that he is determined to harm me
8  show loyal love to your servant for you have brought your servant into jehovahs covenant with you
but if i am guilty put me to death yourself
why turn me over to your father
9  to this jonʹathan said it is unthinkable to suggest that about you if i learn that my father is determined to harm you would i not tell you
10  then david said to jonʹathan who will tell me whether your father gives you a harsh answer
11  jonʹathan said to david come let us go out into the field
so both of them went out into the field
12  and jonʹathan said to david let jehovah the god of israel be a witness that i will sound out my father about this time tomorrow or by the third day
if he is favorably disposed toward david will i not then send you word and disclose it to you
13  but if my father intends to harm you may jehovah do that and more to jonʹathan if i do not disclose it to you and send you away in peace
may jehovah be with you just as he was with my father
14  and will you not show me the loyal love of jehovah while i am alive and even when i die
15  never withdraw your loyal love from my household even when jehovah wipes out all the enemies of david from the face of the earth
16  so jonʹathan made a covenant with the house of david saying jehovah will require it and call davids enemies to account
17  so jonʹathan had david swear again by his love for him for he loved him as he loved himself
18  jonʹathan then said to him tomorrow is the new moon and you will be missed for your seat will be vacant
19  by the third day you will be missed even more and you must go to the place where you hid the other day and stay near the stone here
20  i will then shoot three arrows to one side of it as though i were shooting at a target
21  when i send the attendant i will say go find the arrows
if i say to the attendant look the arrows are on this side of you get them then you may come back for as surely as jehovah is living it means everything is peaceful for you and there is no danger
22  but if i should say to the boy look the arrows are beyond you then go for jehovah has sent you away
23  as for the promise that we have made you and i may jehovah be between us forever
24  so david hid in the field
when the new moon came the king took his seat at the meal to eat
25  the king was sitting in his usual seat by the wall
jonʹathan was facing him and abʹner was sitting at sauls side but davids place was vacant
26  saul did not say anything that day for he said to himself something has happened so that he is not clean
yes he must be unclean
27  and the day after the new moon on the second day davids place continued vacant
saul then said to jonʹathan his son why has the son of jesʹse not come to the meal either yesterday or today
28  jonʹathan answered saul david begged me for permission to go to bethʹlehem
29  he said please permit me to go because we have a family sacrifice in the city and my own brother summoned me
so if i have found favor in your eyes please let me slip away to see my brothers
that is why he has not come to the kings table
30  then saul became enraged with jonʹathan and he said to him you son of a rebellious woman do you think i do not know that you are choosing to side with the son of jesʹse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother
31  as long as the son of jesʹse is alive on the earth you and your kingship will not be firmly established
so now send someone to bring him to me for he must die
32  however jonʹathan said to saul his father why should he be put to death what has he done
33  at that saul hurled the spear at him to strike him so jonʹathan knew that his father was determined to put david to death
34  jonʹathan immediately rose up from the table in the heat of anger and he did not eat any food on the second day after the new moon for he was upset over david and his own father had humiliated him
35  in the morning jonʹathan went out to the field for the appointment with david and a young attendant was with him
36  and he said to his attendant please run and find the arrows that i shoot
the attendant ran and jonʹathan shot the arrow beyond him
37  when the attendant reached the place where jonʹathan had shot the arrow jonʹathan called out to the attendant is not the arrow beyond you
38  jonʹathan called out to the attendant hurry go quickly do not delay and jonʹathans attendant picked up the arrows and came back to his master
39  the attendant did not understand anything about the matter only jonʹathan and david knew what was meant
40  then jonʹathan gave his weapons to his attendant and told him go take them to the city
41  when the attendant left david rose up from a place nearby that was to the south
then he fell with his face to the ground and bowed three times and they kissed each other and wept for each other but david wept the most
42  jonʹathan said to david go in peace since we have both sworn in the name of jehovah saying may jehovah be between you and me and between your offspring and my offspring forever
then david rose up and left and jonʹathan went back to the city
1  now there was a man of ramathaʹimzoʹphim of the mountainous region of eʹphraim whose name was elkaʹnah the son of jeroʹham the son of eliʹhu the son of toʹhu the son of zuph an eʹphraimite
2  he had two wives one was named hanʹnah and the other was named peninʹnah
peninʹnah had children but hanʹnah had no children
3  that man went up from his city year after year to worship and to sacrifice to jehovah of armies in shiʹloh
that is where the two sons of eʹli hophʹni and phinʹehas served as priests to jehovah
4  one day when elkaʹnah offered a sacrifice he gave portions to his wife peninʹnah as well as to all her sons and her daughters
5  but to hanʹnah he gave a special portion because hanʹnah was the one he loved but jehovah had not given her children
6  moreover her rival wife taunted her relentlessly in order to upset her because jehovah had not given her children
7  that is what she would do year after year whenever hanʹnah went up to the house of jehovah her rival would taunt her so much that she would weep and not eat
8  but her husband elkaʹnah said to her hanʹnah why do you weep and why do you not eat and why are you so sad am i not better to you than ten sons
9  then hanʹnah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in shiʹloh
at the time eʹli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of jehovah
10  hanʹnah was extremely bitter and she began to pray to jehovah and to weep uncontrollably
11  and she made this vow o jehovah of armies if you look upon the affliction of your servant and remember me and you do not forget your servant and give to your servant a male child i will give him to jehovah all the days of his life and no razor will touch his head
12  while she prayed for a long time before jehovah eʹli was watching her mouth
13  hanʹnah was speaking in her heart only her lips were trembling but her voice was not heard
so eʹli thought she was drunk
14  eʹli said to her how long will you stay drunk stop drinking your wine
15  at this hanʹnah answered no my lord i am a woman under great stress i have not drunk wine or anything alcoholic but i am pouring out my soul before jehovah
16  do not take your servant for a worthless woman for i have been speaking until now out of my great anguish and distress
17  then eʹli answered go in peace and may the god of israel grant your petition that you have asked of him
18  to this she said let your servant find favor in your eyes
and the woman went on her way and ate and her face was no longer downcast
19  then they got up early in the morning and bowed before jehovah after which they returned to their house in raʹmah
elkaʹnah had sexual relations with his wife hanʹnah and jehovah gave attention to her
20  within a year hanʹnah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and named him samuel because as she said it is from jehovah that i have asked him
21  in time elkaʹnah went up with all his household to offer the yearly sacrifice to jehovah and to present his vow offering
22  but hanʹnah did not go up for she said to her husband as soon as the boy is weaned i will bring him then he will appear before jehovah and remain there from then on
23  elkaʹnah her husband then said to her do what you think is best
stay at home until you wean him
may jehovah carry out what you have said
so the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she weaned him
24  as soon as she had weaned him she took him up to shiʹloh along with a threeyearold bull one eʹphah of flour and a large jar of wine and she came to the house of jehovah in shiʹloh and brought the young boy with her
25  then they slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to eʹli
26  with that she said pardon me my lord as surely as you live my lord i am the woman who was standing with you in this place to pray to jehovah
27  it was for this boy that i prayed and jehovah granted my petition that i asked of him
28  i in turn now lend him to jehovah
for all his days he is lent to jehovah
and he bowed down there to jehovah
2  then hanʹnah said in prayer my heart rejoices in jehovahmy horn is exalted by jehovah
my mouth is opened wide against my enemiesfor i rejoice in your acts of salvation
2  there is no one holy like jehovahthere is no one but youand there is no rock like our god
3  do not keep speaking with haughtinesslet nothing arrogant come from your mouthfor jehovah is a god of knowledgeand by him deeds are rightly evaluated
4  the bows of mighty men are shatteredbut those who are stumbling are given strength
5  the wellfed must hire themselves out for breadbut the hungry hunger no more
the barren has given birth to sevenbut she who had many sons has become desolate
6  jehovah kills and he preserves lifehe brings down to the grave and he raises up
7  jehovah impoverishes and he enricheshe abases and he exalts
8  he raises the lowly one from the dusthe lifts up the poor from the ash heapto make them sit with princesgiving them a seat of honor
to jehovah belong earths supportsand he places the productive land upon them
9  he guards the steps of his loyal onesbut the wicked will be silenced in darknessfor not by power does a man prevail
10  jehovah will shatter those fighting against himhe will thunder against them from the heavens
jehovah will judge to the ends of the earthhe will give power to his kingand exalt the horn of his anointed one
11  then elkaʹnah went to his house in raʹmah but the boy became a minister of jehovah before eʹli the priest
12  now the sons of eʹli were wicked men they had no regard for jehovah
13  this is what they did with the due right of the priests from the people whenever any man was offering a sacrifice an attendant of the priest came with a threepronged fork in his hand when the meat was boiling
14  and he would thrust it into the basin the twohandled cooking pot the cauldron or the onehandled cooking pot
whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself
that is what they would do in shiʹloh to all the israelites coming there
15  also even before the man sacrificing could make the fat smoke an attendant of the priest would come and say to him give the priest meat to roast
he will not take boiled meat from you only raw meat
16  when the man would say to him let them first be sure to make the fat smoke then take for yourself whatever you desire he would say no give it to me now if not i will take it by force
17  thus the sin of the attendants came to be very great before jehovah for the men treated the offering of jehovah with disrespect
18  now samuel was ministering before jehovah wearing a linen ephʹod though he was just a boy
19  also his mother would make for him a little sleeveless coat and she brought it up to him year after year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice
20  and eʹli blessed elkaʹnah and his wife and said may jehovah grant you a child from this wife in place of the one who was lent to jehovah
and they went back home
21  jehovah turned his attention to hanʹnah so that she could conceive and she gave birth to three more sons and two daughters
and the boy samuel continued growing up before jehovah
22  now eʹli was very old but he had heard about everything that his sons were doing to all israel and how they would lie down with the women who served at the entrance of the tent of meeting
23  he used to say to them why do you keep doing things like these for the things i am hearing about you from all the people are bad
24  no my sons the report that i hear circulating among the people of jehovah is not good
25  if a man should sin against another man someone may appeal to jehovah for him but if a man should sin against jehovah who can pray for him but they refused to listen to their father for jehovah had determined to put them to death
26  meanwhile the boy samuel kept growing in stature and in favor both with jehovah and with the people
27  a man of god came to eʹli and said to him this is what jehovah says did i not plainly reveal myself to your fathers house while they were in egypt as slaves to the house of pharʹaoh
28  and he was chosen out of all the tribes of israel to serve as my priest and to go up on my altar to make sacrifices to offer incense and to bear an ephʹod before me and i gave to the house of your forefather all the offerings made by fire of the israelites
29  why do you men scorn my sacrifice and my offering that i have commanded in my place of dwelling why do you keep honoring your sons more than me by fattening yourselves from the best portions of every offering of my people israel
30  that is why the word of jehovah the god of israel is i did indeed say that your house and the house of your forefather would always walk before me
but now jehovah declares it is unthinkable on my part because those honoring me i will honor but those despising me will be treated with contempt
31  look days are coming when i will cut off your strength and that of your fathers house so that no man in your house will live to old age
32  and you will look upon a rival in my dwelling amid all the good that is done to israel and never again will there be an old man in your house
33  the man of yours whom i do not cut off from serving at my altar will cause your eyes to fail and will bring you grief but the greater number of your house will die by the sword of men
34  and what happens to your two sons hophʹni and phinʹehas will be the sign for you on one day both of them will die
35  then i will raise up for myself a faithful priest
he will act in harmony with what is my hearts desire and i will build for him a lasting house and he will walk before my anointed one always
36  anyone who remains in your house will come and bow down to him for the payment of money and a loaf of bread and will say assign me please to one of the priestly offices to eat a piece of bread
3  meanwhile the boy samuel was ministering to jehovah before eʹli but word from jehovah had become rare in those days visions were not widespread
2  one day eʹli was lying down in his usual place and his eyes had grown dim he was not able to see
3  the lamp of god had not yet been extinguished and samuel was lying in the temple of jehovah where the ark of god was
4  jehovah then called samuel
he answered here i am
5  he ran to eʹli and said here i am for you called me
but he said i did not call
lie down again
so he went and lay down
6  jehovah called once again samuel at this samuel got up and went to eʹli and said here i am for you called me
but he said i did not call my son
lie down again
7  now samuel had not yet come to know jehovah and the word of jehovah had not yet been revealed to him
8  so jehovah called again a third time samuel at that he got up and went to eʹli and said here i am for you called me
eʹli then realized that it was jehovah who was calling the boy
9  so eʹli said to samuel go lie down and if he calls you you should say speak jehovah for your servant is listening
and samuel went and lay down in his place
10  jehovah came and stood there and he called as at the other times samuel samuel at this samuel said speak for your servant is listening
11  jehovah said to samuel look i am doing something in israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears about it tingle
12  on that day i will carry out toward eʹli all that i said about his house from start to finish
13  you must tell him that i am bringing a lasting judgment on his house for the error that he has known about for his sons are cursing god but he has not rebuked them
14  that is why i have sworn to the house of eʹli that the error of the house of eʹli will never be atoned for by sacrifices or by offerings
15  samuel lay down until the morning then he opened the doors of jehovahs house
samuel was afraid to tell eʹli of the vision
16  but eʹli called for samuel samuel my son at this he said here i am
17  he asked what message did he speak to you please do not hide it from me
may god do so to you and add to it if you hide from me a single word of all that he said to you
18  so samuel told him everything and he did not hide anything from him
eʹli said it is jehovah
let him do what is good in his eyes
19  samuel continued growing up and jehovah himself was with him and did not let any of all his words go unfulfilled
20  all israel from dan to beʹersheʹba became aware that samuel had been confirmed as jehovahs prophet
21  and jehovah continued to appear in shiʹloh for jehovah revealed himself to samuel in shiʹloh by the word of jehovah
12  finally samuel said to all israel here i have done all that you asked of me and i appointed a king to reign over you
2  now here is the king who is leading you as for me i have grown old and gray and my sons are here with you and i have led you from my youth until this day
3  here i am
testify against me before jehovah and before his anointed one whose bull or whose donkey have i taken or whom have i defrauded or crushed from whose hand have i accepted a bribe to make me look the other way if i have i will restore it to you
4  to this they said you have not defrauded us or crushed us or accepted anything at all from anyones hand
5  so he said to them jehovah is a witness against you and his anointed one is a witness this day that you have found nothing to accuse me of
to this they said he is a witness
6  so samuel said to the people jehovah who used moses and aaron and who brought your forefathers up out of the land of egypt is a witness
7  and now take your positions and i will judge you before jehovah in view of all the righteous acts that jehovah has done for you and for your forefathers
8  as soon as jacob had come into egypt and your forefathers began calling to jehovah for help jehovah sent moses and aaron to lead your forefathers out of egypt and to cause them to dwell in this place
9  but they forgot jehovah their god and he sold them into the hand of sisʹera the chief of the army of haʹzor and into the hand of the philisʹtines and into the hand of the king of moʹab and they fought against them
10  and they called to jehovah for help and said we have sinned for we have left jehovah to serve the baʹals and the ashʹtoreth images now rescue us out of the hand of our enemies so that we may serve you
11  then jehovah sent jerubbaʹal and beʹdan and jephʹthah and samuel and rescued you from the hand of the enemies all around you so that you could live in security
12  when you saw that naʹhash the king of the amʹmonites had come against you you kept saying to me no we are determined to have a king over us even though jehovah your god is your king
13  now here is the king whom you have chosen the one you asked for
look jehovah has appointed a king over you
14  if you fear jehovah and serve him and obey his voice and you do not rebel against the order of jehovah and both you and the king who reigns over you follow jehovah your god fine
15  but if you do not obey the voice of jehovah and you rebel against the order of jehovah the hand of jehovah will be against you and your fathers
16  now take your positions and see this great thing that jehovah is doing before your eyes
17  is it not the wheat harvest today i will call on jehovah to make it thunder and rain then know and understand what an evil thing you have done in the eyes of jehovah in asking for a king for yourselves
18  at that samuel called to jehovah and jehovah made it thunder and rain on that day so that all the people were greatly in fear of jehovah and of samuel
19  and all the people said to samuel pray to jehovah your god for your servants as we do not want to die for we have added to all our sins another evil by asking for a king
20  so samuel said to the people do not be afraid
you have indeed done all this evil
only do not turn away from following jehovah and serve jehovah with all your heart
21  do not turn away to follow the empty things which are of no benefit and cannot rescue because they are empty
22  for the sake of his great name jehovah will not abandon his people for jehovah has taken it upon himself to make you his people
23  as for me it is unthinkable for me to sin against jehovah by ceasing to pray in your behalf and i will continue to instruct you in the good and right way
24  only fear jehovah and serve him faithfully with all your heart for see what great things he has done for you
25  but if you flagrantly do what is bad you will be swept away both you and your king
