10  so he summoned his 12 disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits in order to expel these and to cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity
2  the names of the 12 apostles are these first simon the one called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebʹedee and john his brother
3  philip and bartholʹomew thomas and matthew the tax collector james the son of alphaeʹus thaddaeʹus
4  simon the cananaeʹan and judas iscarʹiot who later betrayed him
5  these 12 jesus sent out giving them these instructions do not go off into the road of the nations and do not enter any samarʹitan city
6  but instead go continually to the lost sheep of the house of israel
7  as you go preach saying the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
8  cure the sick raise up the dead make lepers clean expel demons
you received free give free
9  do not acquire gold or silver or copper for your money belts
10  or a food pouch for the trip or two garments or sandals or a staff for the worker deserves his food
11  into whatever city or village you enter search out who in it is deserving and stay there until you leave
12  when you enter the house greet the household
13  if the house is deserving let the peace you wish it come upon it but if it is not deserving let the peace from you return upon you
14  wherever anyone does not receive you or listen to your words on going out of that house or that city shake the dust off your feet
15  truly i say to you it will be more endurable for the land of sodʹom and gomorʹrah on judgment day than for that city
16  look i am sending you out as sheep among wolves so prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves
17  be on your guard against men for they will hand you over to local courts and they will scourge you in their synagogues
18  and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a witness to them and the nations
19  however when they hand you over do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour
20  for the ones speaking are not just you but it is the spirit of your father that speaks by you
21  further brother will hand brother over to death and a father his child and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death
22  and you will be hated by all people on account of my name but the one who has endured to the end will be saved
23  when they persecute you in one city flee to another for truly i say to you you will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of israel until the son of man arrives
24  a student is not above his teacher nor a slave above his master
25  it is enough for the student to become as his teacher and the slave as his master
if people have called the master of the house beelʹzebub how much more those of his household
26  so do not fear them for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known
27  what i tell you in the darkness say in the light and what you hear whispered preach from the housetops
28  and do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in gehenʹna
29  two sparrows sell for a coin of small value do they not yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your fathers knowledge
30  but even the hairs of your head are all numbered
31  so have no fear you are worth more than many sparrows
32  everyone then who acknowledges me before men i will also acknowledge him before my father who is in the heavens
33  but whoever disowns me before men i will also disown him before my father who is in the heavens
34  do not think i came to bring peace to the earth i came to bring not peace but a sword
35  for i came to cause division with a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw
36  indeed a mans enemies will be those of his own household
37  whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me and whoever has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me
38  and whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me
39  whoever finds his soul will lose it and whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it
40  whoever receives you receives me also and whoever receives me receives also the one who sent me
41  whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophets reward and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will get a righteous mans reward
42  and whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple i tell you truly he will by no means lose his reward
4  then jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
2  after he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights he felt hungry
3  and the tempter approached and said to him if you are a son of god tell these stones to become loaves of bread
4  but he answered it is written man must live not on bread alone but on every word that comes from jehovahs mouth
5  then the devil took him along into the holy city and he stationed him on the battlement of the temple
6  and said to him if you are a son of god throw yourself down for it is written he will give his angels a command concerning you and they will carry you on their hands so that you may not strike your foot against a stone
7  jesus said to him again it is written you must not put jehovah your god to the test
8  again the devil took him along to an unusually high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory
9  and he said to him all these things i will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me
10  then jesus said to him go away satan for it is written it is jehovah your god you must worship and it is to him alone you must render sacred service
11  then the devil left him and look angels came and began to minister to him
12  now when he heard that john had been arrested he withdrew into galʹilee
13  further after leaving nazʹareth he came and took up residence in caperʹnaum beside the sea in the districts of zebʹulun and naphʹtali
14  so as to fulfill what was spoken through isaiah the prophet who said
15  o land of zebʹulun and land of naphʹtali along the road of the sea on the other side of the jordan galʹilee of the nations
16  the people sitting in darkness saw a great light and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow light rose on them
17  from that time on jesus began preaching and saying repent for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
18  walking alongside the sea of galʹilee he saw two brothers simon who is called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
19  and he said to them come after me and i will make you fishers of men
20  at once they abandoned their nets and followed him
21  going on from there he saw two others who were brothers james the son of zebʹedee and his brother john
they were in the boat with zebʹedee their father mending their nets and he called them
22  at once they left the boat and their father and followed him
23  then he went throughout the whole of galʹilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people
24  and the report about him spread throughout all syria and they brought him all those who were suffering with various diseases and torments those who were demonpossessed and epileptic and paralyzed and he cured them
25  consequently large crowds followed him from galʹilee and decapʹolis and jerusalem and judeʹa and from the other side of the jordan
26  now when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples
2  you know that two days from now the passover takes place and the son of man will be handed over to be executed on the stake
3  then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest who was named caʹiaphas
4  and they conspired together to seize jesus by cunning and to kill him
5  however they were saying not at the festival so that there may not be an uproar among the people
6  while jesus was in bethʹany in the house of simon the leper
7  a woman with an alabaster jar of costly perfumed oil approached him and she began pouring it on his head as he was dining
8  on seeing this the disciples became indignant and said why this waste
9  for this could have been sold for a great deal of money and given to the poor
10  aware of this jesus said to them why do you try to make trouble for the woman she did a fine deed toward me
11  for you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me
12  when she put this perfumed oil on my body she did it to prepare me for burial
13  truly i say to you wherever this good news is preached in all the world what this woman did will also be told in memory of her
14  then one of the twelve the one called judas iscarʹiot went to the chief priests
15  and said what will you give me to betray him to you they stipulated to him 30 silver pieces
16  so from then on he kept looking for a good opportunity to betray him
17  on the first day of the unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the passover
18  he said go into the city to soandso and say to him the teacher says my appointed time is near i will celebrate the passover with my disciples at your home
19  so the disciples did as jesus instructed them and prepared for the passover
20  when evening came he was reclining at the table with the 12 disciples
21  while they were eating he said truly i say to you one of you will betray me
22  being very much grieved at this each and every one began to say to him lord it is not i is it
23  in reply he said the one who dips his hand with me into the bowl is the one who will betray me
24  true the son of man is going away just as it is written about him but woe to that man through whom the son of man is betrayed it would have been better for that man if he had not been born
25  judas who was about to betray him replied it is not i is it rabbi jesus said to him you yourself said it
26  as they continued eating jesus took a loaf and after saying a blessing he broke it and giving it to the disciples he said take eat
this means my body
27  and taking a cup he offered thanks and gave it to them saying drink out of it all of you
28  for this means my blood of the covenant which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins
29  but i say to you i will by no means drink again any of this product of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in the kingdom of my father
30  finally after singing praises they went out to the mount of olives
31  then jesus said to them all of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about
32  but after i have been raised up i will go ahead of you into galʹilee
33  but peter in response said to him although all the others are stumbled in connection with you i will never be stumbled
34  jesus said to him truly i say to you on this night before a rooster crows you will disown me three times
35  peter said to him even if i should have to die with you i will by no means disown you
all the other disciples also said the same thing
36  then jesus came with them to the spot called gethsemʹane and he said to the disciples sit down here while i go over there and pray
37  and taking along peter and the two sons of zebʹedee he began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled
38  then he said to them i am deeply grieved even to death
stay here and keep on the watch with me
39  and going a little way forward he fell facedown praying my father if it is possible let this cup pass away from me
yet not as i will but as you will
40  he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping and he said to peter could you not so much as keep on the watch for one hour with me
41  keep on the watch and pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation
the spirit of course is eager but the flesh is weak
42  again a second time he went off and prayed my father if it is not possible for this to pass away unless i drink it let your will take place
43  and he came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy
44  so leaving them he again went off and prayed for a third time saying once more the same thing
45  then he returned to the disciples and said to them at such a time as this you are sleeping and resting look the hour has drawn near for the son of man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners
46  get up let us go
look my betrayer has drawn near
47  while he was still speaking look judas one of the twelve came and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people
48  now his betrayer had given them a sign saying whoever it is i kiss he is the one take him into custody
49  and going straight up to jesus he said greetings rabbi and gave him a tender kiss
50  but jesus said to him fellow for what purpose are you present then they came forward and seized jesus and took him into custody
51  but look one of those with jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest taking off his ear
52  then jesus said to him return your sword to its place for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword
53  or do you think that i cannot appeal to my father to supply me at this moment more than 12 legions of angels
54  in that case how would the scriptures be fulfilled that say it must take place this way
55  in that hour jesus said to the crowds did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber day after day i used to sit in the temple teaching and yet you did not take me into custody
56  but all of this has taken place for the writings of the prophets to be fulfilled
then all the disciples abandoned him and fled
57  those who took jesus into custody led him away to caʹiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were gathered together
58  but peter kept following him from a good distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and after going inside he sat with the house attendants to see the outcome
59  now the chief priests and the entire sanʹhedrin were looking for false testimony against jesus in order to put him to death
60  but they found none although many false witnesses came forward
later two came forward
61  and said this man said i am able to throw down the temple of god and build it up in three days
62  with that the high priest stood up and said to him do you say nothing in reply what is it these men are testifying against you
63  but jesus kept silent
so the high priest said to him i put you under oath by the living god to tell us whether you are the christ the son of god
64  jesus said to him you yourself said it
but i say to you from now on you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven
65  then the high priest ripped his outer garments saying he has blasphemed what further need do we have of witnesses see now you have heard the blasphemy
66  what is your opinion they answered he deserves to die
67  then they spat in his face and hit him with their fists
others slapped him on the face
68  saying prophesy to us you christ
who struck you
69  now peter was sitting outside in the courtyard and a servant girl came up to him and said you too were with jesus the galileʹan
70  but he denied it before them all saying i do not know what you are talking about
71  when he went out to the gatehouse another girl noticed him and said to those there this man was with jesus the nazareneʹ
72  again he denied it with an oath i do not know the man
73  after a little while those standing around came up and said to peter certainly you are also one of them for in fact your dialect gives you away
74  then he started to curse and swear i do not know the man and immediately a rooster crowed
75  and peter called to mind what jesus had said namely before a rooster crows you will disown me three times
and he went outside and wept bitterly
11  when jesus had finished giving instructions to his 12 disciples he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities
2  but john having heard in jail about the works of the christ sent his disciples
3  to ask him are you the coming one or are we to expect a different one
4  in reply jesus said to them go and report to john what you are hearing and seeing
5  the blind are now seeing and the lame are walking the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing the dead are being raised up and the poor are being told the good news
6  happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me
7  while these were on their way jesus began to speak to the crowds about john what did you go out into the wilderness to see a reed being tossed by the wind
8  what then did you go out to see a man dressed in soft garments why those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings
9  really then why did you go out to see a prophet yes i tell you and far more than a prophet
10  this is the one about whom it is written look i am sending my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way ahead of you
11  truly i say to you among those born of women there has not been raised up anyone greater than john the baptist but a lesser person in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is
12  from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press and those pressing forward are seizing it
13  for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john
14  and if you are willing to accept it he is eliʹjah who is to come
15  let the one who has ears listen
16  with whom will i compare this generation it is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to their playmates
17  saying we played the flute for you but you did not dance we wailed but you did not beat yourselves in grief
18  likewise john came neither eating nor drinking but people say he has a demon
19  the son of man did come eating and drinking but people say look a man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine a friend of tax collectors and sinners
all the same wisdom is proved righteous by its works
20  then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his powerful works had taken place for they did not repent
21  woe to you choraʹzin woe to you bethsaʹida because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in tyre and siʹdon they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes
22  but i say to you it will be more endurable for tyre and siʹdon on judgment day than for you
23  and you caperʹnaum will you perhaps be exalted to heaven down to the grave you will come because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in sodʹom it would have remained until this very day
24  but i say to you it will be more endurable for the land of sodʹom on judgment day than for you
25  at that time jesus said in response i publicly praise you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children
26  yes o father because this is the way you approved
27  all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one fully knows the son except the father neither does anyone fully know the father except the son and anyone to whom the son is willing to reveal him
28  come to me all you who are toiling and loaded down and i will refresh you
29  take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am mildtempered and lowly in heart and you will find refreshment for yourselves
30  for my yoke is kindly and my load is light
8  after he came down from the mountain large crowds followed him
2  and look a leper came up and did obeisance to him saying lord if you just want to you can make me clean
3  so stretching out his hand he touched him saying i want to be made clean
immediately his leprosy was cleansed away
4  then jesus said to him see that you tell no one but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that moses appointed for a witness to them
5  when he entered caperʹnaum an army officer came to him pleading with him
6  and saying sir my servant is laid up in the house with paralysis and he is suffering terribly
7  he said to him when i get there i will cure him
8  the army officer replied sir i am not worthy to have you come under my roof but just say the word and my servant will be healed
9  for i too am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my slave do this and he does it
10  when jesus heard that he was amazed and said to those following him i tell you the truth with no one in israel have i found so great a faith
11  but i tell you that many from east and west will come and recline at the table with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of the heavens
12  whereas the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside
there is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be
13  then jesus said to the army officer go
just as you have shown faith so let it come to pass for you
and the servant was healed in that hour
14  and jesus on coming into peters house saw his motherinlaw lying down and sick with fever
15  so he touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began ministering to him
16  but after it became evening people brought him many demonpossessed ones and he expelled the spirits with a word and he cured all who were suffering
17  in order to fulfill what was spoken through isaiah the prophet he himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases
18  when jesus saw a crowd around him he gave the command to depart for the other side
19  and a scribe came up and said to him teacher i will follow you wherever you go
20  but jesus said to him foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay down his head
21  then another of the disciples said to him lord permit me first to go and bury my father
22  jesus said to him keep following me and let the dead bury their dead
23  and when he went aboard a boat his disciples followed him
24  now look a great storm arose on the sea so that the boat was being covered by the waves but he was sleeping
25  and they came and woke him up saying lord save us we are about to perish
26  but he said to them why are you so afraid you with little faith then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and a great calm set in
27  so the men were amazed and said what sort of person is this even the winds and the sea obey him
28  when he came to the other side into the region of the gadarenesʹ two demonpossessed men coming out from among the tombs met him
they were unusually fierce so nobody had the courage to pass by on that road
29  and look they screamed saying what have we to do with you son of god did you come here to torment us before the appointed time
30  a long way off from them a herd of many swine was feeding
31  so the demons began to plead with him saying if you expel us send us into the herd of swine
32  and he said to them go with that they came out and went off into the swine and look the entire herd rushed over the precipice into the sea and died in the waters
33  but the herders fled and going into the city they reported everything including the account of the demonpossessed men
34  and look all the city turned out to meet jesus and when they saw him they urged him to depart from their region
16  here the pharisees and sadducees approached him and to test him they asked him to display to them a sign from heaven
2  in reply he said to them when evening falls you say it will be fair weather for the sky is firered
3  and in the morning it will be wintry rainy weather today for the sky is firered but gloomy
you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but the signs of the times you cannot interpret
4  a wicked and adulterous generation keeps seeking a sign but no sign will be given it except the sign of joʹnah
with that he went away leaving them behind
5  now the disciples crossed to the other side and forgot to take bread along
6  jesus said to them keep your eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees
7  so they began to reason among themselves saying we did not take any loaves along
8  knowing this jesus said why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no loaves you with little faith
9  do you not yet see the point or do you not remember the five loaves in the case of the 5000 and how many baskets you took up
10  or the seven loaves in the case of the 4000 and how many large baskets you took up
11  how is it you do not discern that i did not speak to you about bread but watch out for the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees
12  then they grasped that he said to watch out not for the leaven of bread but for the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees
13  when he had come into the region of caesareʹa philipʹpi jesus asked his disciples who are men saying the son of man is
14  they said some say john the baptist others eliʹjah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets
15  he said to them you though who do you say i am
16  simon peter answered you are the christ the son of the living god
17  in response jesus said to him happy you are simon son of joʹnah because flesh and blood did not reveal it to you but my father in the heavens did
18  also i say to you you are peter and on this rock i will build my congregation and the gates of the grave will not overpower it
19  i will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens and whatever you may bind on earth will already be bound in the heavens and whatever you may loosen on earth will already be loosened in the heavens
20  then he sternly instructed the disciples not to tell anybody that he was the christ
21  from that time forward jesus began explaining to his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised up
22  at this peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying be kind to yourself lord you will not have this happen to you at all
23  but turning his back he said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me because you think not gods thoughts but those of men
24  then jesus said to his disciples if anyone wants to come after me let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me
25  for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
26  really what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his life or what will a man give in exchange for his life
27  for the son of man is to come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he will repay each one according to his behavior
28  truly i say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
18  in that hour the disciples came near to jesus and said who really is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens
2  so calling a young child to him he stood him in their midst
3  and said truly i say to you unless you turn around and become as young children you will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens
4  therefore whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one who is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens
5  and whoever receives one such young child on the basis of my name receives me also
6  but whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith in me it would be better for him to have hung around his neck a millstone that is turned by a donkey and to be sunk in the open sea
7  woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks of course it is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes
8  if then your hand or your foot makes you stumble cut it off and throw it away from you
it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown with two hands or two feet into the everlasting fire
9  also if your eye makes you stumble tear it out and throw it away from you
it is better for you to enter oneeyed into life than to be thrown with two eyes into the fiery gehenʹna
10  see that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my father who is in heaven
11  
12  what do you think if a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays will he not leave the 99 on the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying
13  and if he finds it i certainly tell you he rejoices more over it than over the 99 that have not strayed
14  likewise it is not a desirable thing to my father who is in heaven for even one of these little ones to perish
15  moreover if your brother commits a sin go and reveal his fault between you and him alone
if he listens to you you have gained your brother
16  but if he does not listen take along with you one or two more so that on the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established
17  if he does not listen to them speak to the congregation
if he does not listen even to the congregation let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector
18  truly i say to you whatever things you may bind on earth will be things already bound in heaven and whatever things you may loosen on earth will be things already loosened in heaven
19  again i tell you truly if two of you on earth agree concerning anything of importance that they should request it will take place for them on account of my father in heaven
20  for where there are two or three gathered together in my name there i am in their midst
21  then peter came and said to him lord how many times is my brother to sin against me and am i to forgive him up to seven times
22  jesus said to him i say to you not up to seven times but up to 77 times
23  that is why the kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves
24  when he started to settle them a man was brought in who owed him 10000 talents
25  but because he did not have the means to pay it back his master ordered him and his wife and his children and all the things he owned to be sold and payment to be made
26  so the slave fell down and did obeisance to him saying be patient with me and i will pay back everything to you
27  moved with pity at this the master of that slave let him off and canceled his debt
28  but that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him 100 denarʹii and grabbed him and began to choke him saying pay back whatever you owe
29  so his fellow slave fell down and began to beg him saying be patient with me and i will pay you back
30  however he was not willing but he went and had him thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed
31  when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they became greatly distressed and they went and reported to their master all the things that had happened
32  then his master summoned him and said to him wicked slave i canceled all that debt for you when you pleaded with me
33  should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as i showed mercy to you
34  with that his master provoked to wrath handed him over to the jailers until he repaid all that he owed
35  my heavenly father will also deal with you in the same way if each of you does not forgive your brother from your heart
17  six days later jesus took peter and james and his brother john along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves
2  and he was transfigured before them his face shone as the sun and his outer garments became brilliant as the light
3  and look there appeared to them moses and eliʹjah conversing with him
4  then peter said to jesus lord it is fine for us to be here
if you wish i will erect three tents here one for you one for moses and one for eliʹjah
5  while he was still speaking look a bright cloud overshadowed them and look a voice out of the cloud said this is my son the beloved whom i have approved
listen to him
6  at hearing this the disciples fell facedown and became very much afraid
7  then jesus came near and touching them he said get up
have no fear
8  when they looked up they saw no one but jesus himself
9  as they were descending from the mountain jesus commanded them tell the vision to no one until the son of man is raised up from the dead
10  however the disciples put the question to him why then do the scribes say that eliʹjah must come first
11  in reply he said eliʹjah is indeed coming and will restore all things
12  however i say to you that eliʹjah has already come and they did not recognize him but did whatever they wanted with him
in this way also the son of man is going to suffer at their hands
13  then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about john the baptist
14  when they came toward the crowd a man approached him knelt down to him and said
15  lord have mercy on my son because he is an epileptic and is ill
he falls often into the fire and often into the water
16  i brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him
17  in reply jesus said o faithless and twisted generation how long must i continue with you how long must i put up with you bring him here to me
18  then jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was cured from that hour
19  then the disciples came to jesus privately and said why could we not expel it
20  he said to them because of your little faith
for truly i say to you if you have faith the size of a mustard grain you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you
21  
22  it was while they were gathered together in galʹilee that jesus said to them the son of man is going to be betrayed into mens hands
23  and they will kill him and on the third day he will be raised up
and they were very much grieved
24  after they arrived in caperʹnaum the men collecting the two drachmas tax approached peter and said does your teacher not pay the two drachmas tax
25  he said yes
however when he entered the house jesus spoke to him first and said what do you think simon from whom do the kings of the earth receive duties or head tax from their sons or from the strangers
26  when he said from the strangers jesus said to him really then the sons are taxfree
27  but that we do not cause them to stumble go to the sea cast a fishhook and take the first fish that comes up and when you open its mouth you will find a silver coin
take that and give it to them for me and you
9  so boarding the boat he traveled across and went into his own city
2  and look they were bringing him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher
on seeing their faith jesus said to the paralytic take courage child your sins are forgiven
3  now certain scribes said to themselves this fellow is blaspheming
4  jesus knowing their thoughts said why are you thinking wicked things in your hearts
5  for instance which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or to say get up and walk
6  however in order for you to know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins then he said to the paralytic get up pick up your stretcher and go to your home
7  and he got up and went to his home
8  when the crowds saw this they were struck with fear and they glorified god who gave such authority to men
9  next while moving on from there jesus caught sight of a man named matthew sitting at the tax office and he said to him be my follower
at that he rose up and followed him
10  later as he was dining in the house look many tax collectors and sinners came and began dining with jesus and his disciples
11  but on seeing this the pharisees said to his disciples why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
12  hearing them he said healthy people do not need a physician but those who are ill do
13  go then and learn what this means i want mercy and not sacrifice
for i came to call not righteous people but sinners
14  then johns disciples came to him and asked why do we and the pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not fast
15  at this jesus said to them the friends of the bridegroom have no reason to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them do they but days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and then they will fast
16  nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old outer garment for the new piece pulls away from the garment and the tear becomes worse
17  nor do people put new wine into old wineskins
if they do then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined
but people put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved
18  while he was telling them these things look a certain ruler who had approached did obeisance to him saying by now my daughter must be dead but come and lay your hand on her and she will come to life
19  then jesus got up and with his disciples followed him
20  and look a woman suffering for 12 years from a flow of blood approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment
21  for she kept saying to herself if i only touch his outer garment i will get well
22  jesus turned around and noticing her said take courage daughter your faith has made you well
and from that hour the woman was made well
23  when now he came into the rulers house and caught sight of the flute players and the crowd making a commotion
24  jesus said leave the place for the little girl did not die but is sleeping
at this they began to laugh at him scornfully
25  as soon as the crowd had been sent outside he went in and took hold of her hand and the little girl got up
26  of course the talk about this spread into all that region
27  as jesus moved on from there two blind men followed him shouting out have mercy on us son of david
28  after he had gone into the house the blind men came to him and jesus asked them do you have faith that i can do this they answered him yes lord
29  then he touched their eyes saying according to your faith let it happen to you
30  and their eyes received sight
moreover jesus sternly warned them saying see that nobody gets to know it
31  but after going outside they made it public about him in all that region
32  when they were leaving look people brought him a speechless man possessed of a demon
33  and after the demon had been expelled the speechless man spoke
well the crowds were amazed and said never has anything like this been seen in israel
34  but the pharisees were saying it is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons
35  and jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity
36  on seeing the crowds he felt pity for them because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd
37  then he said to his disciples yes the harvest is great but the workers are few
38  therefore beg the master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest
28  after the sabbath when it was growing light on the first day of the week mary magʹdalene and the other mary came to view the grave
2  and look a great earthquake had taken place for jehovahs angel had descended from heaven and had come and rolled away the stone and he was sitting on it
3  his appearance was like lightning and his clothing was as white as snow
4  yes out of their fear of him the watchmen trembled and became as dead men
5  but the angel said to the women do not be afraid for i know that you are looking for jesus who was executed on the stake
6  he is not here for he was raised up just as he said
come see the place where he was lying
7  then go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised up from the dead for look he is going ahead of you into galʹilee
you will see him there
look i have told you
8  so quickly leaving the memorial tomb with fear and great joy they ran to report to his disciples
9  and look jesus met them and said good day they approached and took hold of his feet and did obeisance to him
10  then jesus said to them have no fear go report to my brothers so that they may go to galʹilee and there they will see me
11  while they were on their way some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened
12  and after these had gathered with the elders and had consulted together they gave a considerable number of silver pieces to the soldiers
13  and said say his disciples came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping
14  and if this gets to the governors ears we will explain the matter to him and you will not need to worry
15  so they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed and this story has been spread abroad among the jews up to this very day
16  however the 11 disciples went to galʹilee to the mountain where jesus had arranged for them to meet
17  when they saw him they did obeisance but some doubted
18  jesus approached and spoke to them saying all authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth
19  go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
20  teaching them to observe all the things i have commanded you
and look i am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things
27  when morning came all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against jesus to put him to death
2  after binding him they led him off and handed him over to pilate the governor
3  then judas his betrayer seeing that jesus had been condemned felt remorse and brought the 30 pieces of silver back to the chief priests and elders
4  saying i sinned when i betrayed innocent blood
they said what is that to us you must see to it
5  so he threw the silver pieces into the temple and departed
then he went off and hanged himself
6  but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful to put them into the sacred treasury because they are the price of blood
7  after consulting together they used the money to buy the potters field as a burial place for strangers
8  therefore that field has been called field of blood to this very day
9  then what was spoken through jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled and they took the 30 silver pieces the price that was set on the man the one on whom a price was set by some of the sons of israel
10  and they gave them for the potters field according to what jehovah had commanded me
11  jesus now stood before the governor and the governor put the question to him are you the king of the jews jesus replied you yourself say it
12  but while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders he made no answer
13  then pilate said to him do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you
14  but he did not answer him no not a word so that the governor was very surprised
15  now from festival to festival it was the custom of the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd whomever they wanted
16  just at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called barabʹbas
17  so when they were gathered together pilate said to them which one do you want me to release to you barabʹbas or jesus the socalled christ
18  for pilate was aware that out of envy they had handed him over
19  moreover while he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent a message to him saying have nothing to do with that righteous man for i suffered a lot today in a dream because of him
20  but the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for barabʹbas but to have jesus put to death
21  in response the governor said to them which of the two do you want me to release to you they said barabʹbas
22  pilate said to them what then should i do with jesus the socalled christ they all said to the stake with him
23  he said why what bad thing did he do still they kept shouting out all the more to the stake with him
24  seeing that it did no good but rather an uproar was arising pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd saying i am innocent of the blood of this man
you yourselves must see to it
25  at that all the people said in answer let his blood come upon us and upon our children
26  then he released barabʹbas to them but he had jesus whipped and handed him over to be executed on the stake
27  then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the governors residence and gathered the whole body of troops together around him
28  and disrobing him they draped him with a scarlet cloak
29  and they braided a crown out of thorns and put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand
and kneeling before him they mocked him saying greetings you king of the jews
30  and they spat on him and took the reed and began hitting him on his head
31  finally after they had mocked him they stripped him of the cloak and put his outer garments on him and led him off to be nailed to the stake
32  as they were going out they found a man of cyreʹne named simon
this man they compelled into service to carry his torture stake
33  and when they came to a place called golʹgotha that is skull place
34  they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink but after tasting it he refused to drink it
35  when they had nailed him to the stake they distributed his outer garments by casting lots
36  and they sat there keeping watch over him
37  they also posted above his head the charge against him in writing this is jesus the king of the jews
38  then two robbers were put on stakes alongside him one on his right and one on his left
39  and those passing by spoke abusively of him shaking their heads
40  and saying you who would throw down the temple and build it in three days save yourself if you are a son of god come down off the torture stake
41  in the same way also the chief priests with the scribes and the elders began mocking him saying
42  others he saved himself he cannot save he is king of israel let him now come down off the torture stake and we will believe in him
43  he has put his trust in god let him now rescue him if he wants him for he said i am gods son
44  in the same way even the robbers who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him
45  from the sixth hour on a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour
46  about the ninth hour jesus called out with a loud voice saying eʹli eʹli laʹma sabachthaʹni that is my god my god why have you forsaken me
47  at hearing this some of those standing there began to say this man is calling eliʹjah
48  and immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it in sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink
49  but the rest of them said let him be let us see whether eliʹjah comes to save him
50  again jesus called out with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit
51  and look the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom and the earth quaked and the rocks were split
52  and the tombs were opened and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised up
53  and people coming out from among the tombs after his being raised up entered into the holy city and they became visible to many people
54  but when the army officer and those with him keeping watch over jesus saw the earthquake and the things happening they grew very much afraid and said certainly this was gods son
55  and many women were there watching from a distance who had accompanied jesus from galʹilee to minister to him
56  among them were mary magʹdalene and mary the mother of james and joʹses and the mother of the sons of zebʹedee
57  now as it was late in the afternoon a rich man of arimatheʹa came named joseph who had also become a disciple of jesus
58  this man approached pilate and asked for the body of jesus
then pilate commanded that it be given to him
59  joseph took the body wrapped it up in clean fine linen
60  and laid it in his new tomb which he had quarried in the rock
and after rolling a big stone to the entrance of the tomb he left
61  but mary magʹdalene and the other mary continued there sitting before the grave
62  the next day which was after the preparation the chief priests and the pharisees gathered together before pilate
63  saying sir we recall what that impostor said while he was still alive after three days i am to be raised up
64  therefore command that the grave be made secure until the third day so that his disciples may not come and steal him and say to the people he was raised up from the dead then this last deception will be worse than the first
65  pilate said to them you may have a guard
go make it as secure as you know how
66  so they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone and posting a guard
7  stop judging that you may not be judged
2  for with the judgment you are judging you will be judged and with the measure that you are measuring out they will measure out to you
3  why then do you look at the straw in your brothers eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye
4  or how can you say to your brother allow me to remove the straw from your eye when look a rafter is in your own eye
5  hypocrite first remove the rafter from your own eye and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw from your brothers eye
6  do not give what is holy to dogs nor throw your pearls before swine so that they may never trample them under their feet and turn around and rip you open
7  keep on asking and it will be given you keep on seeking and you will find keep on knocking and it will be opened to you
8  for everyone asking receives and everyone seeking finds and to everyone knocking it will be opened
9  indeed which one of you if his son asks for bread will hand him a stone
10  or if he asks for a fish he will not hand him a serpent will he
11  therefore if you although being wicked know how to give good gifts to your children how much more so will your father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him
12  all things therefore that you want men to do to you you also must do to them
this in fact is what the law and the prophets mean
13  go in through the narrow gate because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction and many are going in through it
14  whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life and few are finding it
15  be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheeps covering but inside they are ravenous wolves
16  by their fruits you will recognize them
never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles do they
17  likewise every good tree produces fine fruit but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit
18  a good tree cannot bear worthless fruit nor can a rotten tree produce fine fruit
19  every tree not producing fine fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
20  really then by their fruits you will recognize those men
21  not everyone saying to me lord lord will enter into the kingdom of the heavens but only the one doing the will of my father who is in the heavens will
22  many will say to me in that day lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and expel demons in your name and perform many powerful works in your name
23  and then i will declare to them i never knew you get away from me you workers of lawlessness
24  therefore everyone who hears these sayings of mine and does them will be like a discreet man who built his house on the rock
25  and the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house but it did not cave in for it had been founded on the rock
26  furthermore everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand
27  and the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house and it caved in and its collapse was great
28  when jesus finished these sayings the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching
29  for he was teaching them as a person having authority and not as their scribes
23  then jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples saying
2  the scribes and the pharisees have seated themselves in the seat of moses
3  therefore all the things they tell you do and observe but do not do according to their deeds for they say but they do not practice what they say
4  they bind up heavy loads and put them on the shoulders of men but they themselves are not willing to budge them with their finger
5  all the works they do they do to be seen by men for they broaden the scripturecontaining cases that they wear as safeguards and lengthen the fringes of their garments
6  they like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues
7  and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called rabbi by men
8  but you do not you be called rabbi for one is your teacher and all of you are brothers
9  moreover do not call anyone your father on earth for one is your father the heavenly one
10  neither be called leaders for your leader is one the christ
11  but the greatest one among you must be your minister
12  whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted
13  woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men for you yourselves do not go in neither do you permit those on their way in to go in
14  
15  woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you travel over sea and dry land to make one proselyte and when he becomes one you make him a subject for gehenʹna twice as much so as yourselves
16  woe to you blind guides who say if anyone swears by the temple it is nothing but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple he is under obligation
17  fools and blind ones which in fact is greater the gold or the temple that has sanctified the gold
18  moreover if anyone swears by the altar it is nothing but if anyone swears by the gift on it he is under obligation
19  blind ones which in fact is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift
20  therefore whoever swears by the altar is swearing by it and by all the things on it
21  and whoever swears by the temple is swearing by it and by the one inhabiting it
22  and whoever swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of god and by the one sitting on it
23  woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you give the tenth of the mint and the dill and the cumin but you have disregarded the weightier matters of the law namely justice and mercy and faithfulness
these things it was necessary to do yet not to disregard the other things
24  blind guides who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel
25  woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside they are full of greediness and selfindulgence
26  blind pharisee cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish so that the outside of it may also become clean
27  woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you resemble whitewashed graves which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead mens bones and of every sort of uncleanness
28  in the same way on the outside you appear righteous to men but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness
29  woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you build the graves of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous ones
30  and you say if we had lived in the days of our forefathers we would not have shared with them in shedding the blood of the prophets
31  therefore you are testifying against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets
32  well then fill up the measure of your forefathers
33  serpents offspring of vipers how will you flee from the judgment of gehenʹna
34  for this reason i am sending to you prophets and wise men and public instructors
some of them you will kill and execute on stakes and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city
35  so that there may come upon you all the righteous blood spilled on earth from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zechariʹah son of barachiʹah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar
36  truly i say to you all these things will come upon this generation
37  jerusalem jerusalem the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent to herhow often i wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you did not want it
38  look your house is abandoned to you
39  for i say to you you will by no means see me from now until you say blessed is the one who comes in jehovahs name
22  once more jesus spoke to them with illustrations saying
2  the kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who made a marriage feast for his son
3  and he sent his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast but they were unwilling to come
4  again he sent other slaves saying tell those invited look i have prepared my dinner my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered and everything is ready
come to the marriage feast
5  but unconcerned they went off one to his own field another to his business
6  but the rest seizing his slaves treated them insolently and killed them
7  the king grew wrathful and sent his armies and killed those murderers and burned their city
8  then he said to his slaves the marriage feast is ready but those invited were not worthy
9  therefore go to the roads leading out of the city and invite anyone you find to the marriage feast
10  accordingly those slaves went out to the roads and gathered all they found both wicked and good and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those dining
11  when the king came in to inspect the guests he caught sight of a man not wearing a marriage garment
12  so he said to him fellow how did you get in here without a marriage garment he was speechless
13  then the king said to his servants bind him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside
there is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be
14  for there are many invited but few chosen
15  then the pharisees went and conspired together in order to trap him in his speech
16  so they sent their disciples to him together with party followers of herod saying teacher we know you are truthful and teach the way of god in truth and you do not seek anyones favor for you do not look at the outward appearance of people
17  tell us then what do you think is it lawful to pay head tax to caesar or not
18  but jesus knowing their wickedness said why do you put me to the test hypocrites
19  show me the tax coin
they brought him a denarʹius
20  he said to them whose image and inscription is this
21  they said caesars
then he said to them pay back therefore caesars things to caesar but gods things to god
22  when they heard that they were amazed and they left him and went away
23  on that day the sadducees who say there is no resurrection came and asked him
24  teacher moses said if any man dies without having children his brother must marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother
25  now there were seven brothers with us
the first married and died and having no offspring he left his wife for his brother
26  the same thing happened with the second and the third through all seven
27  last of all the woman died
28  so in the resurrection of the seven whose wife will she be for they all had her as a wife
29  in reply jesus said to them you are mistaken because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god
30  for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage but they are as angels in heaven
31  regarding the resurrection of the dead have you not read what was spoken to you by god who said
32  i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is the god not of the dead but of the living
33  on hearing that the crowds were astounded at his teaching
34  after the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they came together in one group
35  and one of them versed in the law tested him by asking
36  teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law
37  he said to him you must love jehovah your god with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind
38  this is the greatest and first commandment
39  the second like it is this you must love your neighbor as yourself
40  on these two commandments the whole law hangs and the prophets
41  now while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them
42  what do you think about the christ whose son is he they said to him davids
43  he asked them how is it then that david under inspiration calls him lord saying
44  jehovah said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies beneath your feet
45  if then david calls him lord how is he his son
46  and nobody was able to say a word in reply to him and from that day on no one dared to question him any further
6  take care not to practice your righteousness in front of men to be noticed by them otherwise you will have no reward with your father who is in the heavens
2  so when you make gifts of mercy do not blow a trumpet ahead of you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be glorified by men
truly i say to you they have their reward in full
3  but you when making gifts of mercy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
4  so that your gifts of mercy may be in secret
then your father who looks on in secret will repay you
5  also when you pray do not act like the hypocrites for they like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the main streets to be seen by men
truly i say to you they have their reward in full
6  but when you pray go into your private room and after shutting your door pray to your father who is in secret
then your father who looks on in secret will repay you
7  when praying do not say the same things over and over again as the people of the nations do for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words
8  so do not be like them for your father knows what you need even before you ask him
9  you must pray then this way our father in the heavens let your name be sanctified
10  let your kingdom come
let your will take place as in heaven also on earth
11  give us today our bread for this day
12  and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors
13  and do not bring us into temptation but deliver us from the wicked one
14  for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you
15  whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
16  when you fast stop becoming sadfaced like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces so they may appear to men to be fasting
truly i say to you they have their reward in full
17  but you when fasting put oil on your head and wash your face
18  so that you may not appear to be fasting to men but only to your father who is in secret
then your father who looks on in secret will repay you
19  stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal
20  rather store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal
21  for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
22  the lamp of the body is the eye
if then your eye is focused your whole body will be bright
23  but if your eye is envious your whole body will be dark
if the light that is in you is really darkness how great that darkness is
24  no one can slave for two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will stick to the one and despise the other
you cannot slave for god and for riches
25  on this account i say to you stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink or about your bodies as to what you will wear
does not life mean more than food and the body than clothing
26  observe intently the birds of heaven they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses yet your heavenly father feeds them
are you not worth more than they are
27  who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span
28  also why are you anxious about clothing take a lesson from the lilies of the field how they grow they do not toil nor do they spin
29  but i tell you that not even solʹomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these
30  now if this is how god clothes the vegetation of the field that is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much rather clothe you you with little faith
31  so never be anxious and say what are we to eat or what are we to drink or what are we to wear
32  for all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing
your heavenly father knows that you need all these things
33  keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness and all these other things will be added to you
34  so never be anxious about the next day for the next day will have its own anxieties
each day has enough of its own troubles
21  when they got close to jerusalem and arrived at bethʹphage on the mount of olives then jesus sent two disciples
2  saying to them go into the village that is within sight and you will at once find a donkey tied and a colt with her
untie them and bring them to me
3  if someone says anything to you you must say the lord needs them
at that he will immediately send them
4  this actually took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet who said
5  tell the daughter of zion look your king is coming to you mildtempered and mounted on a donkey yes on a colt the offspring of a beast of burden
6  so the disciples went and did just as jesus had instructed them
7  they brought the donkey and its colt and they put their outer garments on them and he sat on them
8  most of the crowd spread their outer garments on the road while others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road
9  moreover the crowds going ahead of him and those following him kept shouting save we pray the son of david blessed is the one who comes in jehovahs name save him we pray in the heights above
10  and when he entered jerusalem the whole city was in an uproar saying who is this
11  the crowds kept saying this is the prophet jesus from nazʹareth of galʹilee
12  jesus entered the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves
13  and he said to them it is written my house will be called a house of prayer but you are making it a cave of robbers
14  also blind and lame people came to him in the temple and he cured them
15  when the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys who were shouting in the temple save we pray the son of david they became indignant
16  and said to him do you hear what these are saying jesus said to them yes
did you never read this out of the mouth of children and infants you have brought forth praise
17  and leaving them behind he went out of the city to bethʹany and spent the night there
18  while returning to the city early in the morning he felt hungry
19  he caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it but he found nothing on it except leaves and he said to it let no fruit come from you ever again
and the fig tree withered instantly
20  when the disciples saw this they were amazed and said how is it that the fig tree withered instantly
21  in answer jesus said to them truly i say to you if you have faith and do not doubt not only will you do what i did to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea it will happen
22  and all the things you ask in prayer having faith you will receive
23  after he went into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said by what authority do you do these things and who gave you this authority
24  in reply jesus said to them i will also ask you one thing
if you tell me then i will also tell you by what authority i do these things
25  the baptism by john from what source was it from heaven or from men but they began to reason among themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say to us why then did you not believe him
26  but if we say from men we have the crowd to fear for they all regard john as a prophet
27  so they answered jesus we do not know
he in turn said to them neither am i telling you by what authority i do these things
28  what do you think a man had two children
going up to the first he said child go work today in the vineyard
29  in answer this one said i will not but afterward he felt regret and went out
30  approaching the second he said the same
this one replied i will sir but did not go out
31  which of the two did the will of his father they said the first
jesus said to them truly i say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of god
32  for john came to you in a way of righteousness but you did not believe him
however the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him and even when you saw this you did not feel regret afterward so as to believe him
33  hear another illustration there was a man a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad
34  when the fruit season came around he sent his slaves to the cultivators to collect his fruit
35  however the cultivators took his slaves and they beat one up another they killed another they stoned
36  again he sent other slaves more than the first group but they did the same to these
37  lastly he sent his son to them saying they will respect my son
38  on seeing the son the cultivators said among themselves this is the heir
come let us kill him and get his inheritance
39  so they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
40  therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those cultivators
41  they said to him because they are evil he will bring a terrible destruction on them and will lease the vineyard to other cultivators who will give him the fruits when they become due
42  jesus said to them did you never read in the scriptures the stone that the builders rejected this has become the chief cornerstone
this has come from jehovah and it is marvelous in our eyes
43  this is why i say to you the kingdom of god will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits
44  also the person falling on this stone will be shattered
as for anyone on whom it falls it will crush him
45  when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his illustrations they knew that he was speaking about them
46  although they wanted to seize him they feared the crowds because these regarded him as a prophet
25  then the kingdom of the heavens may be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom
2  five of them were foolish and five were discreet
3  for the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them
4  whereas the discreet took oil in their flasks along with their lamps
5  while the bridegroom was delaying they all became drowsy and fell asleep
6  right in the middle of the night there was a shout here is the bridegroom go out to meet him
7  then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order
8  the foolish said to the discreet give us some of your oil because our lamps are about to go out
9  the discreet answered saying perhaps there may not be enough for both us and you
go instead to those who sell it and buy some for yourselves
10  while they were going off to buy it the bridegroom came
the virgins who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut
11  afterward the rest of the virgins also came saying sir sir open to us
12  in answer he said i tell you the truth i do not know you
13  keep on the watch therefore because you know neither the day nor the hour
14  for it is just like a man about to travel abroad who summoned his slaves and entrusted his belongings to them
15  he gave five talents to one two to another and one to still another to each according to his own ability and he went abroad
16  immediately the one who received the five talents went and did business with them and gained five more
17  likewise the one who received the two gained two more
18  but the slave who received just one went off and dug in the ground and hid his masters money
19  after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them
20  so the one who had received the five talents came forward and brought five additional talents saying master you entrusted five talents to me see i gained five talents more
21  his master said to him well done good and faithful slave you were faithful over a few things
i will appoint you over many things
enter into the joy of your master
22  next the one who had received the two talents came forward and said master you entrusted two talents to me see i gained two talents more
23  his master said to him well done good and faithful slave you were faithful over a few things
i will appoint you over many things
enter into the joy of your master
24  finally the slave who had received the one talent came forward and said master i knew you to be a demanding man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow
25  so i grew afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground
here you have what is yours
26  in reply his master said to him wicked and sluggish slave you knew did you that i reaped where i did not sow and gathered where i did not winnow
27  well then you should have deposited my money with the bankers and on my coming i would have received it back with interest
28  therefore take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents
29  for to everyone who has more will be given and he will have an abundance
but the one who does not have even what he has will be taken away from him
30  and throw the goodfornothing slave out into the darkness outside
there is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be
31  when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit down on his glorious throne
32  all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate people one from another just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
33  and he will put the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left
34  then the king will say to those on his right come you who have been blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world
35  for i became hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink
i was a stranger and you received me hospitably
36  naked and you clothed me
i fell sick and you looked after me
i was in prison and you visited me
37  then the righteous ones will answer him with the words lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
38  when did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably or naked and clothe you
39  when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you
40  in reply the king will say to them truly i say to you to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
41  then he will say to those on his left go away from me you who have been cursed into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
42  for i became hungry but you gave me nothing to eat and i was thirsty but you gave me nothing to drink
43  i was a stranger but you did not receive me hospitably naked but you did not clothe me sick and in prison but you did not look after me
44  then they too will answer with the words lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you
45  then he will answer them saying truly i say to you to the extent that you did not do it to one of these least ones you did not do it to me
46  these will depart into everlasting cuttingoff but the righteous ones into everlasting life
13  on that day jesus left the house and was sitting by the sea
2  and such large crowds gathered to him that he went aboard a boat and sat down and all the crowd was standing on the beach
3  then he told them many things by illustrations saying look a sower went out to sow
4  as he was sowing some seeds fell alongside the road and the birds came and ate them up
5  others fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil and they immediately sprang up because the soil was not deep
6  but when the sun rose they were scorched and they withered because they had no root
7  others fell among the thorns and the thorns came up and choked them
8  still others fell on the fine soil and they began to yield fruit this one 100 times more that one 60 the other 30
9  let the one who has ears listen
10  so the disciples came and said to him why do you speak to them by the use of illustrations
11  in reply he said to you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the kingdom of the heavens but to them it is not granted
12  for whoever has more will be given him and he will be made to abound but whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him
13  that is why i speak to them by the use of illustrations for looking they look in vain and hearing they hear in vain nor do they get the sense of it
14  and the prophecy of isaiah is being fulfilled in their case
it says you will indeed hear but by no means get the sense of it and you will indeed look but by no means see
15  for the heart of this people has grown unreceptive and with their ears they have heard without response and they have shut their eyes so that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and get the sense of it with their hearts and turn back and i heal them
16  however happy are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear
17  for truly i say to you many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them
18  now listen to the illustration of the man who sowed
19  where anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not get the sense of it the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart this is the one sown alongside the road
20  as for the one sown on rocky ground this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy
21  yet he has no root in himself but continues for a time and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word he is at once stumbled
22  as for the one sown among the thorns this is the one hearing the word but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
23  as for the one sown upon the fine soil this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it who really does bear fruit and produces this one 100 times more that one 60 the other 30
24  he presented another illustration to them saying the kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a man who sowed fine seed in his field
25  while men were sleeping his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat and left
26  when the stalk sprouted and produced fruit then the weeds also appeared
27  so the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him master did you not sow fine seed in your field how then does it have weeds
28  he said to them an enemy a man did this
the slaves said to him do you want us then to go out and collect them
29  he said no for fear that while collecting the weeds you uproot the wheat with them
30  let both grow together until the harvest and in the harvest season i will tell the reapers first collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up then gather the wheat into my storehouse
31  he presented another illustration to them saying the kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard grain that a man took and planted in his field
32  it is in fact the tiniest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the largest of the vegetable plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of heaven come and find lodging among its branches
33  he told them another illustration the kingdom of the heavens is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures of flour until the whole mass was fermented
34  all these things jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations
indeed without an illustration he would not speak to them
35  in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet who said i will open my mouth with illustrations i will proclaim things hidden since the founding
36  then after dismissing the crowds he went into the house
his disciples came to him and said explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field
37  in response he said the sower of the fine seed is the son of man
38  the field is the world
as for the fine seed these are the sons of the kingdom but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one
39  and the enemy who sowed them is the devil
the harvest is a conclusion of a system of things and the reapers are angels
40  therefore just as the weeds are collected and burned with fire so it will be in the conclusion of the system of things
41  the son of man will send his angels and they will collect out from his kingdom all things that cause stumbling and people who practice lawlessness
42  and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace
there is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be
43  at that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the kingdom of their father
let the one who has ears listen
44  the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field that a man found and hid and because of his joy he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field
45  again the kingdom of the heavens is like a traveling merchant seeking fine pearls
46  upon finding one pearl of high value he went away and promptly sold all the things he had and bought it
47  again the kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet let down into the sea and gathering fish of every kind
48  when it was full they hauled it up onto the beach and sitting down they collected the fine ones into containers but the unsuitable they threw away
49  that is how it will be in the conclusion of the system of things
the angels will go out and separate the wicked from among the righteous
50  and will cast them into the fiery furnace
there is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be
51  did you get the sense of all these things they said to him yes
52  then he said to them that being the case every public instructor who is taught about the kingdom of the heavens is like a man the master of the house who brings out of his treasure store things both new and old
53  when jesus had finished these illustrations he departed from there
54  after coming into his home territory he began to teach them in their synagogue so that they were astounded and said where did this man get this wisdom and these powerful works
55  is this not the carpenters son is not his mother called mary and his brothers james and joseph and simon and judas
56  and his sisters are they not all with us where then did he get all of this
57  so they began to stumble because of him
but jesus said to them a prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and in his own house
58  and he did not perform many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith
14  at that time herod the district ruler heard the report about jesus
2  and said to his servants this is john the baptist
he was raised up from the dead and this is why these powerful works are operating in him
3  herod had arrested john and had bound him and imprisoned him because of heroʹdias the wife of philip his brother
4  for john had been saying to him it is not lawful for you to have her
5  however although he wanted to kill him he feared the crowd because they took him for a prophet
6  but when herods birthday was being celebrated the daughter of heroʹdias danced for the occasion and pleased herod so much
7  that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked
8  then she at her mothers prompting said give me here on a platter the head of john the baptist
9  grieved though he was the king out of regard for his oaths and for those dining with him commanded it to be given
10  so he sent and had john beheaded in the prison
11  his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl and she brought it to her mother
12  later his disciples came and removed his corpse and buried him then they came and reported to jesus
13  at hearing this jesus departed from there by boat into an isolated place to be alone
but the crowds getting to hear of it followed him on foot from the cities
14  when he came ashore he saw a large crowd and he felt pity for them and he cured their sick ones
15  but when evening fell his disciples came to him and said the place is isolated and the hour is already late send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food
16  however jesus said to them they do not have to leave you give them something to eat
17  they said to him we have nothing here except five loaves and two fish
18  he said bring them here to me
19  and he instructed the crowds to recline on the grass
then he took the five loaves and two fish and looking up to heaven he said a blessing and after breaking the loaves he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
20  so they all ate and were satisfied and they took up the leftover fragments 12 baskets full
21  now those eating were about 5000 men as well as women and young children
22  then without delay he made his disciples board the boat and go ahead of him to the opposite shore while he sent the crowds away
23  after sending the crowds away he went up on the mountain by himself to pray
when evening came he was there alone
24  by now the boat was many hundreds of yards away from land struggling against the waves because the wind was against them
25  but in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea
26  when they caught sight of him walking on the sea the disciples were troubled saying it is an apparition and they cried out in their fear
27  but at once jesus spoke to them saying take courage it is i do not be afraid
28  peter answered him lord if it is you command me to come to you over the waters
29  he said come so peter got out of the boat and walked over the waters and went toward jesus
30  but looking at the windstorm he became afraid
and when he started to sink he cried out lord save me
31  immediately stretching out his hand jesus caught hold of him and said to him you with little faith why did you give way to doubt
32  after they got up into the boat the windstorm abated
33  then those in the boat did obeisance to him saying you really are gods son
34  and they crossed over and came to land in gennesʹaret
35  on recognizing him the men of that place sent word into all that surrounding country and people brought him all those who were ill
36  and they pleaded with him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment and all those who touched it were made completely well
19  when jesus had finished speaking these things he departed from galʹilee and came to the borders of judeʹa across the jordan
2  also large crowds followed him and he cured them there
3  and pharisees came to him intent on testing him and they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of grounds
4  in reply he said have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female
5  and said for this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife and the two will be one flesh
6  so that they are no longer two but one flesh
therefore what god has yoked together let no man put apart
7  they said to him why then did moses direct giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her
8  he said to them out of regard for your hardheartedness moses made the concession to you of divorcing your wives but that has not been the case from the beginning
9  i say to you that whoever divorces his wife except on the grounds of sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery
10  the disciples said to him if that is the situation of a man with his wife it is not advisable to marry
11  he said to them not all men make room for the saying but only those who have the gift
12  for there are eunuchs who were born that way and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs on account of the kingdom of the heavens
let the one who can make room for it make room for it
13  then young children were brought to him for him to place his hands on them and offer prayer but the disciples reprimanded them
14  jesus however said let the young children alone and do not try to stop them from coming to me for the kingdom of the heavens belongs to such ones
15  and he placed his hands on them and departed from there
16  now look someone came up to him and said teacher what good must i do to gain everlasting life
17  he said to him why do you ask me about what is good one there is who is good
if though you want to enter into life observe the commandments continually
18  he said to him which ones jesus said you must not murder you must not commit adultery you must not steal you must not bear false witness
19  honor your father and your mother and you must love your neighbor as yourself
20  the young man said to him i have kept all of these what am i still lacking
21  jesus said to him if you want to be perfect go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come be my follower
22  when the young man heard this he went away grieved for he had many possessions
23  then jesus said to his disciples truly i say to you that it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of the heavens
24  again i say to you it is easier for a camel to get through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
25  when the disciples heard that they were greatly astounded saying who really can be saved
26  looking at them intently jesus said to them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
27  then peter said in reply look we have left all things and followed you what then will there be for us
28  jesus said to them truly i say to you in the recreation when the son of man sits down on his glorious throne you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of israel
29  and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit everlasting life
30  but many who are first will be last and the last first
24  now as jesus was departing from the temple his disciples approached to show him the buildings of the temple
2  in response he said to them do you not see all these things truly i say to you by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down
3  while he was sitting on the mount of olives the disciples approached him privately saying tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things
4  in answer jesus said to them look out that nobody misleads you
5  for many will come on the basis of my name saying i am the christ and will mislead many
6  you are going to hear of wars and reports of wars
see that you are not alarmed for these things must take place but the end is not yet
7  for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another
8  all these things are a beginning of pangs of distress
9  then people will hand you over to tribulation and will kill you and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name
10  then too many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another
11  many false prophets will arise and mislead many
12  and because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will grow cold
13  but the one who has endured to the end will be saved
14  and this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations and then the end will come
15  therefore when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation as spoken about by daniel the prophet standing in a holy place let the reader use discernment
16  then let those in judeʹa begin fleeing to the mountains
17  let the man on the housetop not come down to take the goods out of his house
18  and let the man in the field not return to pick up his outer garment
19  woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days
20  keep praying that your flight may not occur in wintertime nor on the sabbath day
21  for then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the worlds beginning until now no nor will occur again
22  in fact unless those days were cut short no flesh would be saved but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short
23  then if anyone says to you look here is the christ or there do not believe it
24  for false christs and false prophets will arise and will perform great signs and wonders so as to mislead if possible even the chosen ones
25  look i have forewarned you
26  therefore if people say to you look he is in the wilderness do not go out look he is in the inner rooms do not believe it
27  for just as the lightning comes out of the east and shines over to the west so the presence of the son of man will be
28  wherever the carcass is there the eagles will be gathered together
29  immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will be shaken
30  then the sign of the son of man will appear in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
31  and he will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity
32  now learn this illustration from the fig tree just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves you know that summer is near
33  likewise also you when you see all these things know that he is near at the doors
34  truly i say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen
35  heaven and earth will pass away but my words will by no means pass away
36  concerning that day and hour nobody knows neither the angels of the heavens nor the son but only the father
37  for just as the days of noah were so the presence of the son of man will be
38  for as they were in those days before the flood eating and drinking men marrying and women being given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark
39  and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away so the presence of the son of man will be
40  then two men will be in the field one will be taken along and the other abandoned
41  two women will be grinding at the hand mill one will be taken along and the other abandoned
42  keep on the watch therefore because you do not know on what day your lord is coming
43  but know one thing if the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into
44  on this account you too prove yourselves ready because the son of man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it
45  who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time
46  happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so
47  truly i say to you he will appoint him over all his belongings
48  but if ever that evil slave says in his heart my master is delaying
49  and he starts to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards
50  the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and in an hour that he does not know
51  and he will punish him with the greatest severity and will assign him his place with the hypocrites
there is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be
5  when he saw the crowds he went up on the mountain and after he sat down his disciples came to him
2  then he opened his mouth and began teaching them saying
3  happy are those conscious of their spiritual need since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them
4  happy are those who mourn since they will be comforted
5  happy are the mildtempered since they will inherit the earth
6  happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness since they will be filled
7  happy are the merciful since they will be shown mercy
8  happy are the pure in heart since they will see god
9  happy are the peacemakers since they will be called sons of god
10  happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them
11  happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake
12  rejoice and be overjoyed since your reward is great in the heavens for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you
13  you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses its strength how will its saltiness be restored it is no longer usable for anything except to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men
14  you are the light of the world
a city cannot be hid when located on a mountain
15  people light a lamp and set it not under a basket but on the lampstand and it shines on all those in the house
16  likewise let your light shine before men so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your father who is in the heavens
17  do not think i came to destroy the law or the prophets
i came not to destroy but to fulfill
18  truly i say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one stroke of a letter to pass away from the law until all things take place
19  whoever therefore breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in relation to the kingdom of the heavens
but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in relation to the kingdom of the heavens
20  for i say to you that if your righteousness does not surpass that of the scribes and the pharisees you will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens
21  you heard that it was said to those of ancient times you must not murder but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice
22  however i say to you that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice and whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the supreme court whereas whoever says you despicable fool will be liable to the fiery gehenʹna
23  if then you are bringing your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you
24  leave your gift there in front of the altar and go away
first make your peace with your brother and then come back and offer your gift
25  be quick to settle matters with your legal opponent while you are with him on the way there so that somehow the opponent may not turn you over to the judge and the judge to the court attendant and you get thrown into prison
26  i say to you for a fact you will certainly not come out of there until you have paid over your last small coin
27  you heard that it was said you must not commit adultery
28  but i say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart
29  if now your right eye is making you stumble tear it out and throw it away from you
for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be pitched into gehenʹna
30  also if your right hand is making you stumble cut it off and throw it away from you
for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to land in gehenʹna
31  moreover it was said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce
32  however i say to you that everyone divorcing his wife except on account of sexual immorality makes her a subject for adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery
33  again you heard that it was said to those of ancient times you must not swear without performing but you must pay your vows to jehovah
34  however i say to you do not swear at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne
35  nor by earth for it is the footstool of his feet nor by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
36  do not swear by your head since you cannot turn one hair white or black
37  just let your word yes mean yes your no no for what goes beyond these is from the wicked one
38  you heard that it was said eye for eye and tooth for tooth
39  however i say to you do not resist the one who is wicked but whoever slaps you on your right cheek turn the other also to him
40  and if a person wants to take you to court and get possession of your inner garment let him also have your outer garment
41  and if someone in authority compels you into service for a mile go with him two miles
42  give to the one asking you and do not turn away from one who wants to borrow from you
43  you heard that it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy
44  however i say to you continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you
45  so that you may prove yourselves sons of your father who is in the heavens since he makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous
46  for if you love those loving you what reward do you have are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing
47  and if you greet your brothers only what extraordinary thing are you doing are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing
48  you must accordingly be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect
15  then there came to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes saying
2  why do your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times for example they do not wash their hands when about to eat a meal
3  in reply he said to them why do you overstep the commandment of god because of your tradition
4  for example god said honor your father and your mother and let the one who speaks abusively of his father or mother be put to death
5  but you say whoever says to his father or mother whatever i have that could benefit you is a gift dedicated to god
6  he need not honor his father at all
so you have made the word of god invalid because of your tradition
7  you hypocrites isaiah aptly prophesied about you when he said
8  this people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far removed from me
9  it is in vain that they keep worshipping me for they teach commands of men as doctrines
10  with that he called the crowd near and said to them listen and get the sense of it
11  it is not what enters into a mans mouth that defiles him but it is what comes out of his mouth that defiles him
12  then the disciples came and said to him do you know that the pharisees were stumbled at hearing what you said
13  in reply he said every plant that my heavenly father did not plant will be uprooted
14  let them be
blind guides is what they are
if then a blind man guides a blind man both will fall into a pit
15  peter responded make the illustration plain to us
16  at this he said are you also still without understanding
17  are you not aware that whatever enters into the mouth passes through the stomach and is discharged into the sewer
18  however whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart and those things defile a man
19  for example out of the heart come wicked reasonings murders adulteries sexual immorality thefts false testimonies blasphemies
20  these are the things that defile a man but to take a meal with unwashed hands does not defile a man
21  leaving there jesus now went into the region of tyre and siʹdon
22  and look a phoeniʹcian woman from that region came and cried out have mercy on me lord son of david
my daughter is cruelly demon possessed
23  but he did not say a word in answer to her
so his disciples came and began to urge him send her away because she keeps crying out after us
24  he answered i was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the house of israel
25  but the woman came and did obeisance to him saying lord help me
26  in answer he said it is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs
27  she said yes lord but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters
28  then jesus replied to her o woman great is your faith let it happen to you as you wish
and her daughter was healed from that hour on
29  departing from there jesus next came near the sea of galʹilee and after going up on the mountain he was sitting there
30  then large crowds approached him bringing along people who were lame maimed blind speechless and many others and they laid them at his feet and he cured them
31  so the crowd felt amazement as they saw the speechless speaking and the maimed being made sound and the lame walking and the blind seeing and they glorified the god of israel
32  but jesus called his disciples to him and said i feel pity for the crowd because they have already stayed with me for three days and they have had nothing to eat
i do not want to send them away hungry for they may give out on the road
33  however the disciples said to him where in this isolated place are we going to get enough bread to satisfy a crowd of this size
34  at this jesus said to them how many loaves do you have they said seven and a few small fish
35  so after instructing the crowd to recline on the ground
36  he took the seven loaves and the fish and after offering thanks he broke them and began giving them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the crowds
37  and all ate and were satisfied and they took up seven large baskets full of leftover fragments
38  now those eating were 4000 men as well as women and young children
39  finally after sending the crowds away he got into the boat and came into the region of magʹadan
20  for the kingdom of the heavens is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard
2  after he had agreed with the workers for a denarʹius a day he sent them into his vineyard
3  going out also about the third hour he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace
4  and to those he said you too go into the vineyard and i will give you whatever is fair
5  so off they went
again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise
6  finally about the 11th hour he went out and found others standing around and he said to them why have you been standing here all day unemployed
7  they replied because nobody has hired us
he said to them you too go into the vineyard
8  when evening came the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge call the workers and pay them their wages starting with the last and ending with the first
9  when the 11thhour men came they each received a denarʹius
10  so when the first came they assumed that they would receive more but they too were paid at the rate of a denarʹius
11  on receiving it they began to complain against the master of the house
12  and said these last men put in one hours work still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat
13  but he said in reply to one of them fellow i do you no wrong
you agreed with me for a denarʹius did you not
14  take what is yours and go
i want to give to this last one the same as to you
15  do i not have the right to do what i want with my own things or is your eye envious because i am good
16  in this way the last ones will be first and the first ones last
17  while going up to jerusalem jesus took the 12 disciples aside privately and said to them on the road
18  look we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes
they will condemn him to death
19  and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake and on the third day he will be raised up
20  then the mother of the sons of zebʹedee approached him with her sons doing obeisance and asking for something from him
21  he said to her what do you want she replied to him give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom
22  jesus answered you do not know what you are asking for
can you drink the cup that i am about to drink they said to him we can
23  he said to them you will indeed drink my cup but to sit down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my father
24  when the ten others heard about it they became indignant at the two brothers
25  but jesus called them to him and said you know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them
26  this must not be the way among you but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister
27  and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave
28  just as the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many
29  as they were going out of jerʹicho a large crowd followed him
30  and look two blind men sitting beside the road heard that jesus was passing by and cried out lord have mercy on us son of david
31  but the crowd rebuked them telling them to keep silent yet they cried all the louder saying lord have mercy on us son of david
32  so jesus stopped called them and said what do you want me to do for you
33  they said to him lord let our eyes be opened
34  moved with pity jesus touched their eyes and immediately they recovered their sight and they followed him
1  the book of the history of jesus christ son of david son of abraham
2  abraham became father to isaacisaac became father to jacobjacob became father to judah and his brothers
3  judah became father to peʹrez and zeʹrah by taʹmarpeʹrez became father to hezʹronhezʹron became father to ram
4  ram became father to amminʹadabamminʹadab became father to nahʹshonnahʹshon became father to salʹmon
5  salʹmon became father to boʹaz by raʹhabboʹaz became father to oʹbed by ruthoʹbed became father to jesʹse
6  jesʹse became father to david the king
david became father to solʹomon by the wife of uriʹah
7  solʹomon became father to rehoboʹamrehoboʹam became father to abiʹjahabiʹjah became father to aʹsa
8  aʹsa became father to jehoshʹaphatjehoshʹaphat became father to jehoʹramjehoʹram became father to uzziʹah
9  uzziʹah became father to joʹthamjoʹtham became father to aʹhazaʹhaz became father to hezekiʹah
10  hezekiʹah became father to manasʹsehmanasʹseh became father to aʹmonaʹmon became father to josiʹah
11  josiʹah became father to jeconiʹah and to his brothers at the time of the deportation to babylon
12  after the deportation to babylon jeconiʹah became father to shealʹtielshealʹtiel became father to zerubʹbabel
13  zerubʹbabel became father to abiʹudabiʹud became father to eliʹakimeliʹakim became father to aʹzor
14  aʹzor became father to zaʹdokzaʹdok became father to aʹchimaʹchim became father to eliʹud
15  eliʹud became father to eleaʹzareleaʹzar became father to matʹthanmatʹthan became father to jacob
16  jacob became father to joseph the husband of mary of whom jesus was born who is called christ
17  all the generations then from abraham until david were 14 generations from david until the deportation to babylon 14 generations from the deportation to babylon until the christ 14 generations
18  but this is how the birth of jesus christ took place
during the time his mother mary was promised in marriage to joseph she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit before they were united
19  however because her husband joseph was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle he intended to divorce her secretly
20  but after he had thought these things over look jehovahs angel appeared to him in a dream saying joseph son of david do not be afraid to take your wife mary home for what has been conceived in her is by holy spirit
21  she will give birth to a son and you are to name him jesus for he will save his people from their sins
22  all of this actually came about to fulfill what was spoken by jehovah through his prophet saying
23  look the virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son and they will name him immanʹuel which means when translated with us is god
24  then joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of jehovah had directed him and he took his wife home
25  but he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son and he named him jesus
2  after jesus had been born in bethʹlehem of judeʹa in the days of herod the king look astrologers from the east came to jerusalem
2  saying where is the one born king of the jews for we saw his star when we were in the east and we have come to do obeisance to him
3  at hearing this king herod was agitated and all jerusalem with him
4  on gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the christ was to be born
5  they said to him in bethʹlehem of judeʹa for this is how it has been written through the prophet
6  and you o bethʹlehem of the land of judah are by no means the most insignificant city among the governors of judah for out of you will come a governing one who will shepherd my people israel
7  then herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the stars appearing
8  when sending them to bethʹlehem he said go make a careful search for the young child and when you have found him report back to me so that i too may go and do obeisance to him
9  after they had heard the king they went their way and look the star they had seen when they were in the east went ahead of them until it came to a stop above where the young child was
10  on seeing the star they rejoiced with great joy
11  and when they went into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and falling down they did obeisance to him
they also opened their treasures and presented him with giftsgold and frankincense and myrrh
12  however because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to herod they departed for their country by another way
13  after they had departed look jehovahs angel appeared to joseph in a dream saying get up take the young child and his mother and flee to egypt and stay there until i give you word for herod is about to search for the young child to kill him
14  so joseph got up and by night took along the young child and the childs mother and went into egypt
15  he stayed there until the death of herod
this fulfilled what was spoken by jehovah through his prophet saying out of egypt i called my son
16  then herod seeing that he had been outwitted by the astrologers flew into a great rage and he sent out and had all the boys in bethʹlehem and in all its districts killed from two years of age and under according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the astrologers
17  then was fulfilled what was spoken through jeremiah the prophet who said
18  a voice was heard in raʹmah weeping and much wailing
it was rachel weeping for her children and she was unwilling to take comfort because they are no more
19  when herod had died look jehovahs angel appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt
20  and said get up take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for those who were seeking the life of the young child are dead
21  so he got up and took the young child and the childs mother and entered into the land of israel
22  but hearing that archelaʹus ruled judeʹa instead of his father herod he was afraid to go there
moreover being given divine warning in a dream he withdrew into the territory of galʹilee
23  and he came and settled in a city named nazʹareth in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets he will be called a nazareneʹ
3  in those days john the baptist came preaching in the wilderness of judeʹa
2  saying repent for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
3  this in fact is the one spoken of through isaiah the prophet in these words a voice of one calling out in the wilderness prepare the way of jehovah make his roads straight
4  now john was clothed with camels hair and had a leather belt around his waist
his food was locusts and wild honey
5  then the people of jerusalem and all judeʹa and all the country around the jordan were going out to him
6  and they were baptized by him in the jordan river openly confessing their sins
7  when he caught sight of many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to the baptism he said to them you offspring of vipers who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath
8  therefore produce fruit that befits repentance
9  do not presume to say to yourselves we have abraham as our father
for i say to you that god is able to raise up children for abraham from these stones
10  the ax is already lying at the root of the trees
every tree then that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire
11  i for my part baptize you with water because of your repentance but the one coming after me is stronger than i am whose sandals i am not worthy to take off
that one will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire
12  his winnowing shovel is in his hand and he will clean up his threshing floor completely and will gather his wheat into the storehouse but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out
13  then jesus came from galʹilee to the jordan to john in order to be baptized by him
14  but the latter tried to prevent him saying i am the one who needs to be baptized by you and are you coming to me
15  jesus replied to him let it be this time for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous
then he quit preventing him
16  after being baptized jesus immediately came up from the water and look the heavens were opened up and he saw gods spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him
17  look also a voice from the heavens said this is my son the beloved whom i have approved
12  at that time jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath
his disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat
2  at seeing this the pharisees said to him look your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath
3  he said to them have you not read what david did when he and the men with him were hungry
4  how he entered into the house of god and they ate the loaves of presentation something that it was not lawful for him or those with him to eat but for the priests only
5  or have you not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple violate the sabbath and continue guiltless
6  but i tell you that something greater than the temple is here
7  however if you had understood what this means i want mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the guiltless ones
8  for the son of man is lord of the sabbath
9  after departing from that place he went into their synagogue
10  and look there was a man with a withered hand so they asked him is it lawful to cure on the sabbath so that they might accuse him
11  he said to them if you have one sheep and that sheep falls into a pit on the sabbath is there a man among you who will not grab hold of it and lift it out
12  how much more valuable is a man than a sheep so it is lawful to do a fine thing on the sabbath
13  then he said to the man stretch out your hand
and he stretched it out and it was restored sound like the other hand
14  but the pharisees went out and conspired against him to kill him
15  having come to know this jesus departed from there
many also followed him and he cured them all
16  but he sternly ordered them not to make him known
17  in order to fulfill what was spoken through isaiah the prophet who said
18  look my servant whom i chose my beloved whom i have approved i will put my spirit upon him and what justice is he will make clear to the nations
19  he will not quarrel nor cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the main streets
20  no bruised reed will he crush and no smoldering wick will he extinguish until he brings justice with success
21  indeed in his name nations will hope
22  then they brought him a demonpossessed man who was blind and speechless and he cured him so that the speechless man could speak and see
23  well all the crowds were astounded and began to say may this not perhaps be the son of david
24  at hearing this the pharisees said this fellow does not expel the demons except by means of beelʹzebub the ruler of the demons
25  knowing their thoughts he said to them every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin and every city or house divided against itself will not stand
26  in the same way if satan expels satan he has become divided against himself how then will his kingdom stand
27  moreover if i expel the demons by means of beelʹzebub by whom do your sons expel them this is why they will be your judges
28  but if it is by means of gods spirit that i expel the demons the kingdom of god has really overtaken you
29  or how can anyone invade the house of a strong man and seize his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man only then can he plunder his house
30  whoever is not on my side is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters
31  for this reason i say to you every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven
32  for example whoever speaks a word against the son of man it will be forgiven him but whoever speaks against the holy spirit it will not be forgiven him no not in this system of things nor in that to come
33  either you make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten for by its fruit the tree is known
34  offspring of vipers how can you speak good things when you are wicked for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
35  the good man out of his good treasure sends out good things whereas the wicked man out of his wicked treasure sends out wicked things
36  i tell you that men will render an account on judgment day for every unprofitable saying that they speak
37  for by your words you will be declared righteous and by your words you will be condemned
38  then as an answer to him some of the scribes and the pharisees said teacher we want to see a sign from you
39  in reply he said to them a wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking a sign but no sign will be given it except the sign of joʹnah the prophet
40  for just as joʹnah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights so the son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights
41  men of ninʹeveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it because they repented at what joʹnah preached
but look something more than joʹnah is here
42  the queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solʹomon
but look something more than solʹomon is here
43  when an unclean spirit comes out of a man it passes through waterless places in search of a restingplace and finds none
44  then it says i will go back to my house from which i moved and on arriving it finds the house unoccupied but swept clean and adorned
45  then it goes and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself and after getting inside they dwell there and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first
that is how it will be also with this wicked generation
46  while he was yet speaking to the crowds his mother and brothers were standing outside seeking to speak to him
47  so someone said to him look your mother and your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to you
48  in reply he said to the one who spoke to him who is my mother and who are my brothers
49  and extending his hand toward his disciples he said look my mother and my brothers
50  for whoever does the will of my father who is in heaven that one is my brother and sister and mother
