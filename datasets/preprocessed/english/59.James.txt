4  what is the source of the wars and fights among you do they not originate from your fleshly desires that carry on a conflict within you
2  you desire and yet you do not have
you go on murdering and coveting and yet you are not able to obtain
you go on fighting and waging war
you do not have because of your not asking
3  when you do ask you do not receive because you are asking for a wrong purpose so that you may spend it on your fleshly desires
4  adulteresses do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with god whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world is making himself an enemy of god
5  or do you think that for no reason the scripture says the spirit that has taken up residence within us keeps enviously longing
6  however the undeserved kindness that he gives is greater
so it says god opposes the haughty ones but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones
7  therefore subject yourselves to god but oppose the devil and he will flee from you
8  draw close to god and he will draw close to you
cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you indecisive ones
9  give way to misery and mourn and weep
let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into despair
10  humble yourselves in the eyes of jehovah and he will exalt you
11  stop speaking against one another brothers
whoever speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against law and judges law
now if you judge law you are not a doer of law but a judge
12  there is only one who is lawgiver and judge the one who is able to save and to destroy
but you who are you to be judging your neighbor
13  come now you who say today or tomorrow we will travel to this city and will spend a year there and we will do business and make some profit
14  whereas you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow
for you are a mist that appears for a little while and then disappears
15  instead you should say if jehovah wills we will live and do this or that
16  but now you take pride in your arrogant boasting
all such boasting is wicked
17  therefore if someone knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it it is a sin for him
5  come now you rich men weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you
2  your riches have rotted and your clothing has become motheaten
3  your gold and silver have rusted away and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh
what you have stored up will be like a fire in the last days
4  look the wages you have withheld from the workers who harvested your fields keep crying out and the cries for help of the reapers have reached the ears of jehovah of armies
5  you have lived in luxury and for selfgratification on the earth
you have fattened your hearts on the day of slaughter
6  you have condemned you have murdered the righteous one
is he not opposing you
7  be patient then brothers until the presence of the lord
look the farmer keeps waiting for the precious fruit of the earth exercising patience over it until the early rain and the late rain arrive
8  you too exercise patience make your hearts firm because the presence of the lord has drawn close
9  do not grumble against one another brothers so that you do not get judged
look the judge is standing before the doors
10  brothers take as a pattern of the suffering of evil and the exercising of patience the prophets who spoke in the name of jehovah
11  look we consider happy those who have endured
you have heard of the endurance of job and have seen the outcome jehovah gave that jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful
12  above all my brothers stop swearing either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath
but let your yes mean yes and your no no so that you do not become liable to judgment
13  is there anyone suffering hardship among you let him carry on prayer
is there anyone in good spirits let him sing psalms
14  is there anyone sick among you let him call the elders of the congregation to him and let them pray over him applying oil to him in the name of jehovah
15  and the prayer of faith will make the sick one well and jehovah will raise him up
also if he has committed sins he will be forgiven
16  therefore openly confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed
a righteous mans supplication has a powerful effect
17  eli πjah was a man with feelings like ours and yet when he prayed earnestly for it not to rain it did not rain on the land for three years and six months
18  then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the land produced fruit
19  my brothers if anyone among you is led astray from the truth and another turns him back
20  know that whoever turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save him from death and will cover a multitude of sins
1  james a slave of god and of the lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes that are scattered about greetings
2  consider it all joy my brothers when you meet with various trials
3  knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith produces endurance
4  but let endurance complete its work so that you may be complete and sound in all respects not lacking in anything
5  so if any one of you is lacking in wisdom let him keep asking god for he gives generously to all and without reproaching and it will be given him
6  but let him keep asking in faith not doubting at all for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about
7  in fact that man should not expect to receive anything from jehovah
8  he is an indecisive man unsteady in all his ways
9  but let the lowly brother rejoice over his exaltation
10  and the rich one over his humiliation because like a flower of the field he will pass away
11  for just as the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the plant and its flower falls off and its outward beauty perishes so too the rich man will fade away in the midst of his pursuits
12  happy is the man who keeps on enduring trial because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life which jehovah promised to those who continue loving him
13  when under trial let no one say i am being tried by god
for with evil things god cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone
14  but each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire
15  then the desire when it has become fertile gives birth to sin in turn sin when it has been carried out brings forth death
16  do not be misled my beloved brothers
17  every good gift and every perfect present is from above coming down from the father of the celestial lights who does not vary or change like the shifting shadows
18  it was his will to bring us forth by the word of truth so that we would become a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
19  know this my beloved brothers everyone must be quick to listen slow to speak slow to anger
20  for mans anger does not bring about gods righteousness
21  therefore put away all filthiness and every trace of badness and accept with mildness the implanting of the word that is able to save you
22  however become doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves with false reasoning
23  for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer this one is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror
24  for he looks at himself and he goes away and immediately forgets what sort of person he is
25  but the one who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and continues in it has become not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work and he will be happy in what he does
26  if any man thinks he is a worshipper of god but does not keep a tight rein on his tongue he is deceiving his own heart and his worship is futile
27  the form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our god and father is this to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation and to keep oneself without spot from the world
2  my brothers you are not holding to the faith of our glorious lord jesus christ while showing favoritism are you
2  for if a man with gold rings on his fingers and in splendid clothing comes into your meeting but a poor man in filthy clothing also enters
3  do you look with favor on the one wearing the splendid clothing and say you take this seat here in a fine place and do you say to the poor one you keep standing or take that seat there under my footstool
4  if so do you not have class distinctions among yourselves and have you not become judges rendering wicked decisions
5  listen my beloved brothers
did not god choose those who are poor from the worlds standpoint to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those who love him
6  but you have dishonored the poor
is it not the rich who oppress you and drag you before law courts
7  do they not blaspheme the fine name by which you were called
8  if now you carry out the royal law according to the scripture you must love your neighbor as yourself you are doing quite well
9  but if you continue showing favoritism you are committing sin and you are convicted by the law as transgressors
10  for if anyone obeys all the law but makes a false step in one point he has become an offender against all of it
11  for the one who said you must not commit adultery also said you must not murder
if now you do not commit adultery but you do murder you have become a transgressor of law
12  keep on speaking and behaving in such a way as those do who are going to be judged by the law of a free people
13  for the one who does not practice mercy will have his judgment without mercy
mercy triumphs over judgment
14  of what benefit is it my brothers if someone says he has faith but he does not have works that faith cannot save him can it
15  if a brother or a sister is lacking clothing and enough food for the day
16  yet one of you says to them go in peace keep warm and well fed but you do not give them what they need for their body of what benefit is it
17  so too faith by itself without works is dead
18  nevertheless someone will say you have faith and i have works
show me your faith without the works and i will show you my faith by my works
19  you believe that there is one god do you you are doing quite well
and yet the demons believe and shudder
20  but do you care to know o empty man that faith without works is useless
21  was not abraham our father declared righteous by works after he offered up isaac his son on the altar
22  you see that his faith was active along with his works and his faith was perfected by his works
23  and the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham put faith in jehovah and it was counted to him as righteousness and he came to be called jehovahs friend
24  you see that a man is to be declared righteous by works and not by faith alone
25  in the same manner was not ra πhab the prostitute also declared righteous by works after she received the messengers hospitably and sent them out by another way
26  indeed just as the body without spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead
3  not many of you should become teachers my brothers knowing that we will receive heavier judgment
2  for we all stumble many times
if anyone does not stumble in word he is a perfect man able to bridle also his whole body
3  if we put bridles in the mouths of horses to make them obey us we guide also their whole body
4  look also at ships although they are so big and are driven by strong winds they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the man at the helm is inclined to go
5  so too the tongue is a small part of the body and yet it makes great brags
see how small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze
6  the tongue is also a fire
the tongue represents a world of unrighteousness among our body members for it defiles all the body and sets the whole course of life on fire and it is set on fire by gehen πna
7  for every kind of wild animal and bird and reptile and sea creature is to be tamed and has been tamed by humans
8  but no human can tame the tongue
it is unruly and injurious full of deadly poison
9  with it we praise jehovah the father and yet with it we curse men who have come into existence in the likeness of god
10  out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing
my brothers it is not right for things to happen this way
11  a spring does not cause the fresh water and the bitter water to bubble out of the same opening does it
12  my brothers a fig tree cannot produce olives or a grapevine figs can it neither can salt water produce fresh water
13  who is wise and understanding among you let him by his fine conduct demonstrate works performed with a mildness that comes from wisdom
14  but if you have bitter jealousy and contentiousness in your hearts do not be bragging and lying against the truth
15  this is not the wisdom that comes down from above it is earthly animalistic demonic
16  for wherever there are jealousy and contentiousness there will also be disorder and every vile thing
17  but the wisdom from above is first of all pure then peaceable reasonable ready to obey full of mercy and good fruits impartial not hypocritical
18  moreover the fruit of righteousness is sown in peaceful conditions for those who are making peace
