10  most truly i say to you the one who does not enter into the sheepfold through the door but climbs in by another way that one is a thief and a plunderer
2  but the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep
3  the doorkeeper opens to this one and the sheep listen to his voice
he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out
4  when he has brought all his own out he goes ahead of them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice
5  they will by no means follow a stranger but will flee from him because they do not know the voice of strangers
6  jesus spoke this comparison to them but they did not understand what he was saying to them
7  so jesus said again most truly i say to you i am the door for the sheep
8  all those who have come in place of me are thieves and plunderers but the sheep have not listened to them
9  i am the door whoever enters through me will be saved and that one will go in and out and find pasturage
10  the thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy
i have come that they may have life and have it in abundance
11  i am the fine shepherd the fine shepherd surrenders his life in behalf of the sheep
12  the hired man who is not a shepherd and to whom the sheep do not belong sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and fleesand the wolf snatches them and scatters them
13  because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep
14  i am the fine shepherd
i know my sheep and my sheep know me
15  just as the father knows me and i know the father and i surrender my life in behalf of the sheep
16  and i have other sheep which are not of this fold those too i must bring in and they will listen to my voice and they will become one flock one shepherd
17  this is why the father loves me because i surrender my life so that i may receive it again
18  no man takes it away from me but i surrender it of my own initiative
i have authority to surrender it and i have authority to receive it again
this commandment i received from my father
19  a division again resulted among the jews because of these words
20  many of them were saying he has a demon and is out of his mind
why do you listen to him
21  others said these are not the sayings of a demonized man
a demon cannot open blind peoples eyes can it
22  at that time the festival of dedication took place in jerusalem
it was wintertime
23  and jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of solʹomon
24  then the jews surrounded him and began to say to him how long are you going to keep us in suspense if you are the christ tell us plainly
25  jesus answered them i told you and yet you do not believe
the works that i am doing in my fathers name these bear witness about me
26  but you do not believe because you are not my sheep
27  my sheep listen to my voice and i know them and they follow me
28  i give them everlasting life and they will by no means ever be destroyed and no one will snatch them out of my hand
29  what my father has given me is something greater than all other things and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the father
30  i and the father are one
31  once again the jews picked up stones to stone him
32  jesus replied to them i displayed to you many fine works from the father
for which of those works are you stoning me
33  the jews answered him we are stoning you not for a fine work but for blasphemy for you although being a man make yourself a god
34  jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said you are gods
35  if he called gods those against whom the word of god cameand yet the scripture cannot be nullified
36  do you say to me whom the father sanctified and sent into the world you blaspheme because i said i am gods son
37  if i am not doing the works of my father do not believe me
38  but if i am doing them even though you do not believe me believe the works so that you may come to know and may continue knowing that the father is in union with me and i am in union with the father
39  so they tried again to seize him but he escaped from their reach
40  and he went away again across the jordan to the place where john was baptizing at first and he stayed there
41  and many people came to him and began saying john did not perform a single sign but all the things john said about this man were true
42  and many put faith in him there
4  when the lord became aware that the pharisees had heard that jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than john
2  although jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did
3  he left judeʹa and departed again for galʹilee
4  but it was necessary for him to go through samarʹia
5  so he came to a city of samarʹia called syʹchar near the field that jacob had given to his son joseph
6  in fact jacobs well was there
now jesus tired out as he was from the journey was sitting at the well
it was about the sixth hour
7  a woman of samarʹia came to draw water
jesus said to her give me a drink
8  for his disciples had gone off into the city to buy food
9  so the samarʹitan woman said to him how is it that you despite being a jew ask me for a drink even though i am a samarʹitan woman for jews have no dealings with samarʹitans
10  in answer jesus said to her if you had known of the free gift of god and who it is who says to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
11  she said to him sir you do not even have a bucket for drawing water and the well is deep
from what source then do you have this living water
12  you are not greater than our forefather jacob who gave us the well and who together with his sons and his cattle drank out of it are you
13  in answer jesus said to her everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again
14  whoever drinks from the water that i will give him will never get thirsty at all but the water that i will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life
15  the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water
16  he said to her go call your husband and come to this place
17  the woman replied i do not have a husband
jesus said to her you are right in saying i do not have a husband
18  for you have had five husbands and the man you now have is not your husband
this you have said truthfully
19  the woman said to him sir i see that you are a prophet
20  our forefathers worshipped on this mountain but you people say that in jerusalem is the place where people must worship
21  jesus said to her believe me woman the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem will you worship the father
22  you worship what you do not know we worship what we know because salvation begins with the jews
23  nevertheless the hour is coming and it is now when the true worshippers will worship the father with spirit and truth for indeed the father is looking for ones like these to worship him
24  god is a spirit and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth
25  the woman said to him i know that messiʹah is coming who is called christ
whenever that one comes he will declare all things to us openly
26  jesus said to her i am he the one speaking to you
27  just then his disciples arrived and they were surprised because he was speaking with a woman
of course no one said what are you looking for or why are you talking to her
28  so the woman left her water jar and went off into the city and told the people
29  come and see a man who told me everything i did
could this not perhaps be the christ
30  they left the city and began coming to him
31  meanwhile the disciples were urging him rabbi eat
32  but he said to them i have food to eat that you do not know about
33  so the disciples said to one another no one brought him anything to eat did he
34  jesus said to them my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work
35  do you not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes look i say to you lift up your eyes and view the fields that they are white for harvesting
already
36  the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together
37  for in this respect the saying is true one is the sower and another the reaper
38  i sent you to reap what you did not labor on
others have labored and you have entered into the benefit of their labor
39  many of the samarʹitans from that city put faith in him because of the word of the woman who bore witness saying he told me all the things i did
40  so when the samarʹitans came to him they asked him to stay with them and he stayed there two days
41  as a result many more believed because of what he said
42  and they said to the woman we no longer believe just because of what you said for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world
43  after the two days he left there for galʹilee
44  jesus himself however bore witness that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland
45  so when he arrived in galʹilee the galileʹans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he did in jerusalem at the festival for they too had gone to the festival
46  then he came again to caʹna of galʹilee where he had turned the water into wine
now there was a royal official whose son was sick in caperʹnaum
47  when this man heard that jesus had come out of judeʹa into galʹilee he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of dying
48  but jesus said to him unless you people see signs and wonders you will never believe
49  the royal official said to him lord come down before my young child dies
50  jesus said to him go your way your son lives
the man believed the word that jesus spoke to him and he left
51  but while he was on his way down his slaves met him to say that his boy was alive
52  so he asked them at what hour he got better
they replied to him the fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour
53  the father then knew that it was in the very hour that jesus had said to him your son lives
so he and his whole household believed
54  this was the second sign jesus performed when he came from judeʹa into galʹilee
11  now a man named lazʹarus was sick he was from bethʹany the village of mary and her sister martha
2  this was the mary who poured perfumed oil on the lord and wiped his feet dry with her hair it was her brother lazʹarus who was sick
3  so his sisters sent a message to him saying lord see the one you have affection for is sick
4  but when jesus heard it he said this sickness is not meant to end in death but is for the glory of god so that the son of god may be glorified through it
5  now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazʹarus
6  however when he heard that lazʹarus was sick he actually remained in the place where he was for two more days
7  then after this he said to the disciples let us go into judeʹa again
8  the disciples said to him rabbi just lately the judeʹans were seeking to stone you and are you going there again
9  jesus answered there are 12 hours of daylight are there not if anyone walks in daylight he does not stumble into anything because he sees the light of this world
10  but if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him
11  after he said these things he added lazʹarus our friend has fallen asleep but i am traveling there to awaken him
12  the disciples then said to him lord if he is sleeping he will get well
13  jesus however had spoken about his death
but they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep
14  then jesus said to them plainly lazʹarus has died
15  and i rejoice for your sake that i was not there so that you may believe
but let us go to him
16  so thomas who was called the twin said to his fellow disciples let us also go so that we may die with him
17  when jesus arrived he found that lazʹarus had already been in the tomb for four days
18  now bethʹany was near jerusalem about two miles away
19  and many of the jews had come to martha and mary to console them concerning their brother
20  when martha heard that jesus was coming she went to meet him but mary kept sitting at home
21  martha then said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
22  yet even now i know that whatever you ask god for god will give you
23  jesus said to her your brother will rise
24  martha said to him i know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day
25  jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life
the one who exercises faith in me even though he dies will come to life
26  and everyone who is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all
do you believe this
27  she said to him yes lord i have believed that you are the christ the son of god the one coming into the world
28  when she had said this she went off and called mary her sister saying privately the teacher is here and is calling you
29  on hearing this she got up quickly and went to him
30  jesus had not yet come into the village but he was still in the place where martha had met him
31  when the jews who were with mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out they followed her supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there
32  when mary arrived where jesus was and caught sight of him she fell at his feet and said to him lord if you had been here my brother would not have died
33  when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who had come with her weeping he groaned within himself and became troubled
34  he said where have you laid him they said to him lord come and see
35  jesus gave way to tears
36  at that the jews began to say see what affection he had for him
37  but some of them said could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind man prevent this one from dying
38  then jesus after groaning again within himself came to the tomb
it was in fact a cave and a stone was lying against it
39  jesus said take the stone away
martha the sister of the deceased said to him lord by now he must smell for it has been four days
40  jesus said to her did i not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of god
41  so they took the stone away
then jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said father i thank you that you have heard me
42  true i knew that you always hear me but i spoke on account of the crowd standing around so that they may believe that you sent me
43  when he had said these things he cried out with a loud voice lazʹarus come out
44  the man who had been dead came out with his feet and hands bound with wrappings and his face was wrapped with a cloth
jesus said to them free him and let him go
45  therefore many of the jews who had come to mary and who saw what he did put faith in him
46  but some of them went off to the pharisees and told them what jesus had done
47  so the chief priests and the pharisees gathered the sanʹhedrin together and said what are we to do for this man performs many signs
48  if we let him go on this way they will all put faith in him and the romans will come and take away both our place and our nation
49  but one of them caʹiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you do not know anything at all
50  and you have not reasoned that it is to your benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people rather than for the whole nation to be destroyed
51  he did not say this however of his own originality but because he was high priest that year he prophesied that jesus was to die for the nation
52  and not only for the nation but also to gather together into one the children of god who were scattered about
53  so from that day on they conspired to kill him
54  therefore jesus no longer walked about publicly among the jews but he departed from there to the region near the wilderness to a city called eʹphraim and he stayed there with the disciples
55  now the passover of the jews was near and many people from the countryside went up to jerusalem before the passover to cleanse themselves ceremonially
56  they were looking for jesus and they were saying to one another as they stood around in the temple what is your opinion that he will not come to the festival at all
57  but the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that if anyone got to know where jesus was he should report it so that they could seize him
8  12  then jesus spoke again to them saying i am the light of the world
whoever follows me will by no means walk in darkness but will possess the light of life
13  so the pharisees said to him you bear witness about yourself your witness is not true
14  in answer jesus said to them even if i do bear witness about myself my witness is true because i know where i came from and where i am going
but you do not know where i came from and where i am going
15  you judge according to the flesh i do not judge any man at all
16  and yet even if i do judge my judgment is truthful because i am not alone but the father who sent me is with me
17  also in your own law it is written the witness of two men is true
18  i am one who bears witness about myself and the father who sent me bears witness about me
19  then they said to him where is your father jesus answered you know neither me nor my father
if you did know me you would know my father also
20  he spoke these words in the treasury as he was teaching in the temple
but no one seized him for his hour had not yet come
21  so he said to them again i am going away and you will look for me and yet you will die in your sin
where i am going you cannot come
22  the jews then began to say he will not kill himself will he because he says where i am going you cannot come
23  he went on to say to them you are from the realms below i am from the realms above
you are from this world i am not from this world
24  that is why i said to you you will die in your sins
for if you do not believe that i am the one you will die in your sins
25  so they began to say to him who are you jesus replied to them why am i even speaking to you at all
26  i have many things to speak concerning you and to pass judgment on
as a matter of fact the one who sent me is true and the very things i heard from him i am speaking in the world
27  they did not grasp that he was talking to them about the father
28  jesus then said after you have lifted up the son of man then you will know that i am he and that i do nothing of my own initiative but just as the father taught me i speak these things
29  and the one who sent me is with me he did not abandon me to myself because i always do the things pleasing to him
30  as he was saying these things many put faith in him
31  then jesus went on to say to the jews who had believed him if you remain in my word you are really my disciples
32  and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
33  they replied to him we are abrahams offspring and never have been slaves to anyone
how is it you say you will become free
34  jesus answered them most truly i say to you every doer of sin is a slave of sin
35  moreover the slave does not remain in the household forever the son remains forever
36  so if the son sets you free you will be truly free
37  i know that you are abrahams offspring
but you are seeking to kill me because my word makes no progress among you
38  i speak the things i have seen while with my father but you do the things you have heard from your father
39  in answer they said to him our father is abraham
jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would be doing the works of abraham
40  but now you are seeking to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god
abraham did not do this
41  you are doing the works of your father
they said to him we were not born from immorality we have one father god
42  jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and i am here
i have not come of my own initiative but that one sent me
43  why do you not understand what i am saying because you cannot listen to my word
44  you are from your father the devil and you wish to do the desires of your father
that one was a murderer when he began and he did not stand fast in the truth because truth is not in him
when he speaks the lie he speaks according to his own disposition because he is a liar and the father of the lie
45  because i on the other hand tell you the truth you do not believe me
46  who of you convicts me of sin if i speak truth why is it that you do not believe me
47  the one who is from god listens to the sayings of god
this is why you do not listen because you are not from god
48  in answer the jews said to him are we not right in saying you are a samarʹitan and have a demon
49  jesus answered i do not have a demon but i honor my father and you dishonor me
50  but i am not seeking glory for myself there is one who is seeking and judging
51  most truly i say to you if anyone observes my word he will never see death at all
52  the jews said to him now we do know that you have a demon
abraham died also the prophets but you say if anyone observes my word he will never taste death at all
53  you are not greater than our father abraham who died are you the prophets also died
who do you claim to be
54  jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing
it is my father who glorifies me the one who you say is your god
55  yet you have not known him but i know him
and if i said i do not know him i would be like you a liar
but i do know him and am observing his word
56  abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day and he saw it and rejoiced
57  then the jews said to him you are not yet 50 years old and still you have seen abraham
58  jesus said to them most truly i say to you before abraham came into existence i have been
59  so they picked up stones to throw at him but jesus hid and went out of the temple
16  i have said these things to you so that you may not be stumbled
2  men will expel you from the synagogue
in fact the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think he has offered a sacred service to god
3  but they will do these things because they have not come to know either the father or me
4  nevertheless i have told you these things so that when the hour for them to happen arrives you will remember that i told them to you
i did not tell you these things at first because i was with you
5  but now i am going to the one who sent me yet not one of you asks me where are you going
6  but because i have told you these things grief has filled your hearts
7  nevertheless i am telling you the truth it is for your benefit that i am going away
for if i do not go away the helper will not come to you but if i do go i will send him to you
8  and when that one comes he will give the world convincing evidence concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment
9  first concerning sin because they are not exercising faith in me
10  then concerning righteousness because i am going to the father and you will see me no longer
11  then concerning judgment because the ruler of this world has been judged
12  i still have many things to say to you but you are not able to bear them now
13  however when that one comes the spirit of the truth he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak of his own initiative but what he hears he will speak and he will declare to you the things to come
14  that one will glorify me because he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to you
15  all the things that the father has are mine
that is why i said he receives from what is mine and declares it to you
16  in a little while you will see me no longer and again in a little while you will see me
17  at that some of his disciples said to one another what does he mean by saying to us in a little while you will not see me and again in a little while you will see me and because i am going to the father
18  so they were saying what does he mean by saying a little while we do not know what he is talking about
19  jesus knew they wanted to question him so he said to them are you asking one another this because i said in a little while you will not see me and again in a little while you will see me
20  most truly i say to you you will weep and wail but the world will rejoice you will be grieved but your grief will be turned into joy
21  when a woman is giving birth she has grief because her hour has come but when she has given birth to the child she remembers the tribulation no more because of the joy that a man has been born into the world
22  so you also now you have grief but i will see you again and your hearts will rejoice and no one will take away your joy
23  in that day you will ask me no question at all
most truly i say to you if you ask the father for anything he will give it to you in my name
24  until now you have not asked for a single thing in my name
ask and you will receive so that your joy may be complete
25  i have spoken these things to you in comparisons
the hour is coming when i will no longer speak to you in comparisons but i will tell you plainly about the father
26  in that day you will make request of the father in my name in saying this i do not mean that i will make request for you
27  for the father himself has affection for you because you have had affection for me and have believed that i came as gods representative
28  i came as the fathers representative and have come into the world
now i am leaving the world and am going to the father
29  his disciples said see now you are speaking plainly and are not using comparisons
30  now we know that you know all things and you do not need to have anyone question you
by this we believe that you came from god
31  jesus answered them do you believe now
32  look the hour is coming indeed it has come when each one of you will be scattered to his own house and you will leave me alone
but i am not alone because the father is with me
33  i have said these things to you so that by means of me you may have peace
in the world you will have tribulation but take courage i have conquered the world
18  after he said these things jesus went out with his disciples across the kidʹron valley to where there was a garden and he and his disciples went into it
2  now judas his betrayer also knew the place because jesus had often met there with his disciples
3  so judas brought the detachment of soldiers and officers of the chief priests and of the pharisees and came there with torches and lamps and weapons
4  then jesus knowing all the things that were going to happen to him stepped forward and said to them whom are you looking for
5  they answered him jesus the nazareneʹ
he said to them i am he
now judas his betrayer was also standing with them
6  however when jesus said to them i am he they drew back and fell to the ground
7  so he asked them again whom are you looking for they said jesus the nazareneʹ
8  jesus answered i told you that i am he
so if you are looking for me let these men go
9  this was to fulfill what he had said of those whom you have given me i have not lost a single one
10  then simon peter who had a sword drew it and struck the slave of the high priest cutting off his right ear
the name of the slave was malchus
11  jesus however said to peter put the sword into its sheath
should i not drink the cup that the father has given me
12  then the soldiers and the military commander and the officers of the jews seized jesus and bound him
13  they led him first to anʹnas for he was the fatherinlaw of caʹiaphas who was high priest that year
14  caʹiaphas was in fact the one who had advised the jews that it was to their benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people
15  now simon peter as well as another disciple was following jesus
that disciple was known to the high priest and he went with jesus into the courtyard of the high priest
16  but peter was standing outside at the door
so the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought peter in
17  the servant girl who was the doorkeeper then said to peter you are not also one of this mans disciples are you he said i am not
18  now the slaves and the officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made because it was cold and they were warming themselves
peter also was standing with them and warming himself
19  so the chief priest questioned jesus about his disciples and about his teaching
20  jesus answered him i have spoken to the world publicly
i always taught in a synagogue and in the temple where all the jews come together and i said nothing in secret
21  why do you question me question those who have heard what i told them
see these know what i said
22  after he said these things one of the officers who was standing by gave jesus a slap in the face and said is that the way you answer the chief priest
23  jesus answered him if i said something wrong bear witness about the wrong but if what i said was right why do you hit me
24  then anʹnas sent him away bound to caʹiaphas the high priest
25  now simon peter was standing there warming himself
then they said to him you are not also one of his disciples are you he denied it and said i am not
26  one of the slaves of the high priest who was a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off said i saw you in the garden with him did i not
27  however peter denied it again and immediately a rooster crowed
28  then they led jesus from caʹiaphas to the governors residence
it was now early in the morning
but they themselves did not enter into the governors residence so that they would not get defiled but could eat the passover
29  so pilate came outside to them and said what accusation do you bring against this man
30  they answered him if this man were not a wrongdoer we would not have handed him over to you
31  so pilate said to them take him yourselves and judge him according to your law
the jews said to him it is not lawful for us to kill anyone
32  this was to fulfill the word that jesus had spoken to indicate what sort of death he was about to die
33  so pilate entered the governors residence again and called jesus and said to him are you the king of the jews
34  jesus answered are you asking this of your own originality or did others tell you about me
35  pilate replied i am not a jew am i your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me
what did you do
36  jesus answered my kingdom is no part of this world
if my kingdom were part of this world my attendants would have fought that i should not be handed over to the jews
but as it is my kingdom is not from this source
37  so pilate said to him well then are you a king jesus answered you yourself are saying that i am a king
for this i have been born and for this i have come into the world that i should bear witness to the truth
everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice
38  pilate said to him what is truth after saying this he went out again to the jews and said to them i find no fault in him
39  moreover you have a custom that i should release a man to you at the passover
so do you want me to release to you the king of the jews
40  again they shouted not this man but barabʹbas now barabʹbas was a robber
17  jesus spoke these things and raising his eyes to heaven he said father the hour has come
glorify your son so that your son may glorify you
2  just as you have given him authority over all flesh so that he may give everlasting life to all those whom you have given to him
3  this means everlasting life their coming to know you the only true god and the one whom you sent jesus christ
4  i have glorified you on the earth having finished the work you have given me to do
5  so now father glorify me at your side with the glory that i had alongside you before the world was
6  i have made your name manifest to the men whom you gave me out of the world
they were yours and you gave them to me and they have observed your word
7  now they have come to know that all the things you gave me are from you
8  because i have given them the sayings that you gave me and they have accepted them and have certainly come to know that i came as your representative and they have believed that you sent me
9  i make request concerning them i make request not concerning the world but concerning those whom you have given me because they are yours
10  and all my things are yours and yours are mine and i have been glorified among them
11  i am no longer in the world but they are in the world and i am coming to you
holy father watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me so that they may be one just as we are one
12  when i was with them i used to watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me and i have protected them and not one of them is destroyed except the son of destruction so that the scripture might be fulfilled
13  but now i am coming to you and i am saying these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves
14  i have given your word to them but the world has hated them because they are no part of the world just as i am no part of the world
15  i do not request that you take them out of the world but that you watch over them because of the wicked one
16  they are no part of the world just as i am no part of the world
17  sanctify them by means of the truth your word is truth
18  just as you sent me into the world i also sent them into the world
19  and i am sanctifying myself in their behalf so that they also may be sanctified by means of truth
20  i make request not concerning these only but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word
21  so that they may all be one just as you father are in union with me and i am in union with you that they also may be in union with us so that the world may believe that you sent me
22  i have given them the glory that you have given me in order that they may be one just as we are one
23  i in union with them and you in union with me in order that they may be perfected into one so that the world may know that you sent me and that you loved them just as you loved me
24  father i want those whom you have given me to be with me where i am in order that they may look upon my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the founding of the world
25  righteous father the world has indeed not come to know you but i know you and these have come to know that you sent me
26  i have made your name known to them and will make it known so that the love with which you loved me may be in them and i in union with them
9  as he was passing along he saw a man who had been blind from birth
2  and his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents so that he was born blind
3  jesus answered neither this man sinned nor his parents but it was so that the works of god might be made manifest in his case
4  we must do the works of the one who sent me while it is day the night is coming when no man can work
5  as long as i am in the world i am the worlds light
6  after he said these things he spat on the ground and made a paste with the saliva and he smeared the paste on the mans eyes
7  and said to him go wash in the pool of siloʹam which is translated sent forth
and he went and washed and came back seeing
8  then the neighbors and those who formerly used to see that he was a beggar began to say this is the man who used to sit and beg is it not
9  some were saying this is he
others were saying no but he looks like him
the man kept saying i am he
10  so they asked him how then were your eyes opened
11  he answered the man called jesus made a paste and smeared it on my eyes and said to me go to siloʹam and wash
so i went and washed and gained sight
12  at this they said to him where is that man he said i do not know
13  they led the formerly blind man to the pharisees
14  incidentally the day that jesus made the paste and opened his eyes was the sabbath
15  so this time the pharisees also began asking the man how he gained sight
he said to them he put a paste on my eyes and i washed and i can see
16  some of the pharisees then began to say this is not a man from god for he does not observe the sabbath
others said how can a man who is a sinner perform signs of that sort so there was a division among them
17  and again they said to the blind man what do you say about him since it was your eyes that he opened the man said he is a prophet
18  however the jews did not believe that he had been blind and had gained sight until they called the parents of the man who could now see
19  and they asked them is this your son who you say was born blind how then does he now see
20  his parents answered we know that this is our son and that he was born blind
21  but how it is that he now sees we do not know or who opened his eyes we do not know
ask him
he is of age
he must speak for himself
22  his parents said these things because they were in fear of the jews for the jews had already come to an agreement that if anyone acknowledged him as christ that person should be expelled from the synagogue
23  this is why his parents said he is of age
question him
24  so a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner
25  he answered whether he is a sinner i do not know
one thing i do know that i was blind but now i can see
26  then they said to him what did he do to you how did he open your eyes
27  he answered them i told you already and yet you did not listen
why do you want to hear it again you do not want to become his disciples also do you
28  at this they scornfully told him you are a disciple of that man but we are disciples of moses
29  we know that god has spoken to moses but as for this man we do not know where he is from
30  the man answered them this is certainly amazing that you do not know where he is from and yet he opened my eyes
31  we know that god does not listen to sinners but if anyone is godfearing and does his will he listens to this one
32  from of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind
33  if this man were not from god he could do nothing at all
34  in answer they said to him you were altogether born in sin and yet are you teaching us and they threw him out
35  jesus heard that they had thrown him out and on finding him he said are you putting faith in the son of man
36  the man answered and who is he sir so that i may put faith in him
37  jesus said to him you have seen him and in fact he is the one speaking with you
38  he said i do put faith in him lord
and he did obeisance to him
39  jesus then said for this judgment i came into this world that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind
40  those of the pharisees who were with him heard these things and they said to him we are not blind also are we
41  jesus said to them if you were blind you would have no sin
but now you say we see
your sin remains
7  after this jesus continued traveling about in galʹilee for he did not want to do so in judeʹa because the jews were seeking to kill him
2  however the jewish festival of tabernacles was near
3  so his brothers said to him leave here and go into judeʹa so that your disciples may also see the works you are doing
4  for no one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly
if you are doing these things show yourself to the world
5  his brothers were in fact not exercising faith in him
6  so jesus said to them my time has not yet arrived but your time is always at hand
7  the world has no reason to hate you but it hates me because i bear witness about it that its works are wicked
8  you go up to the festival i am not yet going up to this festival because my time has not yet fully come
9  so after he told them these things he remained in galʹilee
10  but when his brothers had gone up to the festival then he also went up not openly but in secret
11  so the jews began looking for him at the festival and saying where is that man
12  and there was a lot of subdued talk about him among the crowds
some would say he is a good man
others would say he is not
he misleads the crowd
13  of course no one would speak about him publicly because of fear of the jews
14  when the festival was half over jesus went up into the temple and began teaching
15  and the jews were astonished saying how does this man have such a knowledge of the scriptures when he has not studied at the schools
16  jesus in turn answered them and said what i teach is not mine but belongs to him who sent me
17  if anyone desires to do his will he will know whether the teaching is from god or i speak of my own originality
18  whoever speaks of his own originality is seeking his own glory but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him this one is true and there is no unrighteousness in him
19  moses gave you the law did he not but not one of you obeys the law
why are you seeking to kill me
20  the crowd answered you have a demon
who is seeking to kill you
21  in answer jesus said to them one deed i performed and you are all surprised
22  for this reason moses has given you circumcisionnot that it is from moses but it is from the forefathersand you circumcise a man on a sabbath
23  if a man receives circumcision on a sabbath so that the law of moses may not be broken are you violently angry at me because i made a man completely well on a sabbath
24  stop judging by the outward appearance but judge with righteous judgment
25  then some of the inhabitants of jerusalem began to say this is the man they are seeking to kill is it not
26  and yet see he is speaking in public and they say nothing to him
have the rulers come to know for certain that this is the christ
27  on the contrary we know where this man is from yet when the christ comes no one is to know where he is from
28  then as he was teaching in the temple jesus called out you know me and you know where i am from
and i have not come of my own initiative but the one who sent me is real and you do not know him
29  i know him because i am a representative from him and that one sent me
30  so they began seeking to get hold of him but no one laid a hand on him for his hour had not yet come
31  still many of the crowd put faith in him and they were saying when the christ comes he will not perform more signs than this man has done will he
32  the pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him and the chief priests and the pharisees sent officers to seize him
33  jesus then said i will be with you a little while longer before i go to the one who sent me
34  you will look for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come
35  therefore the jews said among themselves where does this man intend to go so that we will not find him he does not intend to go to the jews dispersed among the greeks and teach the greeks does he
36  what does he mean when he says you will look for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come
37  on the last day the great day of the festival jesus stood up and he called out if anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink
38  whoever puts faith in me just as the scripture has said from deep within him streams of living water will flow
39  however he said this concerning the spirit which those who put faith in him were about to receive for as yet there was no spirit because jesus had not yet been glorified
40  some in the crowd who heard these words began saying this really is the prophet
41  others were saying this is the christ
but some were saying the christ is not coming out of galʹilee is he
42  does the scripture not say that the christ is coming from the offspring of david and from bethʹlehem the village where david was
43  so a division over him arose among the crowd
44  some of them though wanted to seize him but no one laid his hands on him
45  then the officers went back to the chief priests and pharisees and the latter said to them why did you not bring him in
46  the officers replied never has any man spoken like this
47  in turn the pharisees answered you have not been misled also have you
48  not one of the rulers or of the pharisees has put faith in him has he
49  but this crowd who do not know the law are accursed people
50  nicodeʹmus who had come to him previously and who was one of them said to them
51  our law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and learns what he is doing does it
52  in answer they said to him you are not also out of galʹilee are you search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of galʹilee
6  after this jesus set out across the sea of galʹilee or tibeʹrias
2  and a large crowd kept following him because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing in healing the sick
3  so jesus went up on a mountain and sat down there with his disciples
4  now the passover the festival of the jews was near
5  when jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him he said to philip where will we buy bread for these people to eat
6  however he was saying this to test him for he knew what he was about to do
7  philip answered him two hundred denarʹii worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get even a little
8  one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother said to him
9  here is a little boy who has five barley loaves and two small fish
but what are these among so many
10  jesus said have the men sit down
as there was a lot of grass in that place the men sat down there about 5000 in number
11  jesus took the bread and after giving thanks he distributed it to those who were sitting there he did likewise with the small fish and they had as much as they wanted
12  but when they had eaten their fill he said to his disciples gather together the fragments left over so that nothing is wasted
13  so they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves
14  when the people saw the sign he performed they began to say this really is the prophet who was to come into the world
15  then jesus knowing that they were about to come and seize him to make him king withdrew again to the mountain all alone
16  when evening fell his disciples went down to the sea
17  and boarding a boat they set out across the sea for caperʹnaum
by now it had grown dark and jesus had not yet come to them
18  also the sea was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing
19  however when they had rowed about three or four miles they saw jesus walking on the sea and getting near the boat and they became fearful
20  but he said to them it is i do not be afraid
21  then they were willing to take him into the boat and right away the boat arrived at the land to which they had been heading
22  the next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except a small one and that jesus had not boarded the boat with his disciples but his disciples had left by themselves
23  boats from tibeʹrias however arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the lord had given thanks
24  so when the crowd saw that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they boarded their boats and came to caperʹnaum to look for jesus
25  when they found him across the sea they said to him rabbi when did you get here
26  jesus answered them most truly i say to you you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied
27  work not for the food that perishes but for the food that remains for everlasting life which the son of man will give you for on this one the father god himself has put his seal of approval
28  so they said to him what must we do to carry out the works of god
29  in answer jesus said to them this is the work of god that you exercise faith in the one whom he sent
30  then they said to him what are you performing as a sign so that we may see it and believe you what work are you doing
31  our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness just as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat
32  jesus then said to them most truly i say to you moses did not give you the bread from heaven but my father gives you the true bread from heaven
33  for the bread of god is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world
34  so they said to him lord always give us this bread
35  jesus said to them i am the bread of life
whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all and whoever exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all
36  but as i said to you you have even seen me and yet do not believe
37  all those whom the father gives me will come to me and i will never drive away the one who comes to me
38  for i have come down from heaven to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me
39  this is the will of him who sent me that i should lose none out of all those whom he has given me but that i should resurrect them on the last day
40  for this is the will of my father that everyone who recognizes the son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life and i will resurrect him on the last day
41  then the jews began to murmur about him because he had said i am the bread that came down from heaven
42  and they began saying is this not jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how does he now say i have come down from heaven
43  in response jesus said to them stop murmuring among yourselves
44  no man can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will resurrect him on the last day
45  it is written in the prophets they will all be taught by jehovah
everyone who has listened to the father and has learned comes to me
46  not that any man has seen the father except the one who is from god this one has seen the father
47  most truly i say to you whoever believes has everlasting life
48  i am the bread of life
49  your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet they died
50  this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone may eat of it and not die
51  i am the living bread that came down from heaven
if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever and for a fact the bread that i will give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world
52  then the jews began to argue with one another saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat
53  so jesus said to them most truly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in yourselves
54  whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and i will resurrect him on the last day
55  for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
56  whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me and i in union with him
57  just as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so also the one who feeds on me will live because of me
58  this is the bread that came down from heaven
it is not as when your forefathers ate and yet died
whoever feeds on this bread will live forever
59  he said these things as he was teaching in a synagogue in caperʹnaum
60  when they heard this many of his disciples said this speech is shocking who can listen to it
61  but jesus knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this said to them does this stumble you
62  what therefore if you should see the son of man ascending to where he was before
63  it is the spirit that is lifegiving the flesh is of no use at all
the sayings that i have spoken to you are spirit and are life
64  but there are some of you who do not believe
for jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe and the one who would betray him
65  he went on to say this is why i have said to you no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the father
66  because of this many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him
67  so jesus said to the twelve you do not want to go also do you
68  simon peter answered him lord whom shall we go away to you have sayings of everlasting life
69  we have believed and have come to know that you are the holy one of god
70  jesus answered them i chose you twelve did i not yet one of you is a slanderer
71  he was in fact speaking of judas the son of simon iscarʹiot for this one was going to betray him although he was one of the twelve
21  after this jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of tibeʹrias
he made the manifestation in this way
2  there were together simon peter thomas who was called the twin nathanʹael from caʹna of galʹilee the sons of zebʹedee and two others of his disciples
3  simon peter said to them i am going fishing
they said to him we are coming with you
they went out and got aboard the boat but during that night they caught nothing
4  however just as day was breaking jesus stood on the beach but the disciples did not realize that it was jesus
5  then jesus said to them children you do not have anything to eat do you they answered no
6  he said to them cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some
so they cast it but they were not able to haul it in because of the large number of fish
7  then the disciple whom jesus loved said to peter it is the lord now simon peter on hearing that it was the lord put on his outer garment for he was naked and plunged into the sea
8  but the other disciples came in the small boat dragging the net full of fish for they were not a long way from land only about 300 feet away
9  when they came ashore they saw there a charcoal fire with fish lying on it and bread
10  jesus said to them bring some of the fish you just now caught
11  so simon peter went on board and hauled the net ashore full of big fish 153 of them
and though there were so many the net did not burst
12  jesus said to them come have your breakfast
not one of the disciples had the courage to ask him who are you because they knew it was the lord
13  jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and the same with the fish
14  this was now the third time that jesus appeared to the disciples after being raised up from the dead
15  when they had finished breakfast jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you love me more than these he replied to him yes lord you know i have affection for you
he said to him feed my lambs
16  again he said to him a second time simon son of john do you love me he replied yes lord you know i have affection for you
he said to him shepherd my little sheep
17  he said to him a third time simon son of john do you have affection for me peter became grieved that he asked him the third time do you have affection for me so he said to him lord you are aware of all things you know that i have affection for you
jesus said to him feed my little sheep
18  most truly i say to you when you were younger you used to clothe yourself and walk about where you wanted
but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and another man will clothe you and carry you where you do not wish
19  he said this to indicate by what sort of death he would glorify god
after he said this he said to him continue following me
20  peter turned around and saw the disciple whom jesus loved following the one who at the evening meal had also leaned back on his chest and said lord who is the one betraying you
21  so when he caught sight of him peter said to jesus lord what about this man
22  jesus said to him if it is my will for him to remain until i come of what concern is that to you you continue following me
23  so the saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die
however jesus did not say to him that he would not die but he said if it is my will for him to remain until i come of what concern is that to you
24  this is the disciple who gives this witness about these things and who wrote these things and we know that his witness is true
25  there are also in fact many other things that jesus did which if ever they were written in full detail i suppose the world itself could not contain the scrolls written
13  now because he knew before the festival of the passover that his hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the father jesus having loved his own who were in the world loved them to the end
2  the evening meal was going on and the devil had already put it into the heart of judas iscarʹiot the son of simon to betray him
3  so jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he came from god and was going to god
4  got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments
and taking a towel he wrapped it around his waist
5  after that he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel that was wrapped around him
6  then he came to simon peter
he said to him lord are you washing my feet
7  jesus answered him what i am doing you do not understand now but you will understand after these things
8  peter said to him you will certainly never wash my feet
jesus answered him unless i wash you you have no share with me
9  simon peter said to him lord wash not only my feet but also my hands and my head
10  jesus said to him whoever has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed but is completely clean
and you men are clean but not all of you
11  for he knew the man who was betraying him
this is why he said not all of you are clean
12  when now he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on he again reclined at the table and said to them do you understand what i have done to you
13  you address me as teacher and lord and you are correct for i am such
14  therefore if i the lord and teacher washed your feet you also should wash the feet of one another
15  for i set the pattern for you that just as i did to you you should also do
16  most truly i say to you a slave is not greater than his master nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him
17  if you know these things happy you are if you do them
18  i am not talking about all of you i know the ones i have chosen
but this was so that the scripture might be fulfilled the one who was eating my bread has lifted his heel against me
19  from this moment on i am telling you before it occurs so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he
20  most truly i say to you whoever receives anyone i send receives me also and whoever receives me receives also the one who sent me
21  after saying these things jesus became troubled in spirit and he bore witness saying most truly i say to you one of you will betray me
22  the disciples began to look at one another being at a loss as to which one he was talking about
23  one of the disciples the one whom jesus loved was reclining close to jesus
24  therefore simon peter nodded to this one and said to him tell us whom he is talking about
25  so the latter leaned back on the chest of jesus and said to him lord who is it
26  jesus answered it is the one to whom i will give the piece of bread that i dip
so after dipping the bread he took it and gave it to judas the son of simon iscarʹiot
27  after judas took the piece of bread then satan entered into him
so jesus said to him what you are doing do it more quickly
28  however none of those reclining at the table knew why he said this to him
29  some in fact were thinking that since judas was holding the money box jesus was telling him buy what we need for the festival or that he should give something to the poor
30  so after he received the piece of bread he went out immediately
and it was night
31  when therefore he had gone out jesus said now the son of man is glorified and god is glorified in connection with him
32  god himself will glorify him and he will glorify him immediately
33  little children i am with you a little longer
you will look for me and just as i said to the jews where i go you cannot come i now say it also to you
34  i am giving you a new commandment that you love one another just as i have loved you you also love one another
35  by this all will know that you are my disciplesif you have love among yourselves
36  simon peter said to him lord where are you going jesus answered where i am going you cannot follow me now but you will follow later
37  peter said to him lord why is it i cannot follow you now i will surrender my life in your behalf
38  jesus answered will you surrender your life in my behalf most truly i say to you a rooster will by no means crow until you have disowned me three times
14  do not let your hearts be troubled
exercise faith in god exercise faith also in me
2  in the house of my father are many dwelling places
otherwise i would have told you for i am going my way to prepare a place for you
3  also if i go my way and prepare a place for you i will come again and will receive you home to myself so that where i am you also may be
4  and where i am going you know the way
5  thomas said to him lord we do not know where you are going
how can we know the way
6  jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life
no one comes to the father except through me
7  if you men had known me you would have known my father also from this moment on you know him and have seen him
8  philip said to him lord show us the father and it is enough for us
9  jesus said to him even after i have been with you men for such a long time philip have you not come to know me whoever has seen me has seen the father also
how is it you say show us the father
10  do you not believe that i am in union with the father and the father is in union with me the things i say to you i do not speak of my own originality but the father who remains in union with me is doing his works
11  believe me that i am in union with the father and the father is in union with me otherwise believe because of the works themselves
12  most truly i say to you whoever exercises faith in me will also do the works that i do and he will do works greater than these because i am going my way to the father
13  also whatever you ask in my name i will do this so that the father may be glorified in connection with the son
14  if you ask anything in my name i will do it
15  if you love me you will observe my commandments
16  and i will ask the father and he will give you another helper to be with you forever
17  the spirit of the truth which the world cannot receive because it neither sees it nor knows it
you know it because it remains with you and is in you
18  i will not leave you bereaved
i am coming to you
19  in a little while the world will see me no more but you will see me because i live and you will live
20  in that day you will know that i am in union with my father and you are in union with me and i am in union with you
21  whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me
in turn whoever loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and will clearly show myself to him
22  judas not iscarʹiot said to him lord what has happened that you intend to show yourself clearly to us and not to the world
23  in answer jesus said to him if anyone loves me he will observe my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him
24  whoever does not love me does not observe my words
the word that you are hearing is not mine but belongs to the father who sent me
25  i have spoken these things to you while i am still with you
26  but the helper the holy spirit which the father will send in my name that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things i told you
27  i leave you peace i give you my peace
i do not give it to you the way that the world gives it
do not let your hearts be troubled nor let them shrink out of fear
28  you heard that i said to you i am going away and i am coming back to you
if you loved me you would rejoice that i am going to the father for the father is greater than i am
29  so now i have told you before it occurs so that you may believe when it does occur
30  i will not speak with you much more for the ruler of the world is coming and he has no hold on me
31  but for the world to know that i love the father i am doing just as the father has commanded me to do
get up let us go from here
19  pilate then took jesus and scourged him
2  and the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and clothed him with a purple robe
3  and they kept coming up to him and saying greetings you king of the jews they also kept slapping him in the face
4  pilate went outside again and said to them see i bring him outside to you in order for you to know that i find no fault in him
5  so jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe
and pilate said to them look the man
6  however when the chief priests and the officers saw him they shouted to the stake with him to the stake with him pilate said to them take him yourselves and execute him for i do not find any fault in him
7  the jews answered him we have a law and according to the law he ought to die because he made himself gods son
8  when pilate heard what they were saying he became even more fearful
9  and he entered the governors residence again and said to jesus where are you from but jesus gave him no answer
10  so pilate said to him are you refusing to speak to me do you not know that i have authority to release you and i have authority to execute you
11  jesus answered him you would have no authority over me at all unless it had been granted to you from above
this is why the man who handed me over to you has greater sin
12  for this reason pilate kept trying to find a way to release him but the jews shouted if you release this man you are not a friend of caesar
everyone who makes himself a king speaks against caesar
13  then pilate after hearing these words brought jesus outside and he sat down on a judgment seat in a place called the stone pavement but in hebrew gabʹbatha
14  now it was the day of preparation of the passover it was about the sixth hour
and he said to the jews see your king
15  however they shouted take him away take him away to the stake with him pilate said to them shall i execute your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar
16  then he handed him over to them to be executed on the stake
so they took charge of jesus
17  bearing the torture stake for himself he went out to the socalled skull place which is called golʹgotha in hebrew
18  there they nailed him to the stake alongside two other men one on each side with jesus in the middle
19  pilate also wrote a title and put it on the torture stake
it was written jesus the nazareneʹ the king of the jews
20  many of the jews read this title because the place where jesus was nailed to the stake was near the city and it was written in hebrew in latin and in greek
21  however the chief priests of the jews said to pilate do not write the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews
22  pilate answered what i have written i have written
23  now when the soldiers had nailed jesus to the stake they took his outer garments and divided them into four parts one for each soldier and they also took the inner garment
but the inner garment was without a seam being woven from top to bottom
24  so they said to one another let us not tear it but let us cast lots over it to decide whose it will be
this was to fulfill the scripture they divided my garments among themselves and they cast lots for my clothing
so the soldiers actually did these things
25  by the torture stake of jesus however there were standing his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of cloʹpas and mary magʹdalene
26  so when jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby he said to his mother woman see your son
27  next he said to the disciple see your mother and from that hour on the disciple took her into his own home
28  after this when jesus knew that by now all things had been accomplished in order to fulfill the scripture he said i am thirsty
29  a jar was sitting there full of sour wine
so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop stalk and held it up to his mouth
30  when he had received the sour wine jesus said it has been accomplished and bowing his head he gave up his spirit
31  since it was the day of preparation so that the bodies would not remain on the torture stakes on the sabbath for that sabbath day was a great one the jews asked pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away
32  so the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and those of the other man who was on a stake alongside him
33  but on coming to jesus they saw that he was already dead so they did not break his legs
34  but one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out
35  and the one who has seen it has given this witness and his witness is true and he knows that what he says is true so that you also may believe
36  in fact these things took place for the scripture to be fulfilled not a bone of his will be broken
37  and again a different scripture says they will look to the one whom they pierced
38  now after these things joseph of arimatheʹa who was a disciple of jesus but a secret one because of his fear of the jews asked pilate if he could take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him permission
so he came and took the body away
39  nicodeʹmus the man who had come to him in the night the first time also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds
40  so they took the body of jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices according to the burial custom of the jews
41  incidentally there was a garden at the place where he was executed and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had ever yet been laid
42  because it was the day of preparation of the jews and the tomb was nearby they laid jesus there
5  after this there was a festival of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem
2  now in jerusalem at the sheep gate is a pool called in hebrew bethzaʹtha with five colonnades
3  within these a multitude of the sick blind lame and those with withered limbs were lying down
4  
5  but one man was there who had been sick for 38 years
6  seeing this man lying there and being aware that he had already been sick for a long time jesus said to him do you want to get well
7  the sick man answered him sir i do not have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up but while i am on my way another steps down ahead of me
8  jesus said to him get up pick up your mat and walk
9  and the man immediately got well and he picked up his mat and began to walk
that day was the sabbath
10  so the jews began to say to the cured man it is the sabbath and it is not lawful for you to carry the mat
11  but he answered them the same one who made me well said to me pick up your mat and walk
12  they asked him who is the man who told you pick it up and walk
13  but the healed man did not know who he was for jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there
14  after this jesus found him in the temple and said to him see you have become well
do not sin anymore so that something worse does not happen to you
15  the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well
16  for this reason the jews were persecuting jesus because he was doing these things during the sabbath
17  but he answered them my father has kept working until now and i keep working
18  this is why the jews began seeking all the more to kill him because not only was he breaking the sabbath but he was also calling god his own father making himself equal to god
19  therefore in response jesus said to them most truly i say to you the son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative but only what he sees the father doing
for whatever things that one does these things the son does also in like manner
20  for the father has affection for the son and shows him all the things he himself does and he will show him works greater than these so that you may marvel
21  for just as the father raises the dead up and makes them alive so the son also makes alive whomever he wants to
22  for the father judges no one at all but he has entrusted all the judging to the son
23  so that all may honor the son just as they honor the father
whoever does not honor the son does not honor the father who sent him
24  most truly i say to you whoever hears my word and believes the one who sent me has everlasting life and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life
25  most truly i say to you the hour is coming and it is now when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who have paid attention will live
26  for just as the father has life in himself so he has granted also to the son to have life in himself
27  and he has given him authority to do judging because he is the son of man
28  do not be amazed at this for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice
29  and come out those who did good things to a resurrection of life and those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment
30  i cannot do a single thing of my own initiative
just as i hear i judge and my judgment is righteous because i seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me
31  if i alone bear witness about myself my witness is not true
32  there is another who bears witness about me and i know that the witness he bears about me is true
33  you have sent men to john and he has borne witness to the truth
34  however i do not accept the witness from man but i say these things so that you may be saved
35  that man was a burning and shining lamp and for a short time you were willing to rejoice greatly in his light
36  but i have the witness greater than that of john for the very works that my father assigned me to accomplish these works that i am doing bear witness that the father sent me
37  and the father who sent me has himself borne witness about me
you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form
38  and you do not have his word residing in you because you do not believe the very one whom he sent
39  you are searching the scriptures because you think that you will have everlasting life by means of them and these are the very ones that bear witness about me
40  and yet you do not want to come to me so that you may have life
41  i do not accept glory from men
42  but i well know that you do not have the love of god in you
43  i have come in the name of my father but you do not receive me
if someone else came in his own name you would receive that one
44  how can you believe when you are accepting glory from one another and you are not seeking the glory that is from the only god
45  do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one who accuses you moses in whom you have put your hope
46  in fact if you believed moses you would believe me for he wrote about me
47  but if you do not believe his writings how will you believe what i say
15  i am the true vine and my father is the cultivator
2  he takes away every branch in me not bearing fruit and he cleans every one bearing fruit so that it may bear more fruit
3  you are already clean because of the word that i have spoken to you
4  remain in union with me and i will remain in union with you
just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine neither can you unless you remain in union with me
5  i am the vine you are the branches
whoever remains in union with me and i in union with him this one bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing at all
6  if anyone does not remain in union with me he is thrown out like a branch and dries up
and men gather those branches and throw them into the fire and they are burned
7  if you remain in union with me and my sayings remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will take place for you
8  my father is glorified in this that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples
9  just as the father has loved me so i have loved you remain in my love
10  if you observe my commandments you will remain in my love just as i have observed the commandments of the father and remain in his love
11  these things i have spoken to you so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full
12  this is my commandment that you love one another just as i have loved you
13  no one has love greater than this that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends
14  you are my friends if you do what i am commanding you
15  i no longer call you slaves because a slave does not know what his master does
but i have called you friends because i have made known to you all the things i have heard from my father
16  you did not choose me but i chose you and i appointed you to go and keep bearing fruit and that your fruit should remain so that no matter what you ask the father in my name he may give it to you
17  these things i command you that you love one another
18  if the world hates you you know that it has hated me before it hated you
19  if you were part of the world the world would be fond of what is its own
now because you are no part of the world but i have chosen you out of the world for this reason the world hates you
20  keep in mind the word i said to you a slave is not greater than his master
if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have observed my word they will also observe yours
21  but they will do all these things against you on account of my name because they do not know the one who sent me
22  if i had not come and spoken to them they would have no sin
but now they have no excuse for their sin
23  whoever hates me also hates my father
24  if i had not done among them the works that no one else did they would have no sin but now they have both seen me and hated me as well as my father
25  but this happened in order to fulfill the word written in their law they hated me without cause
26  when the helper comes that i will send you from the father the spirit of the truth which comes from the father that one will bear witness about me
27  and you in turn are to bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning
20  on the first day of the week mary magʹdalene came to the tomb early while it was still dark and she saw that the stone had already been taken away from the tomb
2  so she came running to simon peter and to the other disciple for whom jesus had affection and she said to them they have taken away the lord out of the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him
3  then peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb
4  the two of them began running together but the other disciple ran faster than peter and reached the tomb first
5  stooping forward he saw the linen cloths lying there but he did not go in
6  then simon peter also came following him and he went into the tomb
and he saw the linen cloths lying there
7  the cloth that had been on his head was not lying with the other cloth bands but was rolled up in a place by itself
8  then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed
9  for they did not yet understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead
10  so the disciples went back to their homes
11  mary however kept standing outside near the tomb weeping
while she was weeping she stooped forward to look into the tomb
12  and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of jesus had been lying one at the head and one at the feet
13  and they said to her woman why are you weeping she said to them they have taken my lord away and i do not know where they have laid him
14  after saying this she turned around and saw jesus standing there but she did not realize that it was jesus
15  jesus said to her woman why are you weeping whom are you looking for she thinking it was the gardener said to him sir if you have carried him off tell me where you have laid him and i will take him away
16  jesus said to her mary on turning around she said to him in hebrew rabboʹni which means teacher
17  jesus said to her stop clinging to me for i have not yet ascended to the father
but go to my brothers and say to them i am ascending to my father and your father and to my god and your god
18  mary magʹdalene came and brought the news to the disciples i have seen the lord and she told them what he had said to her
19  when it was late that day the first day of the week and the doors were locked where the disciples were for fear of the jews jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them may you have peace
20  after saying this he showed them his hands and his side
then the disciples rejoiced at seeing the lord
21  jesus said to them again may you have peace
just as the father has sent me i also am sending you
22  after saying this he blew on them and said to them receive holy spirit
23  if you forgive the sins of anyone they are forgiven if you retain those of anyone they are retained
24  but thomas one of the twelve who was called the twin was not with them when jesus came
25  so the other disciples were telling him we have seen the lord but he said to them unless i see in his hands the print of the nails and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side i will never believe it
26  well eight days later his disciples were again indoors and thomas was with them
jesus came although the doors were locked and he stood in their midst and said may you have peace
27  next he said to thomas put your finger here and see my hands and take your hand and stick it into my side and stop doubting but believe
28  in answer thomas said to him my lord and my god
29  jesus said to him because you have seen me have you believed happy are those who have not seen and yet believe
30  to be sure jesus also performed many other signs before the disciples which are not written down in this scroll
31  but these have been written down so that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and because of believing you may have life by means of his name
1  in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was a god
2  this one was in the beginning with god
3  all things came into existence through him and apart from him not even one thing came into existence
what has come into existence
4  by means of him was life and the life was the light of men
5  and the light is shining in the darkness but the darkness has not overpowered it
6  there came a man who was sent as a representative of god his name was john
7  this man came as a witness in order to bear witness about the light so that people of all sorts might believe through him
8  he was not that light but he was meant to bear witness about that light
9  the true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world
10  he was in the world and the world came into existence through him but the world did not know him
11  he came to his own home but his own people did not accept him
12  however to all who did receive him he gave authority to become gods children because they were exercising faith in his name
13  and they were born not from blood or from a fleshly will or from mans will but from god
14  so the word became flesh and resided among us and we had a view of his glory a glory such as belongs to an onlybegotten son from a father and he was full of divine favor and truth
15  john bore witness about him yes he cried out this was the one of whom i said the one coming behind me has advanced in front of me for he existed before me
16  for we all received from his fullness even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness
17  because the law was given through moses the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through jesus christ
18  no man has seen god at any time the onlybegotten god who is at the fathers side is the one who has explained him
19  this is the witness john gave when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who are you
20  and he admitted it and did not deny it saying i am not the christ
21  and they asked him what then are you eliʹjah he replied i am not
are you the prophet and he answered no
22  so they said to him who are you tell us so that we may give an answer to those who sent us
what do you say about yourself
23  he said i am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness make the way of jehovah straight just as isaiah the prophet said
24  now those sent were from the pharisees
25  so they questioned him and said to him why then do you baptize if you are not the christ or eliʹjah or the prophet
26  john answered them i baptize in water
one is standing among you whom you do not know
27  the one coming behind me the lace of whose sandal i am not worthy to untie
28  these things took place in bethʹany across the jordan where john was baptizing
29  the next day he saw jesus coming toward him and he said see the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world
30  this is the one about whom i said behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me for he existed before me
31  even i did not know him but the reason why i came baptizing in water was so that he might be made manifest to israel
32  john also bore witness saying i viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven and it remained upon him
33  even i did not know him but the very one who sent me to baptize in water said to me whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining this is the one who baptizes in holy spirit
34  and i have seen it and i have given witness that this one is the son of god
35  again the next day john was standing with two of his disciples
36  and as he looked at jesus walking he said see the lamb of god
37  when the two disciples heard him say this they followed jesus
38  then jesus turned and seeing them following he said to them what are you looking for they said to him rabbi which means when translated teacher where are you staying
39  he said to them come and you will see
so they went and saw where he was staying and they stayed with him that day it was about the tenth hour
40  andrew the brother of simon peter was one of the two who heard what john said and followed jesus
41  he first found his own brother simon and said to him we have found the messiʹah which means when translated christ
42  and he led him to jesus
when jesus looked at him he said you are simon the son of john you will be called ceʹphas which is translated peter
43  the next day he wanted to leave for galʹilee
jesus then found philip and said to him be my follower
44  now philip was from bethsaʹida from the city of andrew and peter
45  philip found nathanʹael and said to him we have found the one of whom moses in the law and the prophets wrote jesus the son of joseph from nazʹareth
46  but nathanʹael said to him can anything good come out of nazʹareth philip said to him come and see
47  jesus saw nathanʹael coming toward him and said about him see truly an israelite in whom there is no deceit
48  nathanʹael said to him how do you know me jesus answered him before philip called you while you were under the fig tree i saw you
49  nathanʹael responded rabbi you are the son of god you are king of israel
50  jesus answered him do you believe because i told you i saw you under the fig tree you will see things greater than these
51  he then said to him most truly i say to you men you will see heaven opened up and the angels of god ascending and descending to the son of man
2  and on the third day a marriage feast took place in caʹna of galʹilee and the mother of jesus was there
2  jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast
3  when the wine ran short the mother of jesus said to him they have no wine
4  but jesus said to her woman why is that of concern to me and to you my hour has not yet come
5  his mother said to those serving do whatever he tells you
6  now there were six stone water jars sitting there as required by the purification rules of the jews each able to hold two or three liquid measures
7  jesus said to them fill the jars with water
so they filled them to the brim
8  then he said to them now draw some out and take it to the director of the feast
so they took it
9  when the director of the feast tasted the water that had now been turned into wine not knowing where it came from although the servants who had drawn out the water knew the director of the feast called the bridegroom
10  and said to him everyone else puts out the fine wine first and when people are intoxicated the inferior
you have saved the fine wine until now
11  jesus did this in caʹna of galʹilee as the beginning of his signs and he made his glory manifest and his disciples put their faith in him
12  after this he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples went down to caperʹnaum but they did not stay there many days
13  now the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem
14  he found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves and the money brokers in their seats
15  so after making a whip of ropes he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables
16  and he said to those selling the doves take these things away from here stop making the house of my father a house of commerce
17  his disciples recalled that it is written the zeal for your house will consume me
18  therefore in response the jews said to him what sign can you show us since you are doing these things
19  jesus replied to them tear down this temple and in three days i will raise it up
20  the jews then said this temple was built in 46 years and will you raise it up in three days
21  but he was talking about the temple of his body
22  when though he was raised up from the dead his disciples recalled that he used to say this and they believed the scripture and what jesus had spoken
23  however when he was in jerusalem at the festival of the passover many people put their faith in his name when they saw the signs that he was performing
24  but jesus would not entrust himself to them because he knew them all
25  and because he did not need to have anyone bear witness about man for he knew what was in man
3  there was a man of the pharisees named nicodeʹmus a ruler of the jews
2  this one came to him in the night and said to him rabbi we know that you have come from god as a teacher for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless god is with him
3  in response jesus said to him most truly i say to you unless anyone is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
4  nicodeʹmus said to him how can a man be born when he is old he cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born can he
5  jesus answered most truly i say to you unless anyone is born from water and spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
6  what has been born from the flesh is flesh and what has been born from the spirit is spirit
7  do not be amazed because i told you you people must be born again
8  the wind blows where it wants to and you hear the sound of it but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going
so it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit
9  in answer nicodeʹmus said to him how can these things be
10  jesus replied are you a teacher of israel and yet do not know these things
11  most truly i say to you what we know we speak and what we have seen we bear witness to but you do not receive the witness we give
12  if i have told you earthly things and you still do not believe how will you believe if i tell you heavenly things
13  moreover no man has ascended into heaven but the one who descended from heaven the son of man
14  and just as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so the son of man must be lifted up
15  so that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life
16  for god loved the world so much that he gave his onlybegotten son so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life
17  for god did not send his son into the world for him to judge the world but for the world to be saved through him
18  whoever exercises faith in him is not to be judged
whoever does not exercise faith has been judged already because he has not exercised faith in the name of the onlybegotten son of god
19  now this is the basis for judgment that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were wicked
20  for whoever practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light so that his works may not be reproved
21  but whoever does what is true comes to the light so that his works may be made manifest as having been done in harmony with god
22  after this jesus and his disciples went into the judeʹan countryside and there he spent some time with them and was baptizing
23  but john too was baptizing in aeʹnon near saʹlim because there was a great quantity of water there and people kept coming and were being baptized
24  for john had not yet been thrown into prison
25  now the disciples of john had a dispute with a jew concerning purification
26  so they came to john and said to him rabbi the man who was with you across the jordan about whom you bore witness see this one is baptizing and all are going to him
27  in answer john said a man cannot receive a single thing unless it has been given him from heaven
28  you yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but i have been sent ahead of that one
29  whoever has the bride is the bridegroom
but the friend of the bridegroom when he stands and hears him has a great deal of joy on account of the voice of the bridegroom
so my joy has been made complete
30  that one must keep on increasing but i must keep on decreasing
31  the one who comes from above is over all others
the one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks of things of the earth
the one who comes from heaven is over all others
32  he bears witness to what he has seen and heard but no man accepts his witness
33  whoever has accepted his witness has put his seal to it that god is true
34  for the one whom god sent speaks the sayings of god for he does not give the spirit sparingly
35  the father loves the son and has given all things into his hand
36  the one who exercises faith in the son has everlasting life the one who disobeys the son will not see life but the wrath of god remains upon him
12  six days before the passover jesus arrived at bethʹany where lazʹarus was whom jesus had raised up from the dead
2  so they spread an evening meal for him there and martha was serving them but lazʹarus was one of those dining with him
3  then mary took a pound of perfumed oil genuine nard very costly and she poured it on the feet of jesus and wiped his feet dry with her hair
the house became filled with the scent of the perfumed oil
4  but judas iscarʹiot one of his disciples who was about to betray him said
5  why was this perfumed oil not sold for 300 denarʹii and given to the poor
6  he said this though not because he was concerned about the poor but because he was a thief and had the money box and used to steal the money put in it
7  then jesus said let her alone so that she may keep this observance in view of the day of my burial
8  for you always have the poor with you but you will not always have me
9  meanwhile a large crowd of jews got to know that he was there and they came not only because of jesus but also to see lazʹarus whom he had raised up from the dead
10  the chief priests now conspired to kill lazʹarus also
11  since it was because of him that many of the jews were going there and putting faith in jesus
12  the next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem
13  so they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him and they began to shout save we pray you blessed is the one who comes in jehovahs name the king of israel
14  when jesus found a young donkey he sat on it just as it is written
15  have no fear daughter of zion
look your king is coming seated on a donkeys colt
16  these things his disciples did not understand at first but when jesus was glorified they recalled that these things were written about him and that they did these things to him
17  now the crowd that was with him when he called lazʹarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead kept bearing witness
18  this is also why the crowd went to meet him because they heard he had performed this sign
19  so the pharisees said among themselves you see that you are not getting anywhere
look the whole world has gone after him
20  now there were some greeks among those who had come to worship at the festival
21  so these approached philip who was from bethsaʹida of galʹilee and they began to request him saying sir we want to see jesus
22  philip came and told andrew
andrew and philip came and told jesus
23  but jesus answered them the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified
24  most truly i say to you unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies it remains just one grain but if it dies it then bears much fruit
25  whoever is fond of his life destroys it but whoever hates his life in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life
26  if anyone would minister to me let him follow me and where i am there my minister will be also
if anyone would minister to me the father will honor him
27  now i am troubled and what should i say father save me out of this hour
nevertheless this is why i have come to this hour
28  father glorify your name
then a voice came out of heaven i have glorified it and will glorify it again
29  the crowd that was standing there heard it and began to say that it had thundered
others said an angel has spoken to him
30  jesus answered this voice has occurred not for my sake but for your sakes
31  now there is a judging of this world now the ruler of this world will be cast out
32  and yet i if i am lifted up from the earth will draw all sorts of men to myself
33  this he was really saying to indicate what sort of death he was about to die
34  then the crowd answered him we heard from the law that the christ remains forever
how can you say that the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man
35  so jesus said to them the light will be among you a little while longer
walk while you still have the light so that darkness does not overpower you whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going
36  while you have the light exercise faith in the light so that you may become sons of light
jesus said these things and went off and hid from them
37  although he had performed so many signs before them they were not putting faith in him
38  so that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled who said jehovah who has put faith in the thing heard from us and as for the arm of jehovah to whom has it been revealed
39  the reason why they were not able to believe is that again isaiah said
40  he has blinded their eyes and has made their hearts hard so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn around and i heal them
41  isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and he spoke about him
42  all the same many even of the rulers actually put faith in him but they would not acknowledge him because of the pharisees so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue
43  for they loved the glory of men even more than the glory of god
44  however jesus called out and said whoever puts faith in me puts faith not only in me but also in him who sent me
45  and whoever sees me sees also the one who sent me
46  i have come as a light into the world so that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness
47  but if anyone hears my sayings and does not keep them i do not judge him for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
48  whoever disregards me and does not receive my sayings has one to judge him
the word that i have spoken is what will judge him on the last day
49  for i have not spoken of my own initiative but the father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak
50  and i know that his commandment means everlasting life
so whatever i speak i speak just as the father has told me
