10  as soon as king adoʹnizeʹdek of jerusalem heard that joshua had captured aʹi and devoted it to destruction doing to aʹi and its king just as he had done to jerʹicho and its king and how the inhabitants of gibʹeon had made peace with israel and remained among them
2  he was greatly alarmed because gibʹeon was a great city like one of the royal cities
it was greater than aʹi and all its men were warriors
3  so adoʹnizeʹdek king of jerusalem sent this message to hoʹham king of hebʹron piʹram king of jarʹmuth japhiʹa king of laʹchish and deʹbir king of egʹlon
4  come to my aid and let us attack gibʹeon because it has made peace with joshua and the israelites
5  at this the five kings of the amʹoritesthe king of jerusalem the king of hebʹron the king of jarʹmuth the king of laʹchish and the king of egʹlongathered together along with their armies and they marched on and encamped against gibʹeon to fight against it
6  then the men of gibʹeon sent word to joshua at the camp at gilʹgal do not forsake your slaves
come quickly rescue us and help us all the kings of the amʹorites from the mountainous region have gathered against us
7  so joshua went up from gilʹgal with all the fighting men and the mighty warriors
8  jehovah then said to joshua do not be afraid of them for i have handed them over to you
not one of them will be able to stand against you
9  joshua came against them by surprise after marching all night long from gilʹgal
10  jehovah threw them into confusion before israel and they inflicted a great slaughter on them at gibʹeon pursuing them by way of the ascent of bethhoʹron and striking them down as far as azeʹkah and makkeʹdah
11  while they were fleeing from israel and were on the descent of bethhoʹron jehovah hurled great hailstones from the sky on them as far as azeʹkah and they perished
in fact more died from the hail than from the sword of the israelites
12  it was then on the day that jehovah routed the amʹorites before the eyes of the israelites that joshua said to jehovah before israel sun stand still over gibʹeonand moon over the valley of aiʹjalon
13  so the sun stood still and the moon did not move until the nation could take vengeance on its enemies
is it not written in the book of jaʹshar the sun stood still in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to set for about a whole day
14  there has never been a day like that one either before it or after it when jehovah listened to the voice of a man for jehovah was fighting for israel
15  after that joshua together with all israel returned to the camp at gilʹgal
16  meanwhile the five kings fled and hid in the cave at makkeʹdah
17  then it was reported to joshua the five kings have been found hiding in the cave at makkeʹdah
18  so joshua said roll large stones over the mouth of the cave and assign men to guard them
19  but the rest of you should not stop
pursue your enemies and strike them from the rear
do not allow them to enter into their cities for jehovah your god has given them into your hands
20  after joshua and the israelites had finished inflicting a very great slaughter on them to the point of wiping them out except for some survivors who escaped and entered into the fortified cities
21  all the people returned safely to joshua at the camp at makkeʹdah
not a man dared to utter a word against the israelites
22  then joshua said open the mouth of the cave and bring the five kings out of the cave to me
23  so they brought to him from the cave these five kings the king of jerusalem the king of hebʹron the king of jarʹmuth the king of laʹchish and the king of egʹlon
24  when they brought these kings to joshua he summoned all the men of israel and said to the commanders of the fighting men who had gone with him come forward
place your feet on the backs of the necks of these kings
so they came forward and placed their feet on the backs of their necks
25  then joshua said to them do not be afraid or be terrified
be courageous and strong for this is what jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you are fighting
26  then joshua struck them and put them to death and hung them on five stakes and they remained hanging on the stakes until the evening
27  at sunset joshua ordered that they be taken down off the stakes and thrown into the cave where they had hidden themselves
then large stones were placed at the mouth of the cave and these remain to this very day
28  joshua captured makkeʹdah on that day and struck it with the sword
he devoted its king and everyone in it to destruction letting no survivor remain
he did to the king of makkeʹdah just as he had done to the king of jerʹicho
29  then joshua together with all israel went from makkeʹdah to libʹnah and fought against libʹnah
30  jehovah also gave it and its king into israels hand and they struck it and everyone in it with the sword not letting a survivor remain in it
so they did to its king just as they had done to the king of jerʹicho
31  next joshua together with all israel went from libʹnah to laʹchish and camped there and fought against it
32  jehovah gave laʹchish into israels hand and they captured it on the second day
they struck it and everyone in it with the sword just as they had done to libʹnah
33  then hoʹram king of geʹzer went up to help laʹchish but joshua struck him and his people down until not one survivor remained
34  then joshua together with all israel went from laʹchish to egʹlon and camped there and fought against it
35  they captured it on that day and struck it with the sword
they devoted everyone in it to destruction on that day just as they had done to laʹchish
36  then joshua together with all israel went up from egʹlon to hebʹron and fought against it
37  they captured it and struck it its king its towns and everyone in it with the sword not letting any survivor remain
just as he had done to egʹlon he devoted it and everyone in it to destruction
38  finally joshua together with all israel turned toward deʹbir and fought against it
39  he captured it its king and all its towns and they struck them down with the sword devoting everyone in it to destruction not letting any survivor remain
he did to deʹbir and its king just as he had done to hebʹron and to libʹnah and its king
40  joshua conquered all the land of the mountainous region the negʹeb the shepheʹlah and the slopes and all their kings not letting any survivor remain he devoted everything that breathed to destruction just as jehovah the god of israel had commanded
41  joshua conquered them from kaʹdeshbarʹnea to gazʹa and all the land of goʹshen and up to gibʹeon
42  joshua captured all these kings and their land all at the same time because it was jehovah the god of israel who was fighting for israel
43  then joshua returned with all israel to the camp at gilʹgal
4  as soon as the whole nation had finished crossing the jordan jehovah said to joshua
2  take 12 men from the people one man from each tribe
3  and give them this command take up 12 stones from the middle of the jordan from the place where the priests feet stood still and carry them over with you and set them down in the place where you will spend the night
4  so joshua called the 12 men whom he had appointed from the israelites one man from each tribe
5  and joshua said to them pass ahead of the ark of jehovah your god to the middle of the jordan and each of you should lift up a stone on his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the israelites
6  to serve as a sign among you
if your children should later ask you why do you have these stones
7  you must tell them because the waters of the jordan were halted from before the ark of jehovahs covenant
when it crossed the jordan the waters of the jordan were halted
these stones will serve as a lasting memorial to the people of israel
8  so the israelites did just as joshua had commanded
they took up 12 stones from the middle of the jordan just as jehovah had instructed joshua to correspond to the number of the tribes of the israelites
they took them over to the place where they would spend the night and set them down there
9  joshua also set up 12 stones in the middle of the jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood and the stones are there to this day
10  the priests carrying the ark remained standing in the middle of the jordan until everything that jehovah had ordered joshua to tell the people to do was completed in harmony with all that moses had commanded joshua
all the while the people hurried across
11  as soon as all the people had finished crossing over the ark of jehovah and the priests crossed over in the sight of the people
12  and the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh crossed over in battle formation ahead of the other israelites just as moses had instructed them
13  about 40000 soldiers armed for battle crossed over before jehovah onto the desert plains of jerʹicho
14  on that day jehovah exalted joshua in the eyes of all israel and they deeply respected him all the days of his life just as they had deeply respected moses
15  then jehovah said to joshua
16  command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony to come up out of the jordan
17  so joshua commanded the priests come up out of the jordan
18  when the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of jehovah came up from the middle of the jordan and the soles of the feet of the priests stepped onto dry ground the waters of the jordan resumed their course and overflowed the banks as before
19  the people came up from the jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at gilʹgal on the eastern border of jerʹicho
20  as for the 12 stones that they had taken out of the jordan joshua set these up at gilʹgal
21  then he said to the israelites in the future when your children ask their fathers what do these stones mean
22  you must explain to your children israel crossed the jordan on dry land
23  when jehovah your god dried up the waters of the jordan before them until they had crossed it just as jehovah your god did to the red sea when he dried it up before us until we crossed it
24  he did this so that all the peoples of the earth may know how mighty jehovahs hand is and so that you may always fear jehovah your god
11  as soon as jaʹbin king of haʹzor heard of it he sent word to joʹbab king of maʹdon and to the king of shimʹron the king of achʹshaph
2  the kings who were in the northern mountainous region those in the plains south of chinʹnereth those in the shepheʹlah and on the slopes of dor to the west
3  the caʹnaanites to the east and the west the amʹorites the hitʹtites the perʹizzites the jebʹusites in the mountainous region and the hiʹvites at the base of herʹmon in the land of mizʹpah
4  so they came out with all their armies a vast multitude as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore together with very many horses and war chariots
5  all these kings agreed to meet and they came and camped together at the waters of merʹom to fight against israel
6  at this jehovah said to joshua do not be afraid because of them for about this time tomorrow i am giving over all of them slain to israel
their horses you must hamstring and their chariots you must burn in the fire
7  joshua together with all the fighting men then launched a surprise attack against them along the waters of merʹom
8  jehovah gave them into israels hand and they defeated them and pursued them as far as great siʹdon and misʹrephothmaʹim and the valley of mizʹpeh to the east and they struck them down until no survivors remained
9  joshua then did to them just as jehovah had told him he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots in the fire
10  moreover joshua then returned and captured haʹzor and struck down its king with the sword because haʹzor had formerly been the head of all these kingdoms
11  they struck down everyone in it with the sword devoting them to destruction
not a breathing thing was left
then he burned haʹzor in the fire
12  joshua captured all the cities of these kings and defeated all their kings with the sword
he devoted them to destruction just as moses the servant of jehovah had commanded
13  however israel did not burn any of the cities that stood on their mounds except haʹzor it was the only one joshua burned
14  all the spoil of these cities and the livestock the israelites plundered for themselves
but they struck every human with the sword until they had annihilated each one
they did not let anyone who breathed remain
15  just as jehovah had commanded moses his servant so moses commanded joshua and so joshua did
he left nothing undone of all that jehovah had commanded moses
16  joshua conquered all this land the mountainous region all the negʹeb all the land of goʹshen the shepheʹlah the arʹabah and the mountainous region of israel and its shepheʹlah
17  from mount haʹlak which goes up to seʹir and as far as baʹalgad in the valley of lebʹanon at the base of mount herʹmon and he captured all their kings and defeated them putting them to death
18  joshua waged war with all these kings for quite some time
19  there was no city that made peace with the israelites except the hiʹvites inhabiting gibʹeon
they conquered all the others by war
20  it was jehovah who allowed their hearts to become stubborn so that they waged war against israel in order for him to devote them to destruction without any favorable consideration
they were to be annihilated just as jehovah had commanded moses
21  at that time joshua wiped out the anʹakim from the mountainous region from hebʹron deʹbir aʹnab and all the mountainous region of judah and all the mountainous region of israel
joshua devoted them and their cities to destruction
22  there were no anʹakim left in the land of the israelites they remained only in gazʹa in gath and in ashʹdod
23  so joshua took control of all the land just as jehovah had promised moses and then joshua gave it as an inheritance to israel by their shares to be divided among their tribes
and the land had rest from war
8  then jehovah said to joshua do not be afraid or be terrified
take with you all the fighting men and go up against aʹi
see i have handed over to you the king of aʹi his people his city and his land
2  do to aʹi and to its king just as you did to jerʹicho and its king except you may plunder its spoil and its livestock for yourselves
set an ambush behind the city
3  so joshua and all the fighting men went up against aʹi
joshua chose 30000 mighty warriors and sent them off by night
4  he gave them this command see you are to lie in ambush behind the city
do not go very far from the city and all of you be ready
5  i and all the people with me will approach the city and when they come out against us as before we will retreat from them
6  when they come out after us we will draw them away from the city for they will say they are retreating from us just as before
and we will retreat from them
7  then you should rise up from the ambush and capture the city jehovah your god will hand it over to you
8  as soon as you have seized the city you should set it on fire
you should do according to jehovahs word
see i have given you your orders
9  then joshua sent them out and they marched to the place of ambush they took a position between bethʹel and aʹi to the west of aʹi while joshua spent that night with the people
10  after joshua rose up early in the morning and gathered the troops he and the elders of israel led them to aʹi
11  all the fighting men who were with him marched up and advanced to the front of the city
they camped to the north of aʹi with the valley between them and aʹi
12  in the meantime he had taken about 5000 men and had set them as an ambush between bethʹel and aʹi to the west of the city
13  so the people set the main camp to the north of the city and the rear guard west of the city and joshua went that night into the middle of the valley
14  and as soon as the king of aʹi saw this he and the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the desert plain
but he did not know that there was an ambush set against him to the rear of the city
15  when the men of aʹi attacked joshua and all israel fled along the road in the direction of the wilderness
16  then all the people who were in the city were summoned to pursue them and as they pursued joshua they were drawn away from the city
17  not a man was remaining in aʹi and bethʹel who did not go out after israel
they left the city wide open and pursued israel
18  jehovah now said to joshua stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward aʹi for into your hand i will give it
so joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city
19  the moment he stretched out his hand the ambush rose up quickly from its place and ran into the city and captured it
they immediately set the city on fire
20  when the men of aʹi turned around they saw the smoke of the city rising to the sky and they had no strength to flee in any direction
then the people who had been fleeing toward the wilderness turned on their pursuers
21  when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and saw the smoke of the city rising they turned around and attacked the men of aʹi
22  and the others came out of the city to meet them so that the men of aʹi were trapped in the middle with some israelites on this side and some on that side and they struck them down until there was not one survivor or escapee remaining
23  but they caught the king of aʹi alive and brought him before joshua
24  after israel finished killing all the inhabitants of aʹi in the field in the wilderness where they had pursued them and every last one of them had fallen by the sword then all israel returned to aʹi and struck it with the sword
25  all those who fell on that day from man to woman amounted to 12000 all the people of aʹi
26  joshua did not draw back his hand with which he had stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of aʹi to destruction
27  however israel took the livestock and the spoil of that city for themselves according to the orders that jehovah had given to joshua
28  then joshua burned aʹi and reduced it to a permanent mound of ruins as it remains to this day
29  he hung the king of aʹi on a stake until the evening and as the sun was about to set joshua gave the order to take his dead body down from the stake
then they pitched it at the entrance of the city gate and raised up a great pile of stones over him which is there to this day
30  it was then that joshua built an altar on mount eʹbal to jehovah the god of israel
31  just as moses the servant of jehovah had commanded the israelites and as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of whole stones on which no iron tool has been wielded
on it they offered up burnt offerings to jehovah as well as communion sacrifices
32  then he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law that moses had written before the israelites
33  all israel their elders the officers and their judges were standing on both sides of the ark in front of the levitical priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of jehovah
the foreign residents were there as well as the natives
half of them stood in front of mount gerʹizim and the other half in front of mount eʹbal just as moses the servant of jehovah had previously commanded to bless the people of israel
34  after this he read aloud all the words of the law the blessings and the curses according to all that is written in the book of the law
35  there was not a word of all that moses had commanded that joshua did not read aloud in front of all the congregation of israel including the women and children and the foreign residents who were living among them
16  and the land that fell by lot to the descendants of joseph was from the jordan at jerʹicho to the waters east of jerʹicho through the wilderness going up from jerʹicho into the mountainous region of bethʹel
2  it extended from bethʹel belonging to luz and continued to the boundary of the arʹchites at atʹaroth
3  then it went down westward to the boundary of the japhʹletites as far as the boundary of lower bethhoʹron and geʹzer and it ended at the sea
4  so josephs descendants manasʹseh and eʹphraim took possession of their land
5  the boundary of the descendants of eʹphraim by their families was as follows the boundary of their inheritance to the east was atʹarothadʹdar as far as upper bethhoʹron
6  and the boundary extended to the sea
michmeʹthath was on the north and the boundary went around east to taʹanathshiʹloh and it passed on the east to janoʹah
7  then it went down from janoʹah to atʹaroth and naʹarah and reached to jerʹicho and extended to the jordan
8  from tapʹpuah the boundary continued westward to the wadi of kaʹnah and it ended at the sea
this is the inheritance of the tribe of eʹphraim by their families
9  the descendants of eʹphraim also had enclave cities in the midst of the inheritance of manasʹseh all the cities and their settlements
10  but they did not drive away the caʹnaanites who were dwelling in geʹzer and the caʹnaanites continue to dwell among eʹphraim to this day and have been subjected to forced labor
18  then all the assembly of the israelites congregated at shiʹloh and they set up the tent of meeting there as the land was now subdued before them
2  but there were still seven tribes left of the israelites whose inheritance had not been allotted
3  so joshua said to the israelites how long will you put off going in to take possession of the land that jehovah the god of your forefathers has given you
4  give me three men from each tribe to send out they should go out and walk throughout the land and map it out according to their inheritance
then they should return to me
5  they must apportion it among themselves into seven shares
judah will remain in his territory to the south and the house of joseph will remain in their territory to the north
6  as for you map out the land into seven shares and bring them here to me and i will cast lots here for you before jehovah our god
7  but the levites have no share among you because the priesthood of jehovah is their inheritance and gad reuʹben and the half tribe of manasʹseh have already taken their inheritance on the east side of the jordan which moses the servant of jehovah gave them
8  the men prepared to go and joshua commanded those who were to map out the land go and walk through the land and map it out and return to me and i will cast lots for you here before jehovah in shiʹloh
9  with that the men went and traveled through the land and mapped it out by cities into seven shares recording it in a book
after that they returned to joshua at the camp in shiʹloh
10  joshua then cast lots for them in shiʹloh before jehovah
there joshua apportioned the land to the israelites by their shares
11  the lot came up for the tribe of benjamin by their families and the territory of their lot was between the people of judah and the people of joseph
12  on the north side their boundary started at the jordan and the boundary went up to the slope of jerʹicho on the north and went up on the mountain westward and it extended to the wilderness of bethaʹven
13  and the boundary continued from there to luz at the southern slope of luz that is bethʹel the boundary went down to atʹarothadʹdar on the mountain that is south of lower bethhoʹron
14  and the boundary was marked at the western side and went around toward the south from the mountain that faces bethhoʹron to the south it ended at kirʹiathbaʹal that is kirʹiathjeʹarim a city of judah
this is the western side
15  the south side was from the extremity of kirʹiathjeʹarim and the boundary extended westward it went out to the spring of the waters of nephtoʹah
16  the boundary went down to the extremity of the mountain that faces the valley of the son of hinʹnom which is in the valley of rephʹaim to the north and it went down to the valley of hinʹnom to the slope of the jebʹusite on the south and down to enroʹgel
17  and it was marked northward and extended to ensheʹmesh and then out to geliʹloth which is in front of the ascent of adumʹmim and it went down to the stone of boʹhan the son of reuʹben
18  and it continued to the northern slope in front of the arʹabah and went down to the arʹabah
19  and the boundary continued to the northern slope of bethhogʹlah and the boundary ended at the northern bay of the salt sea at the southern end of the jordan
this was the southern boundary
20  and the jordan served as its boundary on the eastern side
this was the inheritance of the descendants of benjamin by their families according to its boundaries on all sides
21  and the cities of the tribe of benjamin by their families were jerʹicho bethhogʹlah eʹmekkeʹziz
22  betharʹabah zemaraʹim bethʹel
23  avʹvim paʹrah ophʹrah
24  cheʹpharamʹmoni ophʹni and geʹba12 cities and their settlements
25  gibʹeon raʹmah beerʹoth
26  mizʹpeh chephiʹrah moʹzah
27  reʹkem irʹpeel tarʹalah
28  zeʹlah haeʹleph jebuʹsi that is jerusalem gibʹeah and kirʹiath14 cities and their settlements
this was the inheritance of the descendants of benjamin by their families
17  then the lot fell for the tribe of manasʹseh because he was josephs firstborn
since maʹchir the firstborn of manasʹseh and the father of gilʹead was a man of war he received gilʹead and baʹshan
2  and the lot fell for the rest of the descendants of manasʹseh according to their families for the sons of abieʹzer the sons of heʹlek the sons of asʹriel the sons of sheʹchem the sons of heʹpher and the sons of shemiʹda
these were the descendants of manasʹseh the son of joseph the males according to their families
3  but zeloʹphehad the son of heʹpher the son of gilʹead the son of maʹchir the son of manasʹseh did not have sons only daughters and these were the names of his daughters mahʹlah noah hogʹlah milʹcah and tirʹzah
4  so they presented themselves before eleaʹzar the priest joshua the son of nun and the chieftains saying it was jehovah who commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers
so at the order of jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father
5  there were also ten allotments that fell to manasʹseh apart from the land of gilʹead and baʹshan which were on the other side of the jordan
6  for the daughters of manasʹseh received an inheritance along with his sons and the land of gilʹead became the property of the rest of the descendants of manasʹseh
7  and the boundary of manasʹseh was from ashʹer to michmeʹthath which faces sheʹchem and the boundary continued toward the south to the land of the inhabitants of entapʹpuah
8  the land of tapʹpuah became manasʹsehs but tapʹpuah on manasʹsehs boundary belonged to the descendants of eʹphraim
9  and the boundary went down to the wadi of kaʹnah southward to the wadi
there were cities of eʹphraim among the cities of manasʹseh and the boundary of manasʹseh was on the north of the wadi and it ended at the sea
10  to the south it belonged to eʹphraim and to the north it belonged to manasʹseh and the sea was his boundary and on the north they reached to ashʹer and on the east to isʹsachar
11  in the territories of isʹsachar and ashʹer manasʹseh was given bethsheʹan and its dependent towns ibʹleam and its dependent towns the inhabitants of dor and its dependent towns the inhabitants of endor and its dependent towns the inhabitants of taʹanach and its dependent towns and the inhabitants of megidʹdo and its dependent towns three of the heights
12  but the descendants of manasʹseh were not able to take possession of these cities the caʹnaanites persisted in dwelling in this land
13  when the israelites grew strong they subjected the caʹnaanites to forced labor but they did not drive them out entirely
14  the descendants of joseph said to joshua why have you given us as an inheritance only one lot and one allotment we are a numerous people for jehovah has blessed us until now
15  joshua replied to them if you are such a numerous people go up to the forest and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the perʹizzites and the rephʹaim since the mountainous region of eʹphraim is too cramped for you
16  then the descendants of joseph said the mountainous region is not enough for us and all the caʹnaanites who are dwelling in the land of the valley have war chariots with iron scythes both those in bethsheʹan and its dependent towns and those in the valley of jezʹreel
17  so joshua said this to the house of joseph to eʹphraim and manasʹseh you are a numerous people and you have great power
you will not receive only one lot
18  but the mountainous region will also be yours
although it is a forest you will clear it and it will be the extremity of your territory
for you will drive away the caʹnaanites even though they are strong and have war chariots with iron scythes
9  when all the kings who were on the west side of the jordan heard what had happened those in the mountainous region in the shepheʹlah along the entire coast of the great sea and in front of lebʹanonthe hitʹtites the amʹorites the caʹnaanites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites
2  they formed an alliance to fight against joshua and israel
3  the inhabitants of gibʹeon also heard what joshua had done to jerʹicho and aʹi
4  so they acted shrewdly and put provisions into wornout sacks on their donkeys along with wornout wineskins that had burst and had been mended
5  they also had wornout and patched sandals on their feet and they were wearing wornout garments
all the bread of their provisions was dry and crumbly
6  then they went to joshua at the camp at gilʹgal and said to him and the men of israel we have come from a distant land
now make a covenant with us
7  but the men of israel said to the hiʹvites perhaps you are living near us
so how can we make a covenant with you
8  they replied to joshua we are your servants
then joshua said to them who are you and where do you come from
9  at this they said to him your servants have come from a very distant land out of regard for the name of jehovah your god because we have heard about his fame and about all he did in egypt
10  and about all he did to the two kings of the amʹorites who were on the other side of the jordan king siʹhon of heshʹbon and king og of baʹshan who was in ashʹtaroth
11  so our elders and all the inhabitants of our land told us take provisions with you for the journey and go to meet them
tell them we will be your servants now make a covenant with us
12  this bread that we took as our provisions was still hot on the day we left our houses to come here to you
now you can see it is dry and crumbly
13  and these wineskins were new when we filled them but now they have burst
and our garments and sandals have worn out because of the great length of the journey
14  at that the men took some of their provisions but they did not inquire of jehovah
15  so joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to let them live and that is what the chieftains of the assembly swore to them in an oath
16  at the end of three days after they made a covenant with them they heard that they lived nearby in their vicinity
17  then the israelites set out and came to their cities on the third day their cities were gibʹeon chephiʹrah beerʹoth and kirʹiathjeʹarim
18  but the israelites did not attack them because the chieftains of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by jehovah the god of israel
so all the assembly began to murmur against the chieftains
19  at this all the chieftains said to the entire assembly since we swore an oath to them by jehovah the god of israel we are not allowed to hurt them
20  this is what we will do we will let them live so that there is no indignation against us because of the oath that we swore to them
21  and the chieftains added let them live but let them become gatherers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly
this is what the chieftains promised them
22  joshua now called them and said to them why did you trick us by saying we are from a place very far away from you when you really live right among us
23  from now on you are cursed and you will always occupy a slaves position as gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god
24  they answered joshua it was because your servants were plainly told that jehovah your god had commanded moses his servant to give you all the land and to annihilate all its inhabitants from before you
so we were afraid for our lives because of you and that is why we did this
25  now we are at your mercy
do to us whatever you think is good and right
26  and that is what he did with them he saved them from the hands of the israelites and they did not kill them
27  but that day joshua made them gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for jehovahs altar at the place that he should choose and they remain so to this day
7  but the israelites were unfaithful with regard to what had been devoted to destruction for aʹchan son of carʹmi son of zabʹdi son of zeʹrah of the tribe of judah took some of what was devoted to destruction
at this jehovahs anger blazed against the israelites
2  then joshua sent men out from jerʹicho to aʹi which is close by bethaʹven and east of bethʹel telling them go up and spy on the land
so the men went up and spied on aʹi
3  when they returned to joshua they told him not all the people need to go up
about two or three thousand men are enough to defeat aʹi
do not tire out all the people by making them go for there are only a few of them
4  so about 3000 men went up there but they had to flee from the men of aʹi
5  the men of aʹi struck down 36 men and they pursued them from outside the city gate as far as shebʹarim and they continued striking them down on the descent
so the courage of the people melted and flowed away like water
6  at this joshua ripped his garments and fell with his face to the ground before the ark of jehovah until the evening he and the elders of israel and they kept throwing dust on their heads
7  joshua said alas sovereign lord jehovah why did you bring this people all the way across the jordan just to hand us over to the amʹorites to be destroyed if only we had been satisfied to remain on the other side of the jordan
8  pardon me o jehovah what can i say now that israel has retreated before his enemies
9  when the caʹnaanites and all the inhabitants of the land hear about it they will surround us and wipe out our very name from the earth and what will you do about your great name
10  jehovah replied to joshua get up why are you lying on your face
11  israel has sinned
they have violated my covenant that i commanded them to keep
they took some of what was devoted to destruction stealing it and secretly putting it among their own possessions
12  therefore the israelites will not be able to stand against their enemies
they will turn their backs and flee from their enemies because they have become something devoted to destruction
i will not be with you again unless you annihilate from your midst what was devoted to destruction
13  get up and sanctify the people tell them sanctify yourselves tomorrow for this is what jehovah the god of israel says what is devoted to destruction is among you o israel
you will not be able to stand against your enemies until you remove from your midst the thing devoted to destruction
14  you are to present yourselves in the morning tribe by tribe and the tribe that jehovah selects will come near family by family and the family that jehovah selects will come near household by household and the household that jehovah selects will come near man by man
15  and the one who is caught with the thing devoted to destruction will be burned with fire he and all that belongs to him because he has violated the covenant of jehovah and because he has committed a disgraceful act in israel
16  so joshua rose early the next morning and had israel come near tribe by tribe and the tribe of judah was selected
17  he had the families of judah come near and the family of the zeʹrahites was selected after which he had the family of the zeʹrahites come near man by man and zabʹdi was selected
18  finally he had the household of zabʹdi come near man by man and aʹchan son of carʹmi son of zabʹdi son of zeʹrah of the tribe of judah was selected
19  then joshua said to aʹchan my son please honor jehovah the god of israel and make confession to him
tell me please what you have done
do not hide it from me
20  aʹchan answered joshua for a fact i am the one who sinned against jehovah the god of israel and this is what i have done
21  when i saw among the spoil a goodlooking official garment from shiʹnar and 200 shekels of silver and one gold bar weighing 50 shekels i desired them so i took them
they are now hidden in the ground inside my tent with the money underneath
22  at once joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent and there the garment was hidden in his tent with the money underneath it
23  so they took the things out of the tent and brought them to joshua and all the israelites and placed them before jehovah
24  joshua and all israel with him then took aʹchan the son of zeʹrah the silver the official garment and the bar of gold along with his sons his daughters his bull his donkey his flock his tent and everything that was his and they brought them up to the valley of aʹchor
25  joshua said why have you brought disaster upon us jehovah will bring disaster upon you on this day
with that all israel stoned him after which they burned them with fire
thus they stoned all of them
26  and they raised a huge pile of stones over him that remains to this day
at this jehovahs hot anger subsided
that is why the name of that place is valley of aʹchor to this day
23  many days after jehovah had given israel rest from all its surrounding enemies when joshua was old and advanced in years
2  joshua summoned all israel its elders its heads its judges and its officers and he said to them i have grown old i am advanced in years
3  and you have seen for yourselves all that jehovah your god did to all these nations in your behalf because jehovah your god was the one who was fighting for you
4  see i assigned to you by lot the land of the nations that remain as an inheritance for your tribes as well as that of all the nations that i destroyed from the jordan to the great sea on the west
5  and jehovah your god was the one who kept thrusting them away from before you and he drove them out for you and you took possession of their land just as jehovah your god promised you
6  now you must be very courageous to observe and carry out all that is written in the book of the law of moses by never deviating from it to the right or to the left
7  by never mingling with these nations that remain with you
you must not even mention the names of their gods nor swear by them and you must never serve them nor bow down to them
8  but you must stick to jehovah your god just as you have done down to this day
9  jehovah will drive away great and mighty nations from before you for not a man has been able to stand before you to this day
10  just one man of you will chase a thousand because jehovah your god is fighting for you just as he promised you
11  so be on guard constantly by loving jehovah your god
12  but if you should turn back at all and stick to what is left of these nations that remain with you and you form marriage alliances with them and associate with them and they with you
13  you should know for sure that jehovah your god will not continue to drive out these nations for you
they will become a trap and a snare and a scourge on your flanks and thorns in your eyes until you have perished from this good land that jehovah your god has given you
14  now look i am about to die and you well know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word out of all the good promises that jehovah your god has spoken to you has failed
they have all come true for you
not one word of them has failed
15  but just as all the good promises that jehovah your god has spoken to you have come upon you so jehovah will bring upon you all the calamity that he promised and will annihilate you from this good land that jehovah your god has given you
16  if you violate the covenant of jehovah your god that he commanded you to keep and if you go and serve other gods and bow down to them then jehovahs anger will blaze against you and you will quickly perish from the good land that he has given you
22  then joshua summoned the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh
2  and said to them you have done all that moses the servant of jehovah commanded you and you have obeyed my voice in all that i commanded you
3  you have not forsaken your brothers all this time down to this day and you have kept the obligation of the commandment of jehovah your god
4  now jehovah your god has given your brothers rest just as he promised them
so now you may return to your tents in the land that moses the servant of jehovah gave you to possess on the other side of the jordan
5  only be very careful to carry out the commandment and the law that moses the servant of jehovah gave you by loving jehovah your god by walking in all his ways by keeping his commandments by sticking to him and by serving him with all your heart and with all your soul
6  then joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went to their tents
7  and to the half tribe of manasʹseh moses had given an inheritance in baʹshan and to the other half of the tribe joshua gave land on the west side of the jordan along with their brothers
moreover when joshua sent them away to their tents he blessed them
8  and said to them return to your tents with many riches with very much livestock with silver and gold copper and iron and garments in very great quantity
take your share of the spoil of your enemies along with your brothers
9  after that the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh departed from the other israelites from shiʹloh in the land of caʹnaan and they returned to the land of gilʹead the land of their possession where they had settled at the order of jehovah through moses
10  when they came to the regions of the jordan in the land of caʹnaan the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh built an altar there by the jordan a large impressive altar
11  later the other israelites heard about it and said look the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh have built an altar on the frontier of the land of caʹnaan in the regions of the jordan on the side belonging to the israelites
12  when the israelites heard about it the whole assembly of the israelites congregated at shiʹloh to go to war against them
13  then the israelites sent phinʹehas the son of eleaʹzar the priest to the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh in the land of gilʹead
14  and ten chieftains were with him one chieftain of each paternal house of all the tribes of israel each a head of his paternal house among the thousands of israel
15  when they came to the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh in the land of gilʹead they said to them
16  this is what all the assembly of jehovah says what is this act of unfaithfulness that you have committed against the god of israel you have turned back today from following jehovah by building yourselves an altar and rebelling against jehovah
17  was the error of peʹor not enough for us we have not cleansed ourselves from it down to this day even though a plague came upon the assembly of jehovah
18  and you would turn back today from following jehovah if you rebel today against jehovah then tomorrow he will be indignant against the entire assembly of israel
19  now if it is because the land of your possession is unclean cross over to the land of jehovahs possession where the tabernacle of jehovah resides and settle among us but do not rebel against jehovah and do not make us rebels by building yourselves an altar in addition to the altar of jehovah our god
20  when aʹchan the son of zeʹrah committed an act of unfaithfulness regarding what was devoted to destruction did not indignation come against all the assembly of israel and he was not the only man to die for his error
21  at this the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh said in answer to the heads of the thousands of israel
22  the god of gods jehovah the god of gods jehovah he knows and israel will also know
if we were rebellious and unfaithful to jehovah do not spare us this day
23  if we built ourselves an altar to turn back from following jehovah and to offer burnt offerings grain offerings and communion sacrifices on it jehovah will exact the penalty
24  no it was because of another concern that we did this for we said in the future your sons will say to our sons what do you have to do with jehovah the god of israel
25  jehovah has put the jordan as a boundary between us and you the reuʹbenites and the gadʹites
you have no share in jehovah
and your sons will hinder our sons from worshipping jehovah
26  so we said let us by all means take action by building an altar not for burnt offerings or sacrifices
27  but to be a witness between you and us and our descendants after us that we will carry out our service to jehovah before him with our burnt offerings and our sacrifices and our communion sacrifices so that your sons may not say to our sons in the future you have no share in jehovah
28  so we said if they should say that to us and to our descendants in the future we will then say see the replica of jehovahs altar that our forefathers made not for burnt offerings or sacrifices but to be a witness between you and us
29  it is unthinkable for us to rebel against jehovah and to turn back today from following jehovah by building an altar for burnt offerings grain offerings and sacrifices other than the altar of jehovah our god that is before his tabernacle
30  when phinʹehas the priest the chieftains of the assembly and the heads of the thousands of israel who were with him heard the words that the descendants of reuʹben gad and manasʹseh spoke they were satisfied
31  so phinʹehas the son of eleaʹzar the priest said to the descendants of reuʹben gad and manasʹseh today we know that jehovah is among us because you have not committed this act of unfaithfulness against jehovah
now you have saved the israelites out of the hand of jehovah
32  then phinʹehas the son of eleaʹzar the priest and the chieftains returned from the reuʹbenites and the gadʹites in the land of gilʹead to the land of caʹnaan and they brought back word to the other israelites
33  and the israelites were satisfied with the report
the israelites then praised god and they said nothing more about going to war against the reuʹbenites and the gadʹites to destroy the land in which they were dwelling
34  so the reuʹbenites and the gadʹites named the altar because it is a witness between us that jehovah is the true god
6  now jerʹicho was tightly shut up because of the israelites no one was leaving and no one was entering
2  jehovah then said to joshua see i have handed over to you jerʹicho and its king and its mighty warriors
3  all you fighting men should march around the city going around the city once
that is what you should do for six days
4  have seven priests carry seven rams horns before the ark
but on the seventh day you should march around the city seven times and the priests should blow the horns
5  when the rams horn is soundedas soon as you hear the sound of the hornall the people should shout a great war cry
then the wall of the city will fall down flat and the people must go up each one straight ahead
6  so joshua the son of nun called the priests together and told them take up the ark of the covenant and seven priests should carry seven rams horns before the ark of jehovah
7  then he told the people move on and march around the city and the armed troops should go ahead of the ark of jehovah
8  and just as joshua had spoken to the people the seven priests carrying seven rams horns before jehovah went forward and blew the horns and the ark of the covenant of jehovah was following them
9  and the armed troops went ahead of the priests who were blowing the horns and the rear guard followed the ark as the horns were blown continuously
10  now joshua had commanded the people do not shout nor let your voices be heard
not a word should come out of your mouths until the day i say to you shout then shout
11  he had the ark of jehovah go around the city going around it once after which they returned to the camp and spent the night there
12  the next morning joshua got up early and the priests took up the ark of jehovah
13  and seven priests carrying seven rams horns walked before the ark of jehovah continuously blowing the horns
the armed troops were walking ahead of them while the rear guard was following the ark of jehovah as the horns were blown continuously
14  they marched around the city on the second day once after which they returned to the camp
that was what they did for six days
15  on the seventh day they got up early as soon as the dawn broke and they marched around the city in the same manner seven times
it was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times
16  and on the seventh time the priests blew the horns and joshua told the people shout for jehovah has given you the city
17  the city and everything in it is to be devoted to destruction it all belongs to jehovah
only raʹhab the prostitute may keep living she and all who are with her in the house because she hid the messengers we sent out
18  but keep away from what is devoted to destruction so that you do not desire something devoted to destruction and take it making the camp of israel something devoted to destruction by bringing disaster on it
19  but all the silver and the gold and the articles of copper and iron are holy to jehovah
they should go into the treasury of jehovah
20  then the people shouted when the horns were blown
as soon as the people heard the sound of the horn and shouted a great war cry the wall fell down flat
after that the people went up into the city each one straight ahead and they captured the city
21  they devoted all that was in the city to destruction by the sword man and woman young and old bull sheep and donkey
22  joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and all who belong to her just as you swore to her
23  so the young spies went in and brought out raʹhab along with her father her mother her brothers and all who belonged to her yes they brought out her whole family and they brought them safely to a place outside the camp of israel
24  then they burned the city and everything in it with fire
but the silver the gold and the articles of copper and iron they gave to the treasury of jehovahs house
25  only raʹhab the prostitute and her fathers household and all who belonged to her were spared by joshua and she lives in israel to this day because she hid the messengers whom joshua sent out to spy on jerʹicho
26  at that time joshua pronounced this oath cursed be the man before jehovah who undertakes to rebuild this city of jerʹicho
at the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation and at the cost of his youngest he will put up its doors
27  so jehovah was with joshua and his fame spread through all the earth
21  the heads of the paternal houses of the levites now approached eleaʹzar the priest joshua the son of nun and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of israel
2  and they spoke to them in shiʹloh in the land of caʹnaan saying jehovah through moses commanded that we be given cities in which to dwell along with their pastures for our livestock
3  so at the order of jehovah the israelites gave the levites these cities and their pastures out of their own inheritance
4  the lot came out for the families of the koʹhathites and the levites who were descendants of aaron the priest were given by lot 13 cities out of the tribe of judah the tribe of simʹeon and the tribe of benjamin
5  and for the rest of the koʹhathites there were allotted ten cities out of the families of the tribe of eʹphraim the tribe of dan and the half tribe of manasʹseh
6  and for the gerʹshonites there were allotted 13 cities out of the families of the tribe of isʹsachar the tribe of ashʹer the tribe of naphʹtali and the half tribe of manasʹseh in baʹshan
7  for the merarʹites by their families there were 12 cities out of the tribe of reuʹben the tribe of gad and the tribe of zebʹulun
8  thus the israelites gave the levites these cities and their pastures by lot just as jehovah had commanded through moses
9  so from the tribe of judah and the tribe of simʹeon they gave these cities here mentioned by name
10  and they were given to the sons of aaron of the koʹhathite families of the levites because they received the first lot
11  they gave them kirʹiatharʹba arʹba was the father of aʹnak that is hebʹron in the mountainous region of judah and its surrounding pastures
12  but the field of the city and its settlements they gave to caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh as his possession
13  and to the sons of aaron the priest they gave the city of refuge for the manslayer namely hebʹron with its pastures also libʹnah with its pastures
14  jatʹtir with its pastures eshtemoʹa with its pastures
15  hoʹlon with its pastures deʹbir with its pastures
16  aʹin with its pastures jutʹtah with its pastures and bethsheʹmesh with its pasturesnine cities out of these two tribes
17  and from the tribe of benjamin gibʹeon with its pastures geʹba with its pastures
18  anʹathoth with its pastures and alʹmon with its pasturesfour cities
19  all the cities given to the descendants of aaron the priests were 13 cities with their pastures
20  and the rest of the koʹhathite families among the levites were given by lot cities from the tribe of eʹphraim
21  they gave them the city of refuge for the manslayer namely sheʹchem with its pastures in the mountainous region of eʹphraim geʹzer with its pastures
22  kibʹzaim with its pastures and bethhoʹron with its pasturesfour cities
23  and from the tribe of dan elʹteke with its pastures gibʹbethon with its pastures
24  aiʹjalon with its pastures gathrimʹmon with its pasturesfour cities
25  and from the half tribe of manasʹseh taʹanach with its pastures and gathrimʹmon with its pasturestwo cities
26  all the cities together with their pastures that the rest of the families of the koʹhathites received were ten
27  and the gerʹshonites of the families of the levites received from the half tribe of manasʹseh the city of refuge for the manslayer namely goʹlan in baʹshan with its pastures and beeshʹterah with its pasturestwo cities
28  and from the tribe of isʹsachar kishʹion with its pastures dabʹerath with its pastures
29  jarʹmuth with its pastures and enganʹnim with its pasturesfour cities
30  and from the tribe of ashʹer miʹshal with its pastures abʹdon with its pastures
31  helʹkath with its pastures and reʹhob with its pasturesfour cities
32  and from the tribe of naphʹtali the city of refuge for the manslayer namely keʹdesh in galʹilee with its pastures hamʹmothdor with its pastures and karʹtan with its pasturesthree cities
33  all the cities of the gerʹshonites by their families were 13 cities with their pastures
34  and the families of the merarʹites the rest of the levites received from the tribe of zebʹulun jokʹneam with its pastures karʹtah with its pastures
35  dimʹnah with its pastures and nahalʹal with its pasturesfour cities
36  and from the tribe of reuʹben beʹzer with its pastures jaʹhaz with its pastures
37  kedʹemoth with its pastures and mephʹaath with its pasturesfour cities
38  and from the tribe of gad the city of refuge for the manslayer namely raʹmoth in gilʹead with its pastures mahanaʹim with its pastures
39  heshʹbon with its pastures and jaʹzer with its pasturesa total of four cities
40  all the cities that were allotted to the merarʹites by their families the rest of the families of the levites were 12 cities
41  all the cities of the levites within the possession of the israelites were 48 cities together with their pastures
42  each of these cities had its pastures all around itthis was the case for all these cities
43  so jehovah gave israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their forefathers and they took possession of it and settled in it
44  furthermore jehovah gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their forefathers and not one of all their enemies could stand against them
jehovah gave all their enemies into their hand
45  not a promise failed out of all the good promises that jehovah had made to the house of israel all of them came true
13  now joshua had grown old and was advanced in years
so jehovah said to him you have grown old and are advanced in years but much of the land remains to be taken in possession
2  this is the land remaining all the regions of the philisʹtines and all the geshʹurites
3  from the branch of the nile that is east of egypt up to the border of ekʹron to the north which used to be considered caʹnaanite territory including that of the five lords of the philisʹtinesthe gazʹites the ashʹdodites the ashʹkelonites the gitʹtites and the ekʹronites that of the avʹvim
4  to the south all the land of the caʹnaanites mearʹah which belongs to the sidoʹnians as far as aʹphek to the border of the amʹorites
5  the land of the geʹbalites and all of lebʹanon toward the east from baʹalgad at the base of mount herʹmon to leʹbohaʹmath
6  all the inhabitants of the mountainous region from lebʹanon to misʹrephothmaʹim and all the sidoʹnians
i will drive them out before the israelites
you have only to assign it to israel as an inheritance just as i have commanded you
7  now you must apportion this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half tribe of manasʹseh
8  with the other half tribe the reuʹbenites and the gadʹites took their inheritance that moses gave them on the east side of the jordan just as moses the servant of jehovah had given them
9  from aroʹer which is on the rim of the arʹnon valley and the city that is in the middle of the valley and all the tableland of medʹeba as far as diʹbon
10  and all the cities of king siʹhon of the amʹorites who reigned in heshʹbon up to the border of the amʹmonites
11  also gilʹead and the territory of the geshʹurites and the maacʹathites and all mount herʹmon and all baʹshan as far as salʹecah
12  all the royal realm of og in baʹshan who reigned in ashʹtaroth and in edʹrei
he was one of the last of the rephʹaim
moses defeated them and drove them out
13  but the israelites did not drive out the geshʹurites and the maacʹathites for geshʹur and maʹacath live in the midst of israel to this day
14  it was only to the tribe of the levites that he did not give an inheritance
the offerings made by fire to jehovah the god of israel are their inheritance just as he promised them
15  then moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the reuʹbenites by their families
16  and their territory was from aroʹer which is on the rim of the arʹnon valley and the city in the middle of the valley and all the tableland by medʹeba
17  heshʹbon and all its towns on the tableland diʹbon baʹmothbaʹal bethbaʹalmeʹon
18  jaʹhaz kedʹemoth mephʹaath
19  kiriathaʹim sibʹmah and zeʹrethshaʹhar on the mountain of the valley
20  bethpeʹor the slopes of pisʹgah bethjeshʹimoth
21  all the cities of the tableland and all the royal realm of king siʹhon of the amʹorites who reigned in heshʹbon
moses defeated him and the midʹianite chieftains eʹvi reʹkem zur hur and reʹba vassals of siʹhon who were dwelling in the land
22  baʹlaam the son of beʹor the diviner was one whom the israelites killed with the sword along with the rest who were slain
23  the boundary of the reuʹbenites was the jordan and this territory was the inheritance of the reuʹbenites by their families with the cities and their settlements
24  furthermore moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of gad the gadʹites by their families
25  and their territory included jaʹzer and all the cities of gilʹead and half of the land of the amʹmonites as far as aroʹer which faces rabʹbah
26  and from heshʹbon to raʹmathmizʹpeh and betʹonim and from mahanaʹim to the border of deʹbir
27  and in the valley bethhaʹram bethnimʹrah sucʹcoth and zaʹphon the rest of the royal realm of king siʹhon of heshʹbon with the jordan as the border from the lower end of the sea of chinʹnereth on the east side of the jordan
28  this was the inheritance of the gadʹites by their families with the cities and their settlements
29  further moses gave an inheritance to the half tribe of manasʹseh to half of the tribe of manasʹseh by their families
30  and their territory extended from mahanaʹim and took in all of baʹshan all the royal realm of king og of baʹshan and all the tent villages of jaʹir in baʹshan 60 towns
31  and half of gilʹead and ashʹtaroth and edʹrei the cities of the royal realm of og in baʹshan went to the sons of maʹchir the son of manasʹseh to half of the sons of maʹchir by their families
32  these were the inheritances that moses gave them on the desert plains of moʹab beyond the jordan east of jerʹicho
33  but to the tribe of the levites moses did not give an inheritance
jehovah the god of israel is their inheritance just as he promised them
14  now this is what the israelites took as an inheritance in the land of caʹnaan which eleaʹzar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of israel gave them to inherit
2  their inheritance was by lot just as jehovah had commanded through moses for the nine and a half tribes
3  moses had given the inheritance of the other two and a half tribes on the other side of the jordan and to the levites he did not give an inheritance among them
4  the descendants of joseph were considered two tribes manasʹseh and eʹphraim and they did not give a share in the land to the levites except cities to dwell in and their pastures for their livestock and their property
5  so the israelites apportioned the land just as jehovah had commanded moses
6  then the men of judah approached joshua in gilʹgal and caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh the kenʹizzite said to him you well know what jehovah said to moses the man of the true god about you and me at kaʹdeshbarʹnea
7  i was 40 years old when moses the servant of jehovah sent me out of kaʹdeshbarʹnea to spy out the land and i returned with a forthright report
8  although my brothers who went up with me caused the people to lose heart i followed jehovah my god wholeheartedly
9  moses swore on that day saying the land on which your foot has walked will become a lasting inheritance for you and your sons because you have followed jehovah my god wholeheartedly
10  now just as he promised jehovah has preserved me alive these 45 years since jehovah made this promise to moses when israel walked in the wilderness i am still here today 85 years old
11  and today i am as strong as on the day moses sent me out
my strength is now as it was then for war and for other activities
12  therefore give me this mountainous region that jehovah promised on that day
though you heard on that day that there were anʹakim there with great fortified cities surely jehovah will be with me and i will drive them out just as jehovah promised
13  so joshua blessed him and gave hebʹron to caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh as an inheritance
14  that is why hebʹron belongs to caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh the kenʹizzite as an inheritance to this day because he followed jehovah the god of israel wholeheartedly
15  the name of hebʹron was previously kirʹiatharʹba arʹba was the great man among the anʹakim
and the land had rest from war
19  then the second lot came out for simʹeon for the tribe of simʹeon by their families
and their inheritance was within the inheritance of judah
2  their inheritance was beʹersheʹba with sheʹba molaʹdah
3  haʹzarshuʹal baʹlah eʹzem
4  eltoʹlad beʹthul horʹmah
5  zikʹlag bethmarʹcaboth haʹzarsuʹsah
6  bethlebaʹoth and sharuʹhen13 cities and their settlements
7  aʹin rimʹmon eʹther and aʹshanfour cities and their settlements
8  and all the settlements that were around these cities as far as baʹalathbeʹer raʹmah of the south
this was the inheritance of the tribe of simʹeon by their families
9  the inheritance of the descendants of simʹeon was taken out of the allotment of judah because the share of judah was too large for them
so the descendants of simʹeon received a possession within their inheritance
10  next the third lot came up for the descendants of zebʹulun by their families and the boundary of their inheritance went as far as saʹrid
11  their boundary went up westward to marʹeal and reached to dabʹbesheth and then to the valley in front of jokʹneam
12  and it went from saʹrid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of chisʹlothtaʹbor and out to dabʹerath and then up to japhiʹa
13  and from there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to gathheʹpher to ethkaʹzin and out to rimʹmon and it extended to neʹah
14  and the boundary went around it on the north to hanʹnathon and it ended at the valley of iphʹtahel
15  and katʹtath nahalʹal shimʹron iʹdalah and bethʹlehem12 cities and their settlements
16  this was the inheritance of the descendants of zebʹulun by their families
these were the cities and their settlements
17  the fourth lot came out for isʹsachar for the descendants of isʹsachar by their families
18  and their boundary was to jezʹreel chesulʹloth shuʹnem
19  haphʹaraʹim shiʹon anahaʹrath
20  rabʹbith kishʹion eʹbez
21  reʹmeth enganʹnim enhadʹdah and bethpazʹzez
22  and the boundary reached to taʹbor and shahazuʹmah and bethsheʹmesh and the end of their border was at the jordan16 cities and their settlements
23  this was the inheritance of the tribe of isʹsachar by their families the cities and their settlements
24  then the fifth lot came out for the tribe of ashʹer by their families
25  and their boundary was helʹkath haʹli beʹten achʹshaph
26  allamʹmelech aʹmad and miʹshal
it reached westward to carʹmel and to shiʹhorlibʹnath
27  and it went back toward the east to bethdaʹgon and reached to zebʹulun and the valley of iphʹtahel to the north to betheʹmek and neiʹel and it extended to caʹbul on the left
28  and to eʹbron reʹhob hamʹmon and kaʹnah as far as great siʹdon
29  and the boundary went back to raʹmah and as far as the fortified city of tyre
then the boundary went back to hoʹsah and it ended at the sea in the region of achʹzib
30  umʹmah aʹphek and reʹhob22 cities and their settlements
31  this was the inheritance of the tribe of ashʹer by their families
these were the cities and their settlements
32  the sixth lot came out for the descendants of naphʹtali for the descendants of naphʹtali by their families
33  their boundary was from heʹleph from the big tree in zaananʹnim and adʹamineʹkeb and jabʹneel as far as lakʹkum and it ended at the jordan
34  the boundary went back westward to azʹnothtaʹbor and extended from there to hukʹkok and reached to zebʹulun on the south and to ashʹer on the west and to judah at the jordan toward the east
35  and the fortified cities were zidʹdim zer hamʹmath rakʹkath chinʹnereth
36  adʹamah raʹmah haʹzor
37  keʹdesh edʹrei enhaʹzor
38  yiʹron migʹdalel hoʹrem bethaʹnath and bethsheʹmesh19 cities and their settlements
39  this was the inheritance of the tribe of naphʹtali by their families the cities and their settlements
40  the seventh lot came out for the tribe of dan by their families
41  and the border of their inheritance was zoʹrah eshʹtaol irsheʹmesh
42  shaalabʹbin aiʹjalon ithʹlah
43  eʹlon timʹnah ekʹron
44  elʹtekeh gibʹbethon baʹalath
45  jeʹhud benʹebeʹrak gathrimʹmon
46  mejarʹkon and rakʹkon with the border facing jopʹpa
47  but the territory of dan was too cramped for them
so they went up and fought against leʹshem and captured it and struck it with the sword
then they took possession of it and settled in it and they changed the name of leʹshem to dan after the name of dan their forefather
48  this was the inheritance of the tribe of dan by their families
these were the cities and their settlements
49  thus they finished dividing the land for inheritance by its territories
then the israelites gave joshua the son of nun an inheritance in their midst
50  at the order of jehovah they gave him the city he asked for timʹnathseʹrah in the mountainous region of eʹphraim and he built up the city and settled in it
51  these were the inheritances that eleaʹzar the priest joshua the son of nun and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of israel distributed by lot in shiʹloh before jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting
so they finished apportioning the land
24  joshua then assembled all the tribes of israel together at sheʹchem and summoned the elders of israel its heads its judges and its officers and they stood before the true god
2  joshua said to all the people this is what jehovah the god of israel says it was on the other side of the river that your forefathers lived a long time agoteʹrah the father of abraham and the father of naʹhorand they used to serve other gods
3  in time i took your forefather abraham from the other side of the river and had him walk through all the land of caʹnaan and made his offspring many
i gave him isaac
4  then to isaac i gave jacob and eʹsau
later to eʹsau i gave mount seʹir as his possession and jacob and his sons went down to egypt
5  i later sent moses and aaron and i plagued egypt with what i did among them and then i brought you out
6  when i was bringing your fathers out of egypt and you came to the sea the egyptians were chasing after your fathers with war chariots and cavalrymen as far as the red sea
7  they began to cry out to jehovah so he placed a darkness between you and the egyptians and brought the sea over them and covered them and your own eyes saw what i did in egypt
then you dwelled in the wilderness many years
8  and i brought you to the land of the amʹorites who were dwelling on the other side of the jordan and they fought against you
but i gave them into your hand so that you could take possession of their land and i annihilated them from before you
9  then baʹlak son of zipʹpor the king of moʹab rose up and fought against israel
so he summoned baʹlaam the son of beʹor to curse you
10  but i would not listen to baʹlaam
so he blessed you repeatedly and i rescued you from his hand
11  then you crossed the jordan and came to jerʹicho
and the leaders of jerʹicho the amʹorites the perʹizzites the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the girʹgashites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites fought against you but i gave them into your hand
12  so i sent the feeling of dejection ahead of you and it drove them out from before youtwo kings of the amʹorites
it was not by your sword and not by your bow
13  thus i gave you a land for which you had not toiled and cities that you had not built and you settled in them
you are eating from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant
14  therefore fear jehovah and serve him with integrity and faithfulness and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the river and in egypt and serve jehovah
15  now if it seems bad to you to serve jehovah choose for yourselves today whom you will serve whether the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the river or the gods of the amʹorites in whose land you are dwelling
but as for me and my household we will serve jehovah
16  at this the people answered it is unthinkable for us to abandon jehovah and to serve other gods
17  it is jehovah our god who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of egypt out of the house of slavery and who performed these great signs before our eyes and who kept guarding us the entire way in which we walked and among all the peoples through whom we passed
18  jehovah drove out all the peoples including the amʹorites who lived in the land before us
therefore we too will serve jehovah because he is our god
19  then joshua said to the people you are not able to serve jehovah for he is a holy god he is a god who requires exclusive devotion
he will not pardon your transgressions and your sins
20  if you abandon jehovah and serve foreign gods he will also turn against you and exterminate you after doing good for you
21  but the people said to joshua no but we will serve jehovah
22  so joshua said to the people you are witnesses against yourselves that of your own accord you have chosen for yourselves to serve jehovah
to this they said we are witnesses
23  therefore remove the foreign gods that are among you and incline your hearts to jehovah the god of israel
24  the people said to joshua we will serve jehovah our god and we will obey his voice
25  so joshua made a covenant with the people on that day and established a regulation and a ruling for them in sheʹchem
26  then joshua wrote these words in the book of gods law and took a great stone and set it up under the large tree that is by the sanctuary of jehovah
27  joshua went on to say to all the people look this stone will serve as a witness against us because it has heard everything jehovah said to us and it will serve as a witness against you so that you may not deny your god
28  with that joshua sent the people away each one to his inheritance
29  after these things joshua the son of nun the servant of jehovah died at the age of 110
30  so they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in timʹnathseʹrah which is in the mountainous region of eʹphraim north of mount gaʹash
31  israel continued to serve jehovah all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived joshua and who had known all of jehovahs deeds in behalf of israel
32  the bones of joseph which the israelites had brought up out of egypt were buried in sheʹchem in the portion of the field that jacob had acquired from the sons of haʹmor sheʹchems father for 100 pieces of money and it became the inheritance of the sons of joseph
33  also eleaʹzar the son of aaron died
so they buried him in the hill of phinʹehas his son which had been given to him in the mountainous region of eʹphraim
5  as soon as all the kings of the amʹorites who were on the west side of the jordan and all the kings of the caʹnaanites who were by the sea heard that jehovah had dried up the waters of the jordan before the israelites until they had crossed over they lost heart and they lost all courage because of the israelites
2  at that time jehovah said to joshua make for yourself flint knives and circumcise the men of israel again a second time
3  so joshua made flint knives and circumcised the men of israel at gibʹeathhaarʹaloth
4  this is why joshua circumcised them all the males of the people who left egypt all the men of war had died in the wilderness on the journey after they left egypt
5  all the people who left egypt were circumcised but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey after they left egypt were not circumcised
6  the israelites had walked for 40 years in the wilderness until the entire nation had died off that is the men of war who left egypt who did not obey the voice of jehovah
jehovah swore to them that he would never let them see the land that jehovah had sworn to their forefathers to give to us a land flowing with milk and honey
7  so he raised up their sons instead of them
these joshua circumcised they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them during the journey
8  when they finished circumcising the entire nation they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered
9  then jehovah said to joshua today i have rolled away from you the reproach of egypt
so that place has been called gilʹgal until this day
10  the israelites continued to camp at gilʹgal and they observed the passover on the 14th day of the month in the evening on the desert plains of jerʹicho
11  and they began to eat the produce of the land the day after the passover unleavened bread and roasted grains on this same day
12  then the manna stopped on the day following when they had eaten some of the produce of the land there was no longer manna for the israelites but they began to eat the produce of the land of caʹnaan in that year
13  when joshua was near jerʹicho he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand
joshua walked up to him and asked are you on our side or on the side of our adversaries
14  to this he said no but i have come as prince of jehovahs army
with that joshua fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and said to him what does my lord have to say to his servant
15  the prince of jehovahs army replied to joshua remove your sandals from your feet because the place where you are standing is holy
at once joshua did so
15  the land allotted to the tribe of judah for their families extended to the boundary of eʹdom the wilderness of zin to the negʹeb at its southern end
2  their southern boundary ran from the extremity of the salt sea from the bay that faces southward
3  and it extended south to the ascent of akrabʹbim passed over to zin then went up from the south to kaʹdeshbarʹnea over to hezʹron up to adʹdar and went around toward karʹka
4  then it passed on to azʹmon and extended to the wadi of egypt and the boundary ended at the sea
this was their southern boundary
5  the eastern boundary was the salt sea up to the end of the jordan and the boundary at the northern corner was at the bay of the sea at the end of the jordan
6  the boundary went up to bethhogʹlah and passed over at the north of betharʹabah and the boundary went up to the stone of boʹhan the son of reuʹben
7  the boundary went up to deʹbir at the valley of aʹchor and turned northward to gilʹgal which is in front of the ascent of adumʹmim that is south of the wadi and the boundary passed over to the waters of ensheʹmesh and ended at enroʹgel
8  the boundary went up to the valley of the son of hinʹnom to the slope of the jebʹusite at the south that is jerusalem and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that faces the valley of hinʹnom to the west which is at the extremity of the valley of rephʹaim to the north
9  and the boundary was marked from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of nephtoʹah and extended to the cities of mount eʹphron and the boundary was marked to baʹalah that is kirʹiathjeʹarim
10  the boundary went around from baʹalah westward to mount seʹir and passed over to the slope of mount jeʹarim at the north that is chesʹalon and it went down to bethsheʹmesh and passed over to timʹnah
11  and the boundary extended to the slope of ekʹron to the north and the boundary was marked to shikʹkeron and passed over to mount baʹalah and extended to jabʹneel and the boundary ended at the sea
12  the western boundary was at the great sea and its coast
this was the boundary of the descendants of judah by their families on all sides
13  and to caʹleb the son of jephunʹneh he gave a share among the descendants of judah at the order of jehovah to joshua namely kirʹiatharʹba arʹba was the father of aʹnak that is hebʹron
14  so caʹleb drove out from there the three sons of aʹnak sheʹshai ahiʹman and talʹmai descendants of aʹnak
15  then he went up from there against the inhabitants of deʹbir
the name of deʹbir was previously kirʹiathseʹpher
16  caʹleb then said to the man who strikes kirʹiathseʹpher and captures it i will give my daughter achʹsah as a wife
17  and othʹniel the son of keʹnaz caʹlebs brother captured it
so he gave him his daughter achʹsah as a wife
18  while she was going home she urged him to ask her father for a field
then she dismounted from her donkey
caʹleb asked her what do you want
19  she said please grant me a blessing for you have given me a piece of land in the south give me also gulʹlothmaʹim
so he gave her upper gulʹloth and lower gulʹloth
20  this was the inheritance of the tribe of judah by their families
21  the cities at the extremity of the tribe of judah toward the boundary of eʹdom in the south were kabʹzeel eʹder jaʹgur
22  kiʹnah dimoʹnah adaʹdah

46  from ekʹron westward all that is alongside ashʹdod and their settlements

61  in the wilderness betharʹabah midʹdin secaʹcah
62  nibʹshan the city of salt and engedʹisix cities and their settlements
63  as for the jebʹusites who were dwelling in jerusalem the men of judah were not able to drive them away so the jebʹusites continue dwelling with the people of judah in jerusalem to this day
20  then jehovah said to joshua
2  tell the israelites select for yourselves the cities of refuge about which i spoke to you through moses
3  so that the manslayer who unintentionally or accidentally kills someone may flee there
and they will serve as a refuge for you from the avenger of blood
4  he must flee to one of these cities and stand at the entrance of the city gate and present his case in the hearing of the elders of that city
then they must receive him into the city and give him a place and he will live with them
5  if the avenger of blood chases after him they should not surrender the manslayer into his hand for he killed his fellow man accidentally and he did not previously hate him
6  he must dwell in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and remain there until the death of the high priest who is in office at that time
then the manslayer may return to the city from which he fled and he may enter his city and his house
7  so they gave a sacred status to keʹdesh in galʹilee in the mountainous region of naphʹtali sheʹchem in the mountainous region of eʹphraim and kirʹiatharʹba that is hebʹron in the mountainous region of judah
8  in the region of the jordan east of jerʹicho they selected beʹzer in the wilderness on the tableland out of the tribe of reuʹben raʹmoth in gilʹead out of the tribe of gad and goʹlan in baʹshan out of the tribe of manasʹseh
9  these became the cities appointed for all the israelites and for the foreign residents residing among them so that anyone who unintentionally killed someone could flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly
1  after the death of moses the servant of jehovah jehovah said to joshua the son of nun the minister of moses
2  moses my servant is dead
now get up cross the jordan you and all this people and go into the land that i am giving to them to the people of israel
3  i will give you every place on which you set your foot just as i promised moses
4  your territory will extend from the wilderness up to lebʹanon and to the great river the euphraʹtesall the land of the hitʹtitesand to the great sea on the west
5  no one will be able to take a stand against you as long as you live
just as i was with moses so i will be with you
i will neither desert you nor abandon you
6  be courageous and strong for you are the one who will cause this people to inherit the land that i swore to their forefathers i would give to them
7  only be courageous and very strong and observe carefully the entire law that moses my servant commanded you
do not deviate from it either to the right or to the left so that you may act wisely wherever you go
8  this book of the law should not depart from your mouth and you must read it in an undertone day and night in order to observe carefully all that is written in it for then your way will be successful and then you will act wisely
9  have i not commanded you be courageous and strong
do not be struck with terror or fear for jehovah your god is with you wherever you go
10  then joshua commanded the officers of the people
11  pass throughout the camp and give this command to the people get provisions ready because in three days you will cross the jordan to go in and take possession of the land that jehovah your god is giving you to possess
12  and to the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh joshua said
13  remember what moses the servant of jehovah commanded you jehovah your god is giving you rest and has given you this land
14  your wives your children and your livestock will dwell in the land that moses has given you on this side of the jordan but all you mighty warriors should cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers
you must help them
15  until jehovah gives your brothers rest just as he has given you and they also take possession of the land that jehovah your god is giving them
then return to the land you were given to occupy and take possession of it the land that moses the servant of jehovah gave you on the east side of the jordan
16  they answered joshua we will do all that you have commanded and we will go wherever you send us
17  just as we listened to everything moses said so we will listen to you
only may jehovah your god be with you just as he was with moses
18  any man who rebels against your order and does not obey every command you give him will be put to death
only be courageous and strong
2  then joshua the son of nun secretly sent two men out from shitʹtim as spies
he told them go and inspect the land especially jerʹicho
so they went and came to the house of a prostitute named raʹhab and they stayed there
2  the king of jerʹicho was told look israelite men have come in here tonight to spy out the land
3  at that the king of jerʹicho sent word to raʹhab bring out the men who came and are staying in your house for they have come to spy out the entire land
4  but the woman took the two men and hid them
then she said yes the men came to me but i did not know where they were from
5  and at dark when the city gate was about to be closed the men went out
i do not know where the men went but if you quickly chase after them you will catch up with them
6  however she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them among stalks of flax laid in rows on the roof
7  so the men chased after them in the direction of the jordan at the fords and the city gate was shut once the pursuers had gone out
8  before the men lay down to sleep she came up to them on the roof
9  she said to the men i do know that jehovah will give you the land and that the fear of you has fallen upon us
all the inhabitants of the land are disheartened because of you
10  for we heard how jehovah dried up the waters of the red sea before you when you left egypt and what you did to the two kings of the amʹorites siʹhon and og whom you devoted to destruction on the other side of the jordan
11  when we heard about it we lost heart and no one has any courage because of you for jehovah your god is god in the heavens above and on the earth beneath
12  now please swear to me by jehovah that because i showed loyal love to you you will also show loyal love to my fathers household and you must give me a sign of good faith
13  you must spare the lives of my father and mother my brothers and sisters and all who belong to them and you must save us from death
14  at that the men said to her we will give our lives for yours if you do not tell about our mission then we will show loyal love and faithfulness toward you when jehovah gives us the land
15  after that she let them down by a rope through the window for her house was on a side of the city wall
in fact she was dwelling on the wall
16  then she said to them go to the mountainous region and hide there for three days so that those pursuing you may not find you
then after your pursuers have come back you can go on your way
17  the men said to her we will be free from guilt respecting this oath that you made us swear
18  unless when we come into the land you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window by which you let us down
you should gather your father your mother your brothers and all your fathers household with you into the house
19  then if anyone goes out the doors of your house into the open his blood will be on his own head and we will be free from guilt
but if harm comes to anyone who remains with you in the house his blood will be on our heads
20  but if you report our mission we will be free from guilt respecting your oath that you made us swear
21  she replied let it be according to your words
with that she sent them off and they went their way
afterward she tied the scarlet cord in the window
22  so they left and went to the mountainous region and stayed there for three days until the pursuers returned
the pursuers had been looking for them on every road but did not find them
23  the two men then descended from the mountainous region and crossed the river and came to joshua the son of nun
they related to him all the things that had happened to them
24  then they said to joshua jehovah has handed over the entire land to us
in fact all the inhabitants of the land are disheartened because of us
3  then joshua got up early in the morning and he and all the israelites departed from shitʹtim and came to the jordan
they spent the night there before crossing over
2  after three days the officers passed throughout the camp
3  and commanded the people as soon as you see the ark of the covenant of jehovah your god being carried by the levitical priests you should depart from your place and follow it
4  but keep a distance of about 2000 cubits from it do not come any nearer to it so that you may know which is the way to go for you have not traveled on this way before
5  joshua now said to the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow jehovah will do wonderful things among you
6  then joshua said to the priests take up the ark of the covenant and pass ahead of the people
so they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people
7  then jehovah said to joshua this day i will start to exalt you in the eyes of all israel so that they may know that i will be with you just as i was with moses
8  you should give this command to the priests carrying the ark of the covenant when you reach the edge of the waters of the jordan you should stand still in the jordan
9  and joshua said to the israelites come here and listen to the words of jehovah your god
10  joshua then said by this you will know that a living god is among you and that he will without fail drive away from before you the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the hiʹvites the perʹizzites the girʹgashites the amʹorites and the jebʹusites
11  look the ark of the covenant of the lord of the whole earth is passing ahead of you into the jordan
12  now take 12 men from the tribes of israel one man for each tribe
13  and as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of jehovah the lord of the whole earth touch the waters of the jordan the waters of the jordan flowing from upstream will be halted and they will stand still like a dam
14  so when the people departed from their tents just before crossing the jordan the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of the people
15  as soon as the carriers of the ark reached the jordan and the priests carrying the ark dipped their feet into the edge of the waters now the jordan overflows its banks all the days of harvest
16  the waters flowing from upstream stood still
they rose up like a dam very far away at adam the city near zarʹethan while the waters descending toward the sea of the arʹabah the salt sea drained away
they were halted and the people crossed over opposite jerʹicho
17  while the priests carrying the ark of jehovahs covenant kept standing still on dry ground in the middle of the jordan all israel crossed over on dry ground until the whole nation had finished crossing the jordan
12  now these are the kings of the land whom the israelites defeated whose land they took possession of on the east side of the jordan from the arʹnon valley up to mount herʹmon and all the arʹabah toward the east

5  and ruled in mount herʹmon in salʹecah and in all baʹshan as far as the boundary of the geshʹurites and the maacʹathites and half of gilʹead to the territory of king siʹhon of heshʹbon
6  moses the servant of jehovah and the israelites defeated them after which moses the servant of jehovah gave their land as a possession to the reuʹbenites the gadʹites and the half tribe of manasʹseh
