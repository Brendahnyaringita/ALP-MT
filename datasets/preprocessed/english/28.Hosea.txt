10  israel is a degenerate vine yielding its fruit
the more his fruit increases the more he multiplies his altarsthe better his land produces the more splendid his sacred pillars
2  their heart is hypocriticalnow they will be found guilty
there is one who will break their altars and destroy their pillars
3  now they will say we have no king for we have not feared jehovah
and what could a king do for us
4  they speak empty words make false oaths and make covenantsso the judgment that springs up is like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field
5  the residents of samarʹia will fear for the calf idol of bethaʹven
its people will mourn over itas will its foreigngod priests who rejoiced over it and its gloryfor it will go away from them into exile
6  it will be brought to assyrʹia as a gift to a great king
eʹphraim will be put to shameand israel will be ashamed because of the advice it followed
7  samarʹia and her king will certainly be done away withlike a snappedoff twig on the surface of waters
8  the high places of bethaʹven the sin of israel will be annihilated
thorns and thistles will grow on their altars
people will say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fall over us
9  from the days of gibʹeah you have sinned o israel
there they have persisted
war did not overtake the sons of unrighteousness in gibʹeah
10  i will also discipline them when i please
and peoples will be gathered against themwhen their two errors are harnessed on them
11  eʹphraim was a trained heifer that loved to threshso i spared her fair neck
now i will make someone ride eʹphraim
judah will plow jacob will harrow for him
12  sow seed for yourselves in righteousness and reap loyal love
plow for yourselves arable landwhile there is time to search for jehovahuntil he comes and instructs you in righteousness
13  but you have plowed wickednessyou have reaped unrighteousnessand you have eaten the fruitage of deceptionfor you have trusted in your own wayin the multitude of your warriors
14  an uproar will rise against your peopleand your fortified cities will all be devastatedlike the devastation by shalʹman of the house of arʹbelin the day of battle when mothers were dashed to pieces alongside their children
15  this is what will be done to you o bethʹel because of your utter wickedness
at dawn the king of israel will surely be done away with
4  hear the word of jehovah o people of israelfor jehovah has a legal case against the inhabitants of the landbecause there is no truth nor loyal love nor knowledge of god in the land
2  false oaths and lying and murderand stealing and adultery are widespreadand one act of bloodshed follows another act of bloodshed
3  that is why the land will mournand every inhabitant in it will waste awaythe wild animals of the field and the birds of the heavenseven the fish of the sea will perish
4  however let no man contend or reprovefor your people are like those who contend against a priest
5  so you will stumble in broad daylightand the prophet will stumble with you as if it were night
and i will silence your mother
6  my people will be silenced because there is no knowledge
because you have rejected knowledgei will also reject you from serving as my priestand because you have forgotten the law of your godi myself will forget your sons
7  the more they increased the more they sinned against me
i will change their glory into disgrace
8  they feed on the sin of my peopleand they are greedy for their error
9  it will be the same for the people as for the priesti will call them to account for their waysand i will bring on them the consequences of their actions
10  they will eat but not be satisfied
they will be promiscuous but they will not increasebecause they have shown no regard for jehovah
11  prostitution and wine and new winetake away the motivation to do what is right
12  my people consult their wooden idolsdoing what their staff tells thembecause the spirit of prostitution causes them to go astrayand by their prostitution they refuse to submit to their god
13  on the tops of the mountains they sacrificeand on the hills they make sacrifices smokeunder oak trees and storax trees and every big treebecause their shade is good
that is why your daughters commit prostitutionand your daughtersinlaw commit adultery
14  i will not hold an accounting against your daughters because of their prostitutionand against your daughtersinlaw because of their adultery
for the men go off with the harlotsand sacrifice with the temple prostitutessuch a people without understanding will come to ruin
15  although you are committing prostitution o israellet not judah become guilty
do not come to gilʹgal or to bethaʹvenand do not swear as surely as jehovah is alive
16  for like a stubborn cow israel has become stubborn
will jehovah now shepherd them like a young ram in an open pasture
17  eʹphraim is joined to idols
let him alone
18  when their beer is finishedthey become promiscuous
and her rulers dearly love dishonor
19  the wind will wrap her in its wingsand they will be ashamed of their sacrifices
11  when israel was a boy i loved himand out of egypt i called my son
2  the more they called themthe more they went away from them
they kept sacrificing to the baʹal imagesand offering sacrifices to the graven images
3  but it was i who taught eʹphraim to walk taking them in my armsand they did not acknowledge that i had healed them
4  with the ropes of men i kept drawing them with the cords of loveand i was to them like one lifting a yoke from their jawsand i gently brought food to each one
5  they will not return to the land of egypt but assyrʹia will be their kingbecause they refused to return to me
6  and a sword will whirl against his citiesand destroy his bars and devour them because of their schemes
7  my people are bent on unfaithfulness to me
though they called them upward no one rises up
8  how can i give you up o eʹphraim how can i hand you over o israel how can i treat you like adʹmah how can i make you like zeboiʹim i have had a change of heartat the same time my compassions are stirred
9  i will not vent my burning anger
i will not destroy eʹphraim againfor i am god and not manthe holy one in your midstand i will not come against you in fury
10  they will walk after jehovah and he will roar like a lionwhen he roars his sons will come trembling from the west
11  they will tremble like a bird when they come out of egyptlike a dove out of the land of assyrʹiaand i will settle them in their houses declares jehovah
12  eʹphraim has surrounded me with liesand the house of israel with deceit
but judah still roams with godand he is faithful to the most holy one
8  put a horn to your mouth one comes like an eagle against the house of jehovahfor they have violated my covenant and transgressed against my law
2  to me they cry out my god we israel know you
3  israel has rejected what is good
let an enemy pursue him
4  they have appointed kings but not through me
they have appointed princes but i did not recognize them
with their silver and their gold they have made idolsto their own destruction
5  your calf has been rejected o samarʹia
my anger flares up against them
how long will they be incapable of innocence
6  for this is from israel
a craftsman made it and it is not godthe calf of samarʹia will be reduced to splinters
7  for it is wind that they are sowingand they will reap a storm wind
no stalk produces ripe grainwhatever sprouts produces no flour
if any is produced foreigners will swallow it down
8  israel will be swallowed down
now they will be among the nationslike an unwanted vessel
9  for they have gone up to assyrʹia like a lone wild donkey
eʹphraim has hired lovers
10  although they hire them from among the nationsi will now round them upthey will begin to suffer because of the burden imposed by king and princes
11  for eʹphraim has multiplied altars to sin
they became his altars for sinning
12  i wrote for him the many things of my lawbut they were regarded as something strange
13  they offer sacrificial gifts to me and they eat the meatbut jehovah takes no pleasure in them
now he will remember their error and punish them for their sins
they have turned back to egypt
14  israel has forgotten his maker and has built templesand judah has multiplied fortified cities
but i will send fire into his citiesand it will consume the towers of each one
9  do not rejoice o israeldo not act joyfully like the peoples
for by prostitution you have strayed from your god
you have loved the wages of a prostitute on every threshing floor of grain
2  but the threshing floor and winepress will not feed themand new wine will fail her
3  they will not continue dwelling in the land of jehovahinstead eʹphraim will return to egyptand in assyrʹia they will eat what is unclean
4  they will no longer pour out wine offerings to jehovahtheir sacrifices will not please him
they are like the bread of mourningall those eating it will defile themselves
for their bread is for themselves aloneit will not come into the house of jehovah
5  what will you do in the day of meetingin the day of jehovahs festival
6  for look they will have to flee because of destruction
egypt will gather them together and memʹphis will bury them
nettles will take possession of their precious things of silverand thornbushes will be in their tents
7  the days of reckoning will comethe days of retribution will comeand israel will know it
their prophet will be a fool and the man of inspiration will go madbecause your error is abundant the animosity against you is abundant
8  the watchman of eʹphraim was with my god
but now all the ways of his prophets are as the traps of a birdcatcherthere is animosity in the house of his god
9  they have sunk deep into ruin as in the days of gibʹeah
he will remember their error and punish their sins
10  like grapes in the wilderness i found israel
like the first of the early figs on a fig tree i saw your forefathers
but they went to baʹal of peʹorthey dedicated themselves to the shameful thingand they became disgusting like the object of their love
11  eʹphraims glory flies away like a birdthere is no giving birth no pregnancy and no conception
12  even if they raise childreni will bereave them until no man is leftyes woe to them when i turn away from them
13  eʹphraim planted in a pasture was to me like tyrenow eʹphraim must bring his sons out to the slaughter
14  give them o jehovah what you should give thema womb that miscarries and dry breasts
15  all their wickedness was in gilʹgal for there i came to hate them
i will drive them away from my house because of their evil deeds
i will no longer love themall their princes are stubborn
16  eʹphraim will be struck down
their root will dry up and they will produce no fruit
even if they give birth i will put to death their cherished offspring
17  my god will reject themfor they have not listened to himand they will become fugitives among the nations
7  at the time when i would heal israelthe error of eʹphraim is also exposedand the wickedness of samarʹia
for they practice deceptionthieves break in and marauder bands raid outside
2  but they do not say in their heart that i will remember all their wickedness
now their dealings are all around themthey are right in front of my face
3  they make the king rejoice by their wickednessand princes by their deceit
4  all of them are adulterersburning like an oven fired by a bakerwho stops stirring the fire after kneading the dough until it is leavened
5  on the day of our king princes have become sickthey are enraged because of wine
he has reached out his hand to ridiculers
6  for they approach with hearts burning like an oven
all night long the baker sleepsin the morning the oven blazes like a flaming fire
7  all of them are hot like an ovenand they devour their rulers
all their kings have fallenno one among them calls out to me
8  eʹphraim mixes with the nations
eʹphraim is like a round cake left unturned
9  strangers have consumed his strength but he does not know it
and his gray hairs have turned white but he does not notice it
10  the pride of israel has testified against himbut they have not returned to jehovah their godnor have they looked for him despite all of this
11  eʹphraim is like a simpleminded dove lacking good sense
they have called out to egypt they have gone to assyrʹia
12  wherever they go i will spread my net over them
i will bring them down like the birds of the heavens
i will discipline them according to the warning given to their assembly
13  woe to them for they have fled from me devastation to them for they have transgressed against me i was ready to redeem them but they have spoken lies against me
14  from their heart they did not call to me for helpalthough they kept wailing on their beds
for their grain and new wine they would slash themselvesthey turn against me
15  although i disciplined them and strengthened their armsthey are against me scheming what is bad
16  they changed course but not to anything loftierthey were as unreliable as a loose bow
their princes will fall by the sword because of their defiant tongues
for this they will be an object of ridicule in the land of egypt
6  come and let us return to jehovahfor he has torn us to pieces but he will heal us
he struck us but he will bind our wounds
2  he will revive us after two days
on the third day he will raise us upand we will live before him
3  we will know we will earnestly seek to know jehovah
his going out is as certain as the dawnhe will come to us like a pouring rainlike a spring rain that saturates the earth
4  what should i do with you eʹphraim what should i do with you judah for your loyal love is like the morning cloudslike the dew that quickly vanishes
5  that is why i will cut them down by means of the prophetsi will kill them with the words of my mouth
and the judgments on you will shine as the light
6  for in loyal love i delight not in sacrificeand in the knowledge of god rather than in whole burnt offerings
7  but they like mere men have violated the covenant
there they have betrayed me
8  gilʹead is a town of evildoerscovered with footprints of blood
9  the company of priests are like marauder bands lying in ambush for a man
they murder on the road at sheʹchemfor their conduct is shameful
10  i have seen a horrible thing in the house of israel
there eʹphraim practices prostitutionisrael has defiled itself
11  furthermore o judah a harvest is set for youwhen i gather back the captives of my people
13  when eʹphraim spoke there was tremblinghe was prominent in israel
but he became guilty with regard to baʹal and died
2  now they add to their sinand make metal statues from their silverthey skillfully make idols all the work of craftsmen
to them they say let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves
3  so they will become like the morning cloudslike the dew that vanishes earlylike chaff blown from the threshing floor by a stormand like smoke out of the hole in the roof
4  but i am jehovah your god from the land of egyptyou knew no god except meand besides me there is no savior
5  i knew you in the wilderness in the land of drought
6  they were satisfied with their pasturesthey were satisfied and their heart became proud
and so they forgot me
7  i will become like a young lion to themlike a leopard lurking along the path
8  i will come upon them like a bear that has lost its cubsand i will rip open their chest
i will devour them there like a liona wild beast of the field will tear them to pieces
9  it will destroy you o israelbecause you turned against me against your helper
10  where then is your king that he may save you in all your citiesand your rulers of whom you saidgive me a king and princes
11  i gave you a king in my angerand i will take him away in my fury
12  the error of eʹphraim is wrapped uphis sin is stored up
13  the pangs of childbirth will come for him
but he is an unwise childhe does not present himself when it is time to be born
14  from the power of the grave i will redeem themfrom death i will recover them
where are your stings o death where is your destructiveness o grave compassion will be concealed from my eyes
15  even if he should flourish among the reedsan east wind will come the wind of jehovahfrom the desert it comes to dry up his well and drain his spring
that one will pillage the treasury of all his precious things
16  samarʹia will be held guilty for she has rebelled against her god
by the sword they will falltheir children will be dashed to piecesand their pregnant women will be ripped open
14  come back o israel to jehovah your godfor you have stumbled because of your error
2  come back to jehovah with these wordssay to him may you pardon our error and accept what is goodand we will offer the praise of our lips as we would young bulls
3  assyrʹia will not save us
we will not ride on horsesand we will no longer say o our god to the work of our handsfor it is by you that the fatherless child is shown mercy
4  i will heal their unfaithfulness
i will love them of my own free willbecause my anger has turned away from him
5  i will become like the dew to israelhe will blossom like the lilyand will send down his roots like the trees of lebʹanon
6  his twigs will spreadhis splendor will be like that of the olive treeand his fragrance like that of lebʹanon
7  they will again dwell in his shadow
they will grow grain and will bud like the vine
his fame will be like the wine of lebʹanon
8  eʹphraim will say what more do i have to do with idols i will answer and watch over him
i will be like a thriving juniper tree
from me your fruit will be found
9  who is wise let him understand these things
who is discreet let him know them
for the ways of jehovah are uprightand the righteous will walk in thembut the transgressors will stumble in them
5  hear this you priestspay attention o house of israellisten o house of the kingfor the judgment involves youbecause you are a trap to mizʹpahand a net spread over taʹbor
2  and those falling away have sunk deep in slaughterand i am warning all of them
3  i know eʹphraimand israel is not hidden from me
for now o eʹphraim you have acted promiscuouslyisrael has defiled itself
4  their dealings do not permit them to return to their godbecause there is a spirit of prostitution among themand jehovah they do not acknowledge
5  the pride of israel has testified against himboth israel and eʹphraim have stumbled in their errorand judah has stumbled with them
6  with their flock and their herd they went to look for jehovahbut they could not find him
he had drawn away from them
7  they have betrayed jehovahfor they have fathered foreign sons
now a month will devour them and their portions
8  blow a horn in gibʹeah a trumpet in raʹmah shout a war cry at bethaʹvenafter you o benjamin
9  o eʹphraim you will become an object of horror in the day of punishment
i have made known what will surely happen among the tribes of israel
10  the princes of judah are like those moving a boundary
i will pour out my fury on them like water
11  eʹphraim is oppressed crushed by judgmentfor he was determined to follow after his adversary
12  so i was like a moth to eʹphraimand like rottenness to the house of judah
13  when eʹphraim saw his sickness and judah his ulcereʹphraim went to assyrʹia and sent to a great king
but he was unable to heal youand he could not cure your ulcer
14  for i will be like a young lion to eʹphraimand like a strong lion to the house of judah
i myself will tear to pieces and go awayi will carry them off and no one will rescue them
15  i will go away and return to my place until they bear the consequences of their guiltand then they will seek my favor
when they are in distress they will seek me
1  the word of jehovah that came to hoseʹa the son of beeʹri in the days of uzziʹah joʹtham aʹhaz and hezekiʹah kings of judah and in the days of jeroboʹam son of joʹash the king of israel
2  when jehovah started to speak his word through hoseʹa jehovah said to hoseʹa go marry a woman of prostitution and have children of prostitution because by prostitution the land has turned completely away from following jehovah
3  so he went and married goʹmer the daughter of diblaʹim and she conceived and bore him a son
4  then jehovah said to him name him jezʹreel for in a little while i will hold an accounting against the house of jeʹhu for the acts of bloodshed of jezʹreel and i will put an end to the royal rule of the house of israel
5  in that day i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezʹreel
6  she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter
and he told him name her loruhaʹmah for i will no longer show mercy to the house of israel because i will certainly drive them away
7  but i will show mercy to the house of judah and i will save them by jehovah their god i will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen
8  after weaning loruhaʹmah she conceived and gave birth to a son
9  then he said name him loamʹmi because you are not my people and i will not be yours
10  and the number of the people of israel will be like the grains of sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered
and in the place where it was said to them you are not my people it will be said to them the sons of the living god
11  and the people of judah and of israel will be gathered together into unity and will choose for themselves one head and go up out of the land for great will be the day of jezʹreel
2  say to your brothers my people and to your sisters o woman shown mercy
2  accuse your mother accuse herfor she is not my wife and i am not her husband
she should remove her prostitution from herselfand her adultery from between her breasts
3  or i will strip her naked and make her as in the day she was bornmaking her like a wildernessreducing her to a waterless landand causing her to die of thirst
4  and to her sons i will not show mercyfor they are the sons of prostitution
5  for their mother has committed prostitution
she who was pregnant with them has acted shamefully for she saidi will go after my passionate loversthose who give me my bread and my watermy wool and my linen my oil and my drink
6  so i will block your way with a hedge of thornsand i will raise up a stone wall against herso that she cannot find her paths
7  she will chase after her passionate lovers but she will not overtake themshe will look for them but she will not find them
then she will say i will go back to my first husbandfor i was better off at that time than i am now
8  she did not recognize that it was i who had given her the grain the new wine and the oiland i who had given her silver in abundanceand gold which they used for baʹal
9  therefore i will return and take away my grain in its timeand my new wine in its seasonand i will snatch away my wool and my linen that were to cover her nakedness
10  now i will expose her private parts in full view of her passionate loversand no man will rescue her out of my hand
11  i will put an end to all her joyher festivals her new moons her sabbaths and all her festive seasons
12  and i will ruin her vines and her fig trees of which she has said these are my wages which my passionate lovers gave to mei will turn them into a forestand the wild animals of the field will devour them
13  i will hold an accounting against her for the days when she offered sacrifices to the baʹal imageswhen she would adorn herself with her rings and ornaments and would chase after her passionate loversand i was the one she forgot declares jehovah
14  so i will persuade heri will lead her into the wildernessand i will speak to win her heart
15  i will give her vineyards back to her from that time onwardand the valley of aʹchor as a gateway to hopeshe will answer there as in the days of her youthas in the day when she came out of the land of egypt
16  and in that day declares jehovahyou will call me my husband and you will no longer call me my master
17  i will remove the names of the baʹal images from her mouthand they will no longer be remembered by their name
18  in that day i will make a covenant for them with the wild animals of the fieldand with the birds of the heavens and the creeping things of the groundi will rid the land of the bow and the sword and warand i will make them lie down in security
19  i will engage myself to you foreverand i will engage myself to you in righteousness and in justicein loyal love and in mercy
20  i will engage myself to you in faithfulnessand you will certainly know jehovah
21  in that day i will answer declares jehovahi will answer the heavensand they will answer the earth
22  and the earth will answer the grain and the new wine and the oiland they will answer jezʹreel
23  i will sow her like seed for myself in the earthand i will show mercy to her who was not shown mercyi will say to those not my people you are my people and they will say you are my god
3  then jehovah said to me go once again love the woman who is loved by another man and is committing adultery just as jehovah loves the people of israel while they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes
2  so i purchased her for myself for 15 silver pieces and a hoʹmer measure and a half of barley
3  then i said to her you will remain mine for many days
you must not commit prostitution and you must not have relations with another man and i will behave the same way toward you
4  it is because for a long time the people of israel will dwell without a king without a prince without a sacrifice without a pillar and without an ephʹod and teraphim statues
5  afterward the people of israel will come back and look for jehovah their god and for david their king and they will come trembling to jehovah and to his goodness in the final part of the days
12  eʹphraim is feeding on wind
he chases after the east wind all day long
he multiplies lies and violence
they make a covenant with assyrʹia and take oil to egypt
2  jehovah has a legal case against judahhe will call for an accounting against jacob according to his waysand he will repay him according to his deeds
3  in the womb he seized his brother by the heeland with his vigor he contended with god
4  he kept contending with an angel and prevailed
he wept and begged for his favor
he found him at bethʹel and there he spoke with us
5  jehovah the god of armiesjehovah is his memorial name
6  so return to your godmaintain loyal love and justiceand always hope in your god
7  but in the hand of the tradesman are deceptive scaleshe loves to defraud
8  eʹphraim keeps saying indeed i have become richi have found wealth
and in all my toil they will not find anything wrong or sinful
9  but i am jehovah your god from the land of egypt
i will again make you dwell in tentsas in the days of an appointed time
10  i spoke to the prophetsi multiplied their visionsand i spoke parables through the prophets
11  with gilʹead there has been deception and untruth
in gilʹgal they have sacrificed bullsand their altars are like piles of stones in the furrows of the field
12  jacob ran away to the territory of aʹramisrael served there for a wifeand for a wife he guarded sheep
13  by a prophet jehovah brought israel up from egyptand by a prophet he was guarded
14  eʹphraim has caused bitter offensehis bloodguilt remains on himhis lord will repay him for his reproach
