10  why o jehovah do you stand at a distance why do you hide yourself in times of distress
2  the wicked one arrogantly pursues the helpless onebut he will be caught in the schemes he devises
3  for the wicked one boasts about his selfish desiresand blesses the greedy oneנ nunhe disrespects jehovah
4  in his haughtiness the wicked man makes no investigationall his thoughts are there is no god
5  his ways keep prosperingbut your judgments are beyond his understandinghe scoffs at all his adversaries
6  he says in his heart i will never be shakenfor generation after generationi will never see calamity
7  his mouth is full of curses lies and threatsunder his tongue are trouble and injury
8  he waits in ambush near the settlementsfrom his hiding place he kills an innocent one
ע ayin his eyes are watching for an unfortunate victim
9  he waits in his hiding place like a lion in its lair
he waits to seize the helpless one
he seizes the helpless one when he pulls his net shut
10  the victim is crushed and brought downthe unfortunate ones fall into his clutches
11  he says in his heart god has forgotten
he has turned away his face
he never notices
12  rise up o jehovah
o god lift up your hand
do not forget the helpless ones
13  why has the wicked one disrespected god he says in his heart you will not hold me accountable
14  but you do see trouble and distress
you look on and take matters in hand
to you the unfortunate victim turnsyou are the helper for the fatherless child
15  break the arm of the wicked and evil manso that when you search for his wickednessyou will find it no more
16  jehovah is king forever and ever
the nations have perished from the earth
17  but you will hear the request of the meek o jehovah
you will make their hearts firm and pay close attention to them
18  you will render justice to the fatherless and to those who are crushedso that mortal man of the earth may no longer make them afraid

6  i will wash my hands in innocenceand i will march around your altar o jehovah
7  to cause the sound of thanksgiving to be heardand to declare all your wonderful works
8  jehovah i love the house where you dwellthe place where your glory resides
9  do not sweep me away with sinnersnor take my life away with violent men

12  my foot is standing on level groundin the great congregation i will praise jehovah
11  in jehovah i have taken refuge
so how can you say to me flee like a bird to your mountain
2  see how the wicked bend the bowthey set their arrow on the bowstringto shoot from the darkness those upright in heart
3  when the foundations are torn downwhat can the righteous do
4  jehovah is in his holy temple
jehovahs throne is in the heavens
his own eyes see his watchful eyes examine the sons of men
5  jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked onehe hates anyone who loves violence
6  upon the wicked he will rain down snaresfire and sulfur and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup
7  for jehovah is righteous he loves righteous acts
the upright will see his face
132  o jehovah remember davidand all his suffering
2  how he swore to jehovahhow he vowed to the powerful one of jacob
3  i will not go into my tent my home
i will not lie upon my couch my bed
4  i will not allow my eyes to sleepnor my eyelids to slumber
5  until i find a place for jehovaha fine residence for the powerful one of jacob
6  look we heard about it in ephʹrathahwe found it in the fields of the forest
7  let us come into his residencelet us bow down at his footstool
8  rise up o jehovah to come to your restingplaceyou and the ark of your strength
9  may your priests be clothed with righteousnessand may your loyal ones shout joyfully
10  for the sake of david your servantdo not reject your anointed one
11  jehovah has sworn to davidhe will surely not go back on his word one of your offspringi will place on your throne
12  if your sons keep my covenantand my reminders that i teach themtheir sons toowill sit on your throne forever
13  for jehovah has chosen zionhe has desired it for his dwelling place
14  this is my restingplace foreverhere i will dwell for this is my desire
15  i will richly bless it with provisionsi will satisfy its poor with bread
16  its priests i will clothe with salvationand its loyal ones will shout joyfully
17  there i will make the strength of david grow
i have prepared a lamp for my anointed one
18  i will clothe his enemies with shamebut the crown on his head will flourish
49  hear this all you peoples
pay attention all you inhabitants of the world
2  both small and greatrich and poor alike
3  my own mouth will speak wisdomand the meditation of my heart will show understanding
4  i will pay attention to a proverbi will expound my riddle with the harp
5  why should i fear during times of troublewhen i am surrounded by the evil of those trying to overthrow me
6  those who are trusting in their wealthand who boast about their great riches
7  none of them can ever redeem a brotheror give to god a ransom for him
8  the ransom price for their life is so preciousthat it is always beyond their reach
9  that he should live forever and not see the pit
10  he sees that even wise people diethe stupid and the unreasoning perish togetherand they must leave their wealth to others
11  their inner wish is that their houses will last forevertheir tents to generation after generation
they have named their estates after themselves
12  but man although honored will not remainhe is no better than the beasts that perish
13  this is the way of the stupid onesand of those who follow them who take pleasure in their empty words
selah
14  they are assigned like sheep to the grave
death will shepherd themthe upright will rule over them in the morning
every trace of them will fade awaythe grave rather than a palace will be their home
15  but god will redeem me from the power of the gravefor he will take hold of me
selah
16  do not be afraid because a man becomes richbecause the splendor of his house increases
17  for when he dies he can take nothing with himhis splendor will not go down with him
18  for during his lifetime he congratulates himself
people praise you when you prosper
19  but he finally joins the generation of his forefathers
they will never again see the light
20  a man who does not understand this although honoredis no better than the beasts that perish
125  those who trust in jehovahare like mount zion which cannot be shakenbut endures forever
2  just as mountains surround jerusalemso jehovah surrounds his peoplefrom now on and forever
3  the scepter of wickedness will not remain upon the land allotted to the righteousso that the righteous do not turn to doing what is wrong
4  do good o jehovah to those who are goodto those who are upright in heart
5  as for those who turn aside to their crooked waysjehovah will remove them along with the wrongdoers
may there be peace upon israel

3  how long will the wicked o jehovahhow long will the wicked continue to exult
4  they babble and speak arrogantlyall the wrongdoers brag about themselves
5  they crush your people o jehovahand oppress your inheritance
6  they kill the widow and the foreign residentand they murder the fatherless children
7  they say jah does not seethe god of jacob does not take notice of it
8  understand this you who are unreasoningyou foolish ones when will you ever show insight
9  the one who made the ear can he not hear the one who formed the eye can he not see
10  the one correcting the nations can he not reprove he is the one who imparts knowledge to people
11  jehovah knows the thoughts of menthat they are but a mere breath
12  happy is the man whom you correct o jahwhom you teach from your law
13  to give him tranquillity during days of calamityuntil a pit is dug for the wicked
14  for jehovah will not forsake his peoplenor will he abandon his inheritance
15  for judgment will once again be righteousand all the upright in heart will follow it
16  who will rise up for me against the wicked who will take a stand for me against the wrongdoers
17  if jehovah had not been my helperi would soon have perished
18  when i said my foot is slipping your loyal love o jehovah kept supporting me
19  when anxieties overwhelmed meyou comforted and soothed me
20  can a throne of corruption be allied with youwhile it is framing trouble in the name of the law
21  they make vicious attacks on the righteous oneand condemn the innocent one to death
22  but jehovah will become a secure refuge for memy god is my rock of refuge
23  he will make their wicked deeds come back upon them
he will do away with them by means of their own evil
jehovah our god will do away with them
147  praise jah it is good to sing praises to our godhow pleasant and fitting it is to praise him
2  jehovah is building jerusalemhe gathers together the dispersed ones of israel
3  he heals the brokenheartedhe binds up their wounds
4  he counts the number of the starshe calls all of them by name
5  our lord is great and is mighty in powerhis understanding is beyond measure
6  jehovah raises up the meekbut he hurls the wicked to the ground
7  sing to jehovah with thanksgivingsing praises to our god accompanied by the harp
8  the one who covers the heavens with cloudsthe one providing rain for the earththe one making grass sprout on the mountains
9  to the animals he gives foodto the young ravens that call out for it
10  he does not delight in the power of the horsenor is he impressed by the strong legs of a man
11  jehovah finds pleasure in those who fear himin those waiting for his loyal love
12  glorify jehovah o jerusalem
praise your god o zion
13  he makes the bars of your city gates stronghe blesses your sons within you
14  he brings peace to your territoryhe satisfies you with the finest wheat
15  he sends his command to the earthhis word runs swiftly
16  he sends the snow like woolhe scatters the frost just like ashes
17  he hurls down his hailstones like morsels of bread
who can withstand his cold
18  he sends out his word and they melt
he makes his wind blow and the waters flow
19  he declares his word to jacobhis regulations and judgments to israel
20  he has not done so with any other nationthey know nothing about his judgments
praise jah
64  hear my voice o god as i plead
safeguard my life from the dreadfulness of the enemy
2  shield me from the secret plots of wicked menfrom the crowd of wrongdoers
3  they sharpen their tongue just like a swordthey aim their cruel words like arrows
4  to shoot at the innocent from their hiding placesthey shoot at him suddenly without fear
5  they hold fast to their evil intentthey discuss how to hide their traps
they say who will see them
6  they search out new ways of wrongdoingthey secretly devise their shrewd strategythe thinking within each ones heart is unfathomable
7  but god will shoot at themsuddenly they will be wounded by an arrow
8  their own tongue will cause their downfallall those looking on will shake their head
9  then all men will become afraidand they will proclaim what god has doneand they will have insight into his deeds
10  the righteous one will rejoice in jehovah and take refuge in himall the upright in heart will exult
81  shout joyfully to god our strength
shout in triumph to the god of jacob
2  begin the music and take a tambourinethe melodious harp together with the stringed instrument
3  blow the horn on the new moonon the full moon for the day of our festival
4  for it is a decree for israela ruling of the god of jacob
5  he established it as a reminder for josephwhen he went out against the land of egypt
i heard a voice that i did not recognize
6  i lifted the burden from his shoulderhis hands were freed from the basket
7  in your distress you called and i rescued youi answered you from the thundercloud
i tested you at the waters of merʹibah
selah
8  hear my people and i will testify against you
o israel if you would only listen to me
9  among you there will be no strange godand you will not bow down to a foreign god
10  i jehovah am your godthe one who brought you out of the land of egypt
open your mouth wide and i will fill it
11  but my people did not listen to my voiceisrael would not submit to me
12  so i let them follow their stubborn heartsthey did what they thought was right
13  if only my people would listen to meif only israel would walk in my ways
14  their enemies i would quickly subduei would turn my hand against their adversaries
15  those who hate jehovah will cringe in his presenceand their outcome will be forever
16  but he will feed you with the finest wheatand satisfy you with honey from the rock
78  listen my people to my lawincline your ear to the words of my mouth
2  i will open my mouth in a proverb
i will propound riddles of long ago
3  the things we have heard and knowwhich our fathers have related to us
4  we will not hide from their sonswe will relate to the generation to comethe praiseworthy deeds of jehovah and his strengththe wonderful things he has done
5  he established a reminder in jacoband set a law in israelhe commanded our forefathersto make these things known to their children
6  so that the next generationthe children yet to be born might know them
they in turn would relate them to their children
7  then these would put their confidence in god
they would not forget gods worksbut would observe his commandments
8  then they would not be like their forefathersa stubborn and rebellious generationa generation whose heart was unsteadyand whose spirit was not faithful to god
9  the eʹphraimites were armed with the bowbut they retreated in the day of battle
10  they did not keep the covenant of godand refused to walk in his law
11  they also forgot what he had donehis wonderful works that he showed them
12  he did marvelous things in the sight of their forefathersin the land of egypt the region of zoʹan
13  he split the sea to let them pass throughand he made the waters stand up like a dam
14  he led them with a cloud by dayand the whole night with the light of a fire
15  he split rocks in the wildernesshe let them drink their fill as if from deep waters
16  he brought streams out of a cragand caused waters to flow down like rivers
17  but they continued to sin against himby rebelling against the most high in the desert
18  they challenged god in their heartby demanding food that they craved
19  so they spoke against godsaying can god spread a table in the wilderness
20  look he struck a rockso that waters flowed and streams flooded out
can he also give us breador can he provide meat for his people
21  when jehovah heard them he became furiousa fire blazed against jacoband his anger flared up against israel
22  because they did not put faith in godthey did not trust in his ability to save them
23  so he commanded the cloudy skies aboveand he opened the doors of heaven
24  he kept raining down manna for them to eathe gave them the grain of heaven
25  men ate the bread of mighty oneshe provided enough to satisfy them
26  he stirred up the east wind in the heavensand made a south wind blow by his power
27  and he rained down meat on them like dustbirds like the sand of the seashore
28  he made them fall in the midst of his campall around his tents
29  and they ate and gorged themselveshe gave them what they desired
30  but before they fully satisfied their cravingwhile their food was yet in their mouth
31  gods wrath flared up against them
he put to death their strongest menhe brought down the young men of israel
32  despite this they sinned even moreand did not put faith in his wonderful works
33  so he brought their days to an end as if a mere breathand their years by sudden terrors
34  but as often as he killed them they would search for himthey would return and look for god
35  remembering that god was their rockand that the most high god was their redeemer
36  but they tried to deceive him with their mouthand lied to him with their tongue
37  their heart was not steadfast toward himand they were not faithful to his covenant
38  but he was mercifulhe would forgive their error and not bring them to ruin
he often held back his angerinstead of stirring up all his wrath
39  for he remembered that they were flesha wind that blows past and does not return
40  how often they rebelled against him in the wildernessand made him feel hurt in the desert
41  again and again they put god to the testand they grieved the holy one of israel
42  they did not remember his powerthe day that he rescued them from the adversary
43  how he displayed his signs in egyptand his miracles in the region of zoʹan
44  and how he turned the nile canals into bloodso that they could not drink from their streams
45  he sent swarms of gadflies to devour themand frogs to bring them to ruin
46  he gave their crops to the voracious locuststhe fruit of their labor to the swarming locusts
47  he destroyed their vines with hailand their sycamore trees with hailstones
48  he gave their beasts of burden over to the hailand their livestock to the lightning bolts
49  he inflicted his burning anger on themfury and indignation and distresscompanies of angels bringing calamity
50  he cleared a pathway for his anger
he did not spare them from deathand he gave them over to pestilence
51  finally he struck down all the firstborn of egyptthe beginning of their procreative power in the tents of ham
52  then he brought his people out like a flockand guided them like a drove in the wilderness
53  he led them in securityand they felt no fearthe sea covered their enemies
54  and he brought them to his holy territorythis mountainous region that his right hand acquired
55  he drove out the nations from before themhe allotted to them an inheritance by the measuring linehe settled the tribes of israel in their homes
56  but they kept challenging god the most high and rebelling against himthey did not pay attention to his reminders
57  they also turned away and were as treacherous as their forefathers
they were as unreliable as a loose bow
58  they kept offending him with their high placesand they incited him to fury with their carved images
59  god heard and became furiousso he utterly rejected israel
60  he finally forsook the tabernacle of shiʹlohthe tent where he had resided among men
61  he let the symbol of his strength go into captivityhis splendor into the hand of the adversary
62  he handed his people over to the swordand became furious with his inheritance
63  fire consumed his young menand to his virgins no wedding songs were sung
64  his priests fell by the swordand their own widows did not weep
65  then jehovah woke up as from sleeplike a mighty man waking up from wine
66  and he drove his adversaries backhe put them to lasting disgrace
67  he rejected the tent of josephhe did not choose the tribe of eʹphraim
68  but he chose the tribe of judahmount zion which he loves
69  he made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavenslike the earth that he has established forever
70  he chose david his servantand took him from the sheep pens
71  from tending the nursing eweshe made him the shepherd over jacob his peopleand over israel his inheritance
72  he shepherded them with integrity of heartand with skillful hands he led them
8  o jehovah our lord how majestic your name is throughout the earthyou have set your splendor even higher than the heavens
2  out of the mouth of children and infants you have established strengthon account of your adversariesto silence the enemy and the avenger
3  when i see your heavens the works of your fingersthe moon and the stars that you have prepared

6  you gave him dominion over the works of your handsyou have put everything under his feet
7  all the flocks and cattleas well as the wild animals
8  the birds of the heavens and the fish of the seawhatever passes through the paths of the seas
9  o jehovah our lord how majestic your name is throughout the earth
72  o god give your judgments to the kingand endow the son of the king with your righteousness
2  may he plead the cause of your people with righteousnessand of your lowly ones with justice
3  may the mountains bring peace to the peopleand may the hills bring righteousness
4  let him defend the lowly among the peoplelet him save the sons of the poorand let him crush the defrauder
5  they will fear you as long as there is a sunand as long as the moon remainsfor generation after generation
6  he will be like the rain that falls on the mown grasslike showers of rain that water the earth
7  in his days the righteous will flourishand peace will abound until the moon is no more
8  he will have subjects from sea to seaand from the river to the ends of the earth
9  the desert dwellers will bow down before himand his enemies will lick the dust
10  the kings of tarʹshish and of the islands will pay tribute
the kings of sheʹba and of seʹba will present gifts
11  all the kings will bow down before himand all the nations will serve him
12  for he will rescue the poor who cry for helpalso the lowly one and whoever has no helper
13  he will have pity on the lowly and the poorand the lives of the poor he will save
14  from oppression and from violence he will rescue themand their blood will be precious in his eyes
15  may he live and be given the gold of sheʹba
may prayers be said for him continuallyand may he be blessed all day long

20  this completes the prayers of david the son of jesʹse
69  save me o god for the waters threaten my life
2  i have sunk down into the deep mud where there is no solid ground
i have come into deep watersand the rushing stream has swept me away
3  i am exhausted from calling outmy throat has become hoarse
my eyes have grown weary while waiting for my god
4  those hating me without causeare more numerous than the hairs of my head
those who would do away with memy treacherous enemies have become many
i was forced to hand over what i had not stolen
5  o god you are aware of my foolishnessand my guilt is not hidden from you
6  may those hoping in you not be put to shame because of meo sovereign lord jehovah of armies
may those seeking you not be humiliated because of meo god of israel
7  i suffer reproach on your accounthumiliation covers my face
8  i have become a stranger to my brothersa foreigner to the sons of my mother
9  zeal for your house has consumed meand the reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me
10  when i humbled myself with fastingi was reproached for it
11  when i made sackcloth my clothingi became an object of scorn to them
12  i am the talk of those sitting in the city gateand the drunkards make me the subject of their songs
13  but may my prayer come to youo jehovah at an acceptable time
in your abundant loyal love o godanswer me with your sure acts of salvation
14  rescue me from the miredo not let me sink down
rescue me from those who hate meand from the deep waters
15  do not let the rushing floodwaters sweep me awayor let the deep swallow meor let the well close its mouth over me
16  answer me o jehovah for your loyal love is good
according to your abundant mercy turn toward me
17  and do not hide your face from your servant
answer me quickly for i am in distress
18  come near to me and rescue meredeem me on account of my enemies
19  you know my reproach and my disgrace and my humiliation
you see all my foes
20  reproach has broken my heart and the wound is incurable
i was hoping for sympathy but there was noneand for comforters but i found none
21  but for food they gave me poisonand for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink
22  let their table become a trap for themand their prosperity a snare
23  let their eyes become darkened so that they cannot seeand make their hips tremble constantly
24  pour out upon them your indignationand may your burning anger overtake them
25  let their encampment become desolatelet there be no inhabitant in their tents
26  for they pursue the one whom you struckand they keep recounting the pains of those you wounded
27  add more guilt to their guiltand may they have no share in your righteousness
28  let them be erased from the book of the livingand may they not be enrolled among the righteous
29  but i am afflicted and in pain
may your saving power o god protect me
30  i will sing praises to the name of godand i will magnify him with thanksgiving
31  this will please jehovah more than a bullmore than a young bull with horns and hooves
32  the meek will see it and rejoice
you who are seeking god may your hearts revive
33  for jehovah is listening to the poorand he will not despise his captive people
34  let heaven and earth praise himthe seas and everything that moves in them
35  for god will save zionand will rebuild the cities of judahand they will dwell there and possess it

you kept me alive you spared me from sinking into the pit
4  sing praises to jehovah you his loyal onesgive thanks to his holy name
5  because being under his anger is only for a momentbut being in his favor is for a lifetime
weeping may come in the evening but in the morning there is a joyful cry
6  when i was untroubled i said i will never be shaken
7  o jehovah while i was in your favor you made me as strong as a mountain
but when you hid your face i became terrified
8  to you o jehovah i kept callingand to jehovah i kept pleading for favor
9  what profit is there in my death in my going down to the pit will the dust praise you will it tell of your faithfulness
10  hear o jehovah and show me favor

may those who are plotting to destroy me retreat in disgrace
5  may they become like chaff in the windmay jehovahs angel drive them away

11  malicious witnesses come forwardasking me things i know nothing about
12  they repay me with bad for goodmaking me feel bereaved
13  but when they were ill i clothed myself with sackclothi afflicted myself by fastingand when my prayer would return unanswered
14  i walked about mourning as for a friend or a brother of minei bowed down in sorrow like one mourning for his mother
15  but when i stumbled they rejoiced and gathered togetherthey gathered together to strike me down in ambushthey tore me to pieces and did not keep silent
16  the ungodly scornfully mock methey grind their teeth against me
17  o jehovah how long will you just look on rescue me from their attacksmy precious life from the young lions
18  then i will give thanks to you in the great congregationi will praise you among the throngs of people
19  do not let those who for no reason are my enemies gloat over medo not let those hating me without cause wink their eyes maliciously
20  for they do not speak words of peacebut they deceptively scheme against the peaceful ones of the land
21  they open their mouth wide to accuse mesaying aha aha our eyes have seen it
22  you have seen this o jehovah
do not remain silent

26  let all of them be put to shame and disgracedthose who gloat over my calamity
let those who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and humiliation
27  but let those who take pleasure in my righteousness shout joyfullymay they constantly say may jehovah be magnified who takes pleasure in the peace of his servant
28  then my tongue will recount your righteousnessand praise you all day long
18  i have affection for you o jehovah my strength
2  jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the one who rescues me
my god is my rock in whom i take refugemy shield and my horn of salvation my secure refuge
3  i call on jehovah who is worthy of praiseand i will be saved from my enemies
4  the ropes of death encircled meflash floods of worthless men terrified me
5  the ropes of the grave surrounded methe snares of death confronted me
6  in my distress i called on jehovahto my god i kept crying for help
from his temple he heard my voiceand my cry to him for help reached his ears
7  then the earth began to shake and rockthe foundations of the mountains trembledand shook back and forth because he had been angered
8  smoke ascended from his nostrilsand a consuming fire came from his mouthglowing coals blazed from him
9  he made the heavens bend as he descendedand thick gloom was beneath his feet
10  he rode on a cherub and came flying
he swooped down on the wings of a spirit
11  he then covered himself in darknessall around him as a shelterdark waters and thick clouds
12  from the brightness before himhail and fiery coals broke through the clouds
13  then jehovah began to thunder in the heavensthe most high made his voice heardwith hailstones and fiery coals
14  he shot his arrows and scattered themhe hurled his lightning and threw them into confusion
15  the streambeds became visiblethe foundations of the land were exposed by your rebuke o jehovahby the blast of the breath from your nostrils
16  he reached down from on highhe took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters
17  he rescued me from my strong enemyfrom those hating me who were stronger than i was
18  they confronted me on the day of my disasterbut jehovah was my support
19  he brought me out into a place of safetyhe rescued me because he was pleased with me
20  jehovah rewards me according to my righteousnesshe repays me according to the innocence of my hands
21  for i have kept the ways of jehovahand i have not wickedly abandoned my god
22  all his judgments are before mei will not disregard his statutes
23  i will remain blameless before himand i will keep myself from error
24  may jehovah repay me according to my righteousnessaccording to the innocence of my hands before him
25  with someone loyal you act in loyaltywith the blameless man you deal blamelessly
26  with the pure you show yourself purebut with the crooked you show yourself shrewd
27  for you save those who are lowlybut you abase the haughty
28  for it is you who light my lamp o jehovahmy god who lights up my darkness
29  with your help i can charge against a marauder bandby gods power i can scale a wall
30  the way of the true god is perfectthe saying of jehovah is refined
he is a shield to all those taking refuge in him
31  for who is a god besides jehovah and who is a rock except our god
32  the true god is the one who clothes me with strengthand he will make my way perfect
33  he makes my feet like those of a deerhe makes me stand on high places
34  he trains my hands for warfaremy arms can bend a bow of copper
35  you give me your shield of salvationyour right hand supports meand your humility makes me great
36  you widen the path for my footstepsmy feet will not slip
37  i will pursue my enemies and overtake themi will not return until they are wiped out
38  i will crush them so that they cannot rise upthey will fall under my feet
39  you will equip me with strength for the battleyou will make my foes collapse under me
40  you will make my enemies retreat from meand i will put an end to those who hate me
41  they cry for help but there is no one to save themthey even cry to jehovah but he does not answer them
42  i will pound them as fine as dust in the windi will throw them out like mud in the streets
43  you will rescue me from the faultfinding of the people
you will appoint me the head of nations
a people whom i have not known will serve me
44  at a mere report they will obey meforeigners will come cringing before me
45  foreigners will lose couragethey will come trembling from their strongholds
46  jehovah is alive praised be my rock let the god of my salvation be exalted
47  the true god executes vengeance for mehe subdues the peoples under me
48  he rescues me from my angry enemiesyou lift me high above those who attack meyou save me from the man of violence
49  that is why i will glorify you among the nations o jehovahand to your name i will sing praises
50  he performs great acts of salvation for his kinghe displays loyal love to his anointed oneto david and his offspring forever
115  not to us o jehovah not to usbut to your name give glorybecause of your loyal love and your faithfulness
2  why should the nations say where is their god
3  our god is in the heavenshe does whatever he pleases
4  their idols are silver and goldthe work of human hands
5  a mouth they have but they cannot speakeyes but they cannot see
6  ears they have but they cannot heara nose but they cannot smell
7  hands they have but they cannot feelfeet but they cannot walkthey make no sound with their throat
8  the people who make them will become just like themas will all those who trust in them
9  o israel trust in jehovahhe is their help and their shield
10  o house of aaron trust in jehovahhe is their help and their shield
11  you who fear jehovah trust in jehovahhe is their help and their shield

13  he will bless those who fear jehovahthe small as well as the great
14  jehovah will give you an increaseto you and your children
15  may you be blessed by jehovahthe maker of heaven and earth
16  as for the heavens they belong to jehovahbut the earth he has given to the sons of men
17  the dead do not praise jahnor do any who go down into the silence of death
18  but we will praise jahfrom now on and forever

2  may you make a just decision in my behalfmay your eyes see what is right
3  you have examined my heart you have inspected me by nightyou have refined meyou will find that i have not schemed anything badand my mouth has not transgressed
4  as for the activities of menin accord with the word of your lips i avoid the paths of the robber
5  let my steps stay on your tracksso that my feet will not stumble

9  guard me from the wicked who attack mefrom my mortal enemies who surround me
10  they have become insensitivewith their mouth they speak arrogantly
11  now they hem us inthey watch for the chance to cause our downfall
12  he is like a lion eager to tear its prey to pieceslike a young lion crouching in ambush
13  rise up o jehovah to confront him and bring him downrescue me from the wicked with your sword
14  rescue me with your hand o jehovahfrom men of this world whose share is in this lifethose whom you fill with the good things you provideand who leave an inheritance to their many sons
15  but as for me in righteousness i will see your facei am satisfied to awaken in your presence
106  praise jah give thanks to jehovah for he is goodhis loyal love endures forever
2  who can fully declare jehovahs mighty actsor proclaim all his praiseworthy deeds
3  happy are those who act with justicewho always do what is right
4  remember me o jehovah when you show favor toward your people
take care of me with your acts of salvation
5  so that i may enjoy the goodness you show your chosen onesthat i may rejoice along with your nationthat i may proudly praise you along with your inheritance
6  we have sinned just as our forefathers didwe have done wrong we have acted wickedly
7  our forefathers in egypt did not appreciate your wonderful works
they did not remember your abundant loyal lovebut they rebelled at the sea by the red sea
8  but he saved them for the sake of his nameto make his mightiness known
9  he rebuked the red sea and it dried uphe led them through its depths as through a desert
10  he saved them from the hand of their foeand reclaimed them from the hand of the enemy
11  the waters covered their adversariesnot one of them survived
12  then they had faith in his promisethey began to sing his praise
13  but they quickly forgot what he didthey did not wait for his counsel
14  they gave way to their selfish desires in the wildernessthey tested god in the desert
15  he gave them what they requestedbut then struck them with disease that made them waste away
16  in the camp they grew jealous of mosesand of aaron the holy one of jehovah
17  the earth then opened up and swallowed daʹthanand covered those assembled with abiʹram
18  a fire blazed among their groupa flame consumed the wicked
19  they made a calf in hoʹreband bowed down to a statue of metal
20  they exchanged my gloryfor the representation of a grasseating bull
21  they forgot god their saviorwho did great things in egypt
22  wonderful works in the land of hamaweinspiring deeds at the red sea
23  he was about to order their annihilationbut moses his chosen one interceded with himto avert his destructive anger
24  then they despised the desirable landthey had no faith in his promise
25  they kept grumbling in their tentsthey did not listen to the voice of jehovah
26  so he raised his hand in an oath concerning themthat he would make them fall in the wilderness
27  he would make their descendants fall among the nationsand he would scatter them throughout the lands
28  then they joined in worship of baʹal of peʹorand they ate sacrifices offered to the dead
29  they provoked him by their actionsand a scourge broke out among them
30  but when phinʹehas stood up and intervenedthe scourge was halted
31  and it was counted to him as righteousnessthrough all generations forever
32  they provoked him at the waters of merʹibahand it went badly for moses because of them
33  they embittered his spiritand he spoke rashly with his lips
34  they did not annihilate the peoplesas jehovah had commanded them
35  but they mingled with the nationsand adopted their ways
36  they kept serving their idolsand these became a snare to them
37  they would sacrifice their sonsand their daughters to demons
38  they kept spilling innocent bloodthe blood of their own sons and daughterswhom they sacrificed to the idols of caʹnaanand the land was polluted with bloodshed
39  they became unclean by their worksthey committed spiritual prostitution by their deeds
40  so the anger of jehovah blazed against his peopleand he grew to detest his inheritance
41  he repeatedly handed them over to the nationsso that those who hated them might rule over them
42  their enemies oppressed themand they were subject to their power
43  many times he rescued thembut they would rebel and disobeyand they would be brought low for their error
44  but he would see their distressand hear their cry for help
45  for their sake he would remember his covenantand he would feel pity moved by his great loyal love
46  he would cause them to be pitiedby all who held them captive
47  save us o jehovah our godand gather us from the nationsso that we may give thanks to your holy nameand exult in praising you
48  may jehovah the god of israel be praisedthroughout all eternity
and let all the people say amen praise jah
50  the god of gods jehovah has spokenhe summons the earthfrom the rising of the sun until its setting
2  out of zion the perfection of beauty god shines forth
3  our god will come and cannot remain silent
before him is a consuming fireand a great storm rages all around him
4  he summons the heavens above and the earthso as to judge his people
5  gather to me my loyal onesthose making a covenant with me over sacrifice
6  the heavens proclaim his righteousnessfor god himself is judge
selah
7  listen o my people and i will speakisrael i will bear witness against you
i am god your god
8  i do not reprove you because of your sacrificesnor because of your whole burnt offerings that are constantly before me
9  i do not need to take a bull from your housenor goats from your pens
10  for every wild animal of the forest is mineeven the beasts upon a thousand mountains
11  i know every bird of the mountainsthe countless animals of the field are mine
12  if i were hungry i would not tell youfor the productive land and everything in it is mine
13  will i eat the flesh of bullsand drink the blood of goats
14  offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to godand pay your vows to the most high
15  call on me in the time of distress
i will rescue you and you will glorify me
16  but god will say to the wicked what right do you have to relate my regulationsor to speak about my covenant
17  for you hate disciplineand you keep turning your back on my words
18  when you see a thief you approve of himand you keep company with adulterers
19  you use your mouth to spread what is badand deception is attached to your tongue
20  you sit and speak against your own brotheryou reveal the faults of your own mothers son
21  when you did these things i remained silentso you thought that i would be just like you
but now i will reprove youand i will state my case against you
22  please consider this you who forget godso that i may not tear you to pieces with no one to rescue you
23  the one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies meand as for the one who follows a set coursei will cause him to see salvation by god
129  since my youth they have constantly attacked me let israel now say
2  since my youth they have constantly attacked mebut they have not defeated me
3  plowmen have plowed across my backthey have made their furrows long
4  but jehovah is righteoushe has cut up the ropes of the wicked
5  they will be put to shame and will retreat in disgraceall those who hate zion
6  they will become like grass on the rooftopsthat withers before it is pulled up
7  that cannot fill the reapers handnor the arms of the one gathering sheaves
8  those passing by will not say may the blessing of jehovah be upon youwe bless you in the name of jehovah
109  o god whom i praise do not remain silent
2  for the wicked and the deceitful open their mouths against me
they speak about me with lying tongues
3  they surround me with hateful wordsand they attack me without cause
4  they resist me in response to my lovebut i continue to pray
5  they repay me with bad for goodand hatred for my love
6  appoint a wicked man over himmay a resister stand at his right hand
7  when he is judged may he be found guiltymay even his prayer be counted as a sin
8  let his days be fewhis office of oversight let someone else take
9  let his children become fatherlessand his wife a widow
10  may his children become wandering beggarsforaging for food from their ruined homes
11  may his creditor seize all that he hasand may strangers plunder his possessions
12  may no one extend kindness to himand may no one show favor to his fatherless children
13  let his descendants be cut offmay their name be erased within a generation
14  let the error of his forefathers be remembered by jehovahand may the sin of his mother not be erased
15  may jehovah always be mindful of what they have doneand may he cut off the memory of them from the earth
16  for he did not remember to show kindnessbut he kept pursuing the oppressed poor and brokenhearted manto put him to death
17  he loved to pronounce a curse so that is what came upon himhe had no desire to bless so he received no blessing
18  he was clothed with curses as his garment
and they were poured into his body like waterinto his bones like oil
19  may his curses be like the clothing in which he wraps himselfand like a belt he always wears
20  this is the payment from jehovah for the one who resists meand for those who speak evil things against me
21  but you jehovah the sovereign lordact in my behalf for the sake of your name
rescue me because your loyal love is good
22  for i am helpless and poorand my heart has been pierced within me
23  i am passing away like a fading shadowi have been shaken off like a locust
24  my knees give way from fastingmy body is thin and i am wasting away
25  i have become the object of their taunts
when they see me they shake their heads
26  help me o jehovah my godsave me by your loyal love
27  may they know that this is by your handthat you o jehovah have done it
28  let them pronounce a curse but may you give a blessing
when they rise up against me may they be put to shamebut let your servant rejoice
29  let those who resist me be clothed with humiliationmay they be wrapped in their shame as in a robe
30  my mouth will fervently praise jehovahi will praise him in front of many people
31  for he will stand at the right hand of the poorto save him from those who condemn him
143  o jehovah hear my prayerlisten to my plea for help
in your faithfulness and in your righteousness answer me
2  do not enter into judgment with your servantfor no one living can be righteous before you
3  for the enemy pursues mehe has crushed my life into the ground
he has caused me to dwell in darkness like those long dead
4  my spirit is failingmy heart is numb within me
5  i remember the days of oldi meditate on all your activityi eagerly ponder over the work of your hands
6  i spread out my hands to youi am like a parched land that thirsts for you

7  look i would flee far away
i would lodge in the wilderness
selah
8  i would hurry to a place of shelteraway from the raging wind away from the storm

10  day and night they walk around on its wallswithin it are malice and trouble
11  ruin is in its midstoppression and deception never depart from its public square
12  for it is not an enemy who taunts meotherwise i could put up with it
it is not a foe who has risen up against meotherwise i could conceal myself from him
13  but it is you a man like memy own companion whom i know well
14  we used to enjoy a warm friendship togetherinto the house of god we used to walk along with the multitude
15  may destruction overtake them let them go down alive into the gravefor evil resides among them and within them
16  as for me i will call out to godand jehovah will save me
17  evening and morning and noontime i am troubled and i groanand he hears my voice
18  he will rescue me and give me peace from those fighting against mefor multitudes come against me
19  god will hear and respond to themthe one who sits enthroned from of old
selah they will refuse to changethose who have not feared god
20  he attacked those at peace with himhe violated his covenant
21  his words are smoother than butterbut conflict is in his heart
his words are softer than oilbut they are drawn swords
22  throw your burden on jehovahand he will sustain you

23  but you o god will bring them down to the deepest pit
those bloodguilty and deceitful men will not live out half their days
but as for me i will trust in you

73  god is truly good to israel to those pure in heart
2  as for me my feet had almost strayedmy steps had nearly slipped
3  for i became envious of the arrogantwhen i would see the peace of the wicked
4  for they have no pain in their deaththeir bodies are healthy
5  they are not troubled like other humansnor do they suffer like other men
6  therefore haughtiness is their necklaceviolence clothes them as a garment
7  their prosperity makes their eyes bulgethey have exceeded the imaginations of the heart
8  they scoff and say evil things
they arrogantly threaten oppression
9  they speak as if they were as high as heavenand their tongues swagger about in the earth
10  so his people turn aside to themand they drink from their abundant water
11  they say how does god know does the most high really have knowledge
12  yes these are the wicked who always have it easy
they keep increasing their wealth
13  surely in vain i have kept my heart pureand washed my hands in innocence
14  and i was troubled all day longevery morning i was chastised
15  but if i had said these thingsi would have betrayed your people
16  when i tried to understand itit was troubling to me
17  until i entered the grand sanctuary of godand i discerned their future
18  surely you place them on slippery ground
you make them fall to their ruin
19  how suddenly they are devastated how sudden is their finish as they come to a terrible end
20  like a dream when one wakes up o jehovahwhen you rouse yourself you will dismiss their image
21  but my heart was sourand deep inside i felt sharp pain
22  i was unreasoning and lacked understandingi was like a senseless beast before you
23  but now i am continually with youyou have taken hold of my right hand
24  you guide me with your adviceand afterward you will lead me to glory
25  whom do i have in the heavens and besides you i desire nothing on earth
26  my body and my heart may failbut god is the rock of my heart and my portion forever
27  truly those keeping far from you will perish
you will put an end to everyone who immorally leaves you

10  for 40 years i felt a loathing toward that generation and i said they are a people who always go astray in their heartsthey have not come to know my ways
11  so i swore in my anger they will not enter into my rest
139  o jehovah you have searched through me and you know me
2  you know when i sit down and when i rise up
you discern my thoughts from afar
3  you observe me when i travel and when i lie downyou are familiar with all my ways
4  there is not a word on my tonguebut look o jehovah you already know it well
5  behind and before me you surround meand you lay your hand upon me
6  such knowledge is beyond my comprehension
it is too high for me to reach
7  where can i escape from your spiritand where can i run away from your face
8  if i were to ascend to heaven you would be thereand if i were to make my bed in the grave look you would be there
9  if i would fly away with the wings of the dawnto reside by the most remote sea
10  even there your hand would lead meand your right hand would take hold of me

3  whom he gathered together from the landsfrom the east and from the westfrom the north and from the south
4  they wandered about in the wilderness in the desertthey did not find a way to a city where they could live
5  they were hungry and thirstythey were faint from exhaustion
6  they kept crying out to jehovah in their distresshe rescued them from their plight
7  he had them walk in the right wayto come to a city where they could live
8  let people give thanks to jehovah for his loyal loveand for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men
9  for he has satisfied the thirstyand filled the hungry with good things
10  some were living in deepest darknessprisoners in affliction and in irons
11  for they had rebelled against the word of godthey disrespected the counsel of the most high
12  so he humbled their hearts through hardshipthey stumbled and there was no one to help them
13  they called to jehovah for help in their distresshe saved them from their plight
14  he brought them out of deepest darknessand he tore off their shackles
15  let people give thanks to jehovah for his loyal loveand for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men
16  for he has broken down the doors of copperand cut through the bars of iron
17  they were foolish and suffered afflictionon account of their transgressions and their errors
18  they lost their appetite for all foodthey drew near the gates of death
19  they would call to jehovah for help in their distresshe would save them from their plight
20  he would send his word and heal themand rescue them from the pits they were trapped in
21  let people give thanks to jehovah for his loyal loveand for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men
22  let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgivingand declare his works with a joyful cry
23  those who travel on the sea in shipswho ply their trade over the vast waters
24  they have seen the works of jehovahand his wonderful works in the deep
25  how by his word a windstorm ariseslifting up the waves of the sea
26  they rise up to the skythey plunge down to the depths
their courage melts away because of the impending calamity
27  they reel and stagger like a drunken manand all their skill proves useless
28  then they cry out to jehovah in their distressand he rescues them from their plight
29  he calms the windstormthe waves of the sea grow quiet
30  they rejoice when these grow stilland he leads them to their desired harbor
31  let people give thanks to jehovah for his loyal loveand for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men
32  let them exalt him in the congregation of the peopleand let them praise him in the council of the elders
33  he turns rivers into a desertand springs of water into parched ground
34  fruitful land into salty wastelandbecause of the wickedness of those dwelling in it
35  he turns the desert into reedy pools of waterand dry land into springs of water
36  he causes the hungry to dwell thereso that they may establish a city where they can live
37  they sow fields and plant vineyardsthat yield fruitful crops
38  he blesses them and they increase greatlyhe does not let their cattle diminish
39  but again they become few and are humiliatedbecause of oppression calamity and grief
40  he pours out contempt upon noblesand makes them wander in trackless wastelands
41  but he protects the poor from oppressionand makes their families as numerous as a flock
42  the upright see this and rejoicebut all the unrighteous shut their mouths
43  whoever is wise will observe these thingsand will carefully consider jehovahs acts of loyal love
74  why o god have you rejected us forever why does your anger burn against the flock of your pasture
2  remember the people you acquired long agothe tribe you redeemed as your inheritance
remember mount zion where you have resided
3  direct your steps to the perpetual ruins
the enemy has devastated everything in the holy place
4  your foes roared inside your meeting place
they have set up their own banners as signs there
5  they were like men wielding axes against a thick forest
6  they broke up all its engravings with axes and iron bars
7  they set your sanctuary on fire
they profaned the tabernacle bearing your name casting it to the ground
8  they and their offspring have said in their hearts all the meeting places of god in the land must be burned
9  there are no signs for us to seethere is no longer any prophetand no one among us knows how long this will last
10  how long o god will the adversary keep taunting will the enemy treat your name with disrespect forever
11  why do you hold back your hand your right hand draw it out of your bosom and put an end to them
12  but god is my king from long agothe one performing acts of salvation on the earth
13  you stirred up the sea with your strengthyou smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters
14  you crushed the heads of leviʹathanyou gave it as food to the people to those inhabiting the deserts
15  you cut openings for the springs and the streamsyou dried up everflowing rivers
16  the day belongs to you also the night
you made the light and the sun
17  you set up all the boundaries of the earthyou made summer and winter
18  remember the enemys taunts o jehovahhow a foolish people treats your name with disrespect
19  do not surrender the life of your turtledove to the wild beasts
do not forget the life of your afflicted people forever
20  remember the covenantfor the dark places of the earth have become full of the haunts of violence
21  may the crushed one not turn away disappointedmay the lowly and the poor praise your name
22  rise up o god and plead your legal case
remember how the foolish taunt you all day long
23  do not forget what your foes are saying
