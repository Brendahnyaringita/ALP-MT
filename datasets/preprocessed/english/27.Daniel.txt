10  in the third year of king cyrus of persia a revelation was given to daniel who was called by the name belteshazʹzar and the message was true and it was about a great conflict
and he understood the message and was given understanding about what he had seen
2  in those days i daniel had been mourning for three full weeks
3  i ate no rich food and no meat or wine entered my mouth and i did not put any oil on myself for three full weeks
4  on the 24th day of the first month while i was on the bank of the great river the tiʹgris
5  i looked up and saw a man clothed in linen and around his waist was a belt of gold from uʹphaz
6  his body was like chrysʹolite his face had the appearance of lightning his eyes were like fiery torches his arms and his feet looked like burnished copper and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude
7  only i daniel saw the vision the men with me did not see the vision
however a great trembling seized them and they ran away and hid
8  then i was left by myself and when i saw this great vision there was no power left in me and my dignified appearance left me and i lost all strength
9  then i heard the sound of him speaking but when i heard him speaking i fell fast asleep with my face to the ground
10  but then a hand touched me and it stirred me to get up on my hands and knees
11  then he said to me o daniel you very precious man give attention to the words that i am about to speak to you
now stand up in your place for i have been sent to you
when he said this to me i stood up trembling
12  he then said to me do not be afraid o daniel
your words have been heard from the first day that you gave your heart to understanding and to humbling yourself before your god and i have come because of your words
13  but the prince of the royal realm of persia stood in opposition to me for 21 days
but then miʹchael one of the foremost princes came to help me and i remained there beside the kings of persia
14  i have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the final part of the days because it is a vision yet for the days to come
15  now when he spoke these words to me i turned my face to the ground and became speechless
16  then one who looked like a man touched my lips and i opened my mouth and said to the one who stood in front of me my lord i am shuddering because of the vision and i have no strength
17  so how can my lords servant speak with my lord for now i have no strength and there is no breath left in me
18  the one who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me
19  then he said do not be afraid o very precious man
may you have peace
be strong yes be strong
as he spoke with me i was strengthened and i said let my lord speak for you have strengthened me
20  then he said do you know why i have come to you now i will go back to fight with the prince of persia
when i leave the prince of greece will come
21  however i will tell you the things recorded in the writings of truth
there is no one strongly supporting me in these things but miʹchael your prince
4  from king nebuchadnezʹzar to all the peoples nations and language groups dwelling in all the earth may your peace abound
2  i am pleased to declare the signs and wonders that the most high god has performed toward me
3  how great are his signs and how mighty his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his rulership is for generation after generation
4  i nebuchadnezʹzar was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace
5  i saw a dream that made me afraid
as i lay on my bed the images and visions of my head frightened me
6  so i issued an order to bring in before me all the wise men of babylon so that they could make known to me the interpretation of the dream
7  at that time the magicpracticing priests the conjurers the chaldeʹans and the astrologers came in
when i told them what the dream was they could not make its interpretation known to me
8  at last there came in before me daniel whose name is belteshazʹzar after the name of my god and in whom there is the spirit of the holy gods and i told him the dream
9  o belteshazʹzar the chief of the magicpracticing priests i well know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no secret is too difficult for you
so explain to me the visions i saw in my dream and its interpretation
10  in the visions of my head while on my bed i saw a tree in the midst of the earth and its height was enormous
11  the tree grew and became strong and its top reached the heavens and it was visible to the ends of the whole earth
12  its foliage was beautiful and its fruit was abundant and there was food on it for all
beneath it the beasts of the field would seek shade and on its branches the birds of the heavens would dwell and all creatures would feed from it
13  as i viewed the visions of my head while on my bed i saw a watcher a holy one coming down from the heavens
14  he called out loudly chop down the tree cut off its branches shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit let the beasts flee from beneath it and the birds from its branches
15  but leave the stump with its roots in the ground with a banding of iron and of copper among the grass of the field
let it be wet with the dew of the heavens and let its portion be with the beasts among the vegetation of the earth
16  let its heart be changed from that of a human and let it be given the heart of a beast and let seven times pass over it
17  this is by the decree of watchers and the request is by the word of the holy ones so that people living may know that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he gives it to whomever he wants and he sets up over it even the lowliest of men
18  this was the dream that i king nebuchadnezʹzar saw now you o belteshazʹzar tell its interpretation for all the other wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the interpretation known to me
but you are able to do so because the spirit of holy gods is in you
19  at that time daniel whose name is belteshazʹzar was alarmed for a moment and his thoughts began to frighten him
the king said o belteshazʹzar do not let the dream and the interpretation frighten you
belteshazʹzar answered o my lord may the dream apply to those hating you and its interpretation to your enemies
20  the tree that you saw that grew great and became strong whose top reached the heavens and was visible to all the earth
21  which had beautiful foliage abundant fruit and food for all beneath which the beasts of the field would dwell and on whose branches the birds of the heavens would reside
22  it is you o king because you have grown great and become strong and your grandeur has grown and reached to the heavens and your rulership to the ends of the earth
23  and the king saw a watcher a holy one coming down from the heavens who was saying chop down the tree and destroy it but leave the stump with its roots in the ground with a banding of iron and of copper among the grass of the field
and let the dew of the heavens make it wet and let its portion be with the beasts of the field until seven times pass over it
24  this is the interpretation o king it is the decree of the most high that must befall my lord the king
25  you will be driven away from among men and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field and you will be given vegetation to eat just like bulls and you will become wet with the dew of the heavens and seven times will pass over you until you know that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he grants it to whomever he wants
26  but because they said to leave the stump of the tree with its roots your kingdom will be yours again after you come to know that the heavens are ruling
27  therefore o king may my counsel be acceptable to you
turn away from your sins by doing what is right and from your iniquity by showing mercy to the poor
it may be that your prosperity will be extended
28  all of this befell king nebuchadnezʹzar
29  twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of babylon
30  the king was saying is this not babylon the great that i myself have built for the royal house by my own strength and might and for the glory of my majesty
31  while the word was yet in the kings mouth a voice came down from the heavens to you it is being said o king nebuchadnezʹzar the kingdom has gone away from you
32  and from mankind you are being driven away
with the beasts of the field your dwelling will be and you will be given vegetation to eat just like bulls and seven times will pass over you until you know that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he grants it to whomever he wants
33  at that moment the word was fulfilled on nebuchadnezʹzar
he was driven away from mankind and he began to eat vegetation just like bulls and his body became wet with the dew of the heavens until his hair grew long just like eagles feathers and his nails were like birds claws
34  at the end of that time i nebuchadnezʹzar looked up to the heavens and my understanding returned to me and i praised the most high and to the one living forever i gave praise and glory because his rulership is an everlasting rulership and his kingdom is for generation after generation
35  all the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing and he does according to his own will among the army of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth
and there is no one who can hinder him or say to him what have you done
36  at that time my understanding returned to me and the glory of my kingdom my majesty and my splendor returned to me
my high officials and nobles eagerly sought me out and i was restored to my kingdom and even more greatness was added to me
37  now i nebuchadnezʹzar am praising and exalting and glorifying the king of the heavens because all his works are truth and his ways are just and because he is able to humiliate those who are walking in pride
11  as for me in the first year of dariʹus the mede i stood up to strengthen and fortify him
2  what i will tell you now is the truth look three more kings will stand up for persia and the fourth one will amass greater riches than all others
and when he becomes strong by means of his riches he will rouse up everything against the kingdom of greece
3  and a mighty king will stand up and rule with extensive dominion and do as he pleases
4  but when he has stood up his kingdom will be broken and be divided toward the four winds of the heavens but not to his descendants and not like the dominion with which he ruled for his kingdom will be uprooted and go to others besides these
5  and the king of the south will become strong that is one of his princes but one will prevail against him and will rule with extensive dominion greater than that ones ruling power
6  after some years they will make an alliance and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north in order to make an equitable arrangement
but she will not retain the power of her arm and he will not stand nor his arm and she will be given up she and those bringing her in and the one who caused her birth and the one making her strong in those times
7  and one from the sprout of her roots will stand up in his position and he will come to the army and come against the fortress of the king of the north and will take action against them and prevail
8  also with their gods with their metal images with their desirable articles of silver and of gold and with captives he will come to egypt
for some years he will stand off from the king of the north
9  who will come against the kingdom of the king of the south but will go back to his own land
10  as for his sons they will prepare for war and assemble a vast great army
he will certainly advance and sweep through like a flood
but he will go back and he will wage war all the way to his fortress
11  and the king of the south will become bitter and will go out and fight with him that is with the king of the north and he will muster a large crowd but the crowd will be given into that ones hand
12  and the crowd will be carried away
his heart will become exalted and he will cause tens of thousands to fall but he will not make use of his strong position
13  and the king of the north will return and muster a crowd larger than the first and at the end of the times after some years he will surely come with a large army and with many resources
14  in those times many will stand up against the king of the south
and the violent ones among your people will be carried along to try making a vision come true but they will stumble
15  and the king of the north will come and throw up a siege rampart and capture a fortified city
and the arms of the south will not stand nor will his select men and they will have no power to stand
16  the one coming against him will do as he pleases and no one will stand before him
he will stand in the land of the decoration and ability to exterminate will be in his hand
17  he will set his face to come with the full force of his kingdom and there will be equitable terms with him and he will act effectively
as regards the daughter of women it will be granted to him to bring her to ruin
and she will not stand and she will not continue to be his
18  he will turn his face back to the coastlands and will capture many
and a commander will make the reproach from him cease for himself so that his reproach will not be
he will make it turn back on that one
19  then he will turn his face back to the fortresses of his own land and he will stumble and fall and he will not be found
20  and there will stand up in his position one who causes an exactor to pass through the splendid kingdom but in a few days he will be broken though not in anger nor in warfare
21  and there will stand up in his position a despised one and they will not give him the majesty of the kingdom and he will come in during a time of security and take hold of the kingdom by means of smoothness
22  and the arms of the flood will be swept away on account of him and they will be broken as will be the leader of the covenant
23  and because of their alliance with him he will carry on deception and rise up and become mighty by means of a little nation
24  during a time of security he will come into the richest parts of the province and do what his fathers and their fathers have not done
plunder and spoil and goods he will distribute among them and against fortified places he will plot his schemes but only for a time
25  and he will muster his power and his heart against the king of the south with a large army and the king of the south will prepare himself for the war with an exceedingly large and mighty army
and he will not stand because they will plot schemes against him
26  and those eating his delicacies will bring his downfall
as for his army it will be swept away and many will fall down slain
27  as regards these two kings their heart will be inclined to do what is bad and they will sit at one table speaking lies to each other
but nothing will succeed because the end is yet for the time appointed
28  and he will go back to his land with a great amount of goods and his heart will be against the holy covenant
he will act effectively and go back to his land
29  at the time appointed he will return and come against the south
but this time will not be as it was before
30  for the ships of kitʹtim will come against him and he will be humbled
he will go back and hurl denunciations against the holy covenant and act effectively and he will go back and will give attention to those leaving the holy covenant
31  and arms will stand up proceeding from him and they will profane the sanctuary the fortress and remove the constant feature
and they will put in place the disgusting thing that causes desolation
32  and those who act wickedly against the covenant he will lead into apostasy by means of smooth words
but the people who know their god will prevail and act effectively
33  and those having insight among the people will impart understanding to the many
and they will be made to stumble by sword and by flame by captivity and by plundering for some days
34  but when they are made to stumble they will be given a little help and many will join with them by means of smooth speech
35  and some of those having insight will be made to stumble in order to do a refining work because of them and to do a cleansing and a whitening until the time of the end because it is yet for the time appointed
36  the king will do as he pleases and he will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and against the god of gods he will speak astonishing things
and he will prove successful until the denunciation comes to a finish because what is determined must take place
37  he will show no regard for the god of his fathers nor will he show regard for the desire of women or for any other god but he will magnify himself over everyone
38  but instead he will give glory to the god of fortresses to a god that his fathers did not know he will give glory by means of gold and silver and precious stones and desirable things
39  he will act effectively against the most fortified strongholds along with a foreign god
he will give great glory to those who give him recognition and he will make them rule among many and the ground he will apportion out for a price
40  in the time of the end the king of the south will engage with him in a pushing and against him the king of the north will storm with chariots and horsemen and many ships and he will enter into the lands and sweep through like a flood
41  he will also enter into the land of the decoration and many lands will be made to stumble
but these are the ones that will escape out of his hand eʹdom and moʹab and the main part of the amʹmonites
42  and he will keep thrusting out his hand against the lands and as regards the land of egypt she will not escape
43  and he will rule over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the desirable things of egypt
and the libʹyans and the ethioʹpians will be at his steps
44  but reports out of the east and out of the north will disturb him and he will go out in a great rage to annihilate and to devote many to destruction
45  and he will plant his royal tents between the grand sea and the holy mountain of decoration and he will come all the way to his end and there will be no helper for him
8  in the third year of the kingship of king belshazʹzar a vision appeared to me daniel after the one that appeared to me previously
2  i saw the vision and as i watched i was in shuʹshan the citadel which is in the province of eʹlam i viewed the vision and i was next to the watercourse of uʹlai
3  as i raised my eyes look there was a ram standing before the watercourse and it had two horns
the two horns were tall but one was higher than the other and the higher one came up later
4  i saw the ram making thrusts to the west and to the north and to the south and no wild beasts could stand before it and there was no one who could provide rescue from its power
it did as it pleased and exalted itself
5  as i kept watching look there was a male goat coming from the west crossing the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground
and the goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes
6  it was coming toward the ram with the two horns which i had seen standing before the watercourse it was running toward it in a powerful rage
7  i saw it closing in on the ram and it was filled with bitterness toward it
it struck down the ram and broke its two horns and the ram was powerless to stand up to it
it threw the ram to the ground and trampled it down and there was no one to rescue it from its power
8  then the male goat exalted itself exceedingly but as soon as it became mighty the great horn was broken then four conspicuous horns came up instead of the one toward the four winds of the heavens
9  out of one of them came another horn a small one and it grew very great toward the south and toward the east and toward the decoration
10  it grew so great that it reached all the way to the army of the heavens and it caused some of the army and some of the stars to fall to the earth and it trampled them down
11  it exalted itself even against the prince of the army and from him the constant feature was taken away and the established place of his sanctuary was thrown down
12  and an army was given over together with the constant feature because of transgression and it kept throwing truth to the earth and it acted and had success
13  and i heard a holy one speaking and another holy one said to the one speaking how long will the vision of the constant feature and of the transgression causing desolation continue to make both the holy place and the army things to trample on
14  so he said to me until 2300 evenings and mornings and the holy place will certainly be restored to its right condition
15  while i daniel was watching the vision and seeking to understand it suddenly i saw standing in front of me someone who appeared to be a man
16  then i heard the voice of a man in the midst of the uʹlai and he called out gaʹbriel make that one understand what he saw
17  so he came near to where i was standing but when he came i was so terrified that i fell facedown
he said to me understand o son of man that the vision is for the time of the end
18  but while he was speaking with me i fell fast asleep with my face to the ground
so he touched me and made me stand up where i had been standing
19  then he said here i am causing you to know what will happen in the final part of the denunciation because it is for the appointed time of the end
20  the twohorned ram that you saw stands for the kings of meʹdia and persia
21  the hairy male goat stands for the king of greece and the great horn that was between its eyes stands for the first king
22  as for the horn that was broken so that four stood up instead of it there are four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up but not with his power
23  and in the final part of their kingdom as the transgressors act to a completion a fiercelooking king who understands ambiguous sayings will stand up
24  his power will become great but not through his own power
he will bring ruin in an extraordinary way and he will be successful and act effectively
he will bring mighty ones to ruin also the people made up of the holy ones
25  and by his cunning he will use deception to succeed and in his heart he will exalt himself and during a time of security he will bring many to ruin
he will even stand up against the prince of princes but he will be broken without human hand
26  what was said in the vision about the evenings and the mornings is true but you must keep the vision secret for it refers to a time many days from now
27  as for me daniel i felt exhausted and i was sick for some days
then i got up and carried out the kings work but i was numbed by what i had seen and no one could understand it
9  in the first year of dariʹus the son of ahasueʹrusa descendant of the medes who had been made king over the kingdom of the chaldeʹans
2  in the first year of his reign i daniel discerned by the books the number of years mentioned in the word of jehovah to jeremiah the prophet to fulfill the desolation of jerusalem namely 70 years
3  so i turned my face to jehovah the true god entreating him in prayer along with fasting and sackcloth and ashes
4  i prayed to jehovah my god and made confession and said o jehovah the true god the great and aweinspiring one who keeps his covenant and shows loyal love to those who love him and keep his commandments
5  we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled and we have deviated from your commandments and your judgments
6  we have not listened to your servants the prophets who spoke in your name to our kings our princes our forefathers and all the people of the land
7  to you o jehovah belongs righteousness but to us belongs shame as is the case today to the men of judah the inhabitants of jerusalem and all israel those nearby and far away in all the lands to which you dispersed them because they acted unfaithfully toward you
8  o jehovah to us belongs shame to our kings our princes and our forefathers because we have sinned against you
9  to jehovah our god belong mercy and forgiveness for we have rebelled against him
10  we have not obeyed the voice of jehovah our god by following his laws that he set before us through his servants the prophets
11  all israel has overstepped your law and turned away by not obeying your voice so that you poured out on us the curse and the sworn oath written about in the law of moses the servant of the true god for we have sinned against him
12  he has carried out his words that he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled over us by bringing great calamity on us nothing has ever been done under the whole heavens such as what was done in jerusalem
13  just as it is written in the law of moses all this calamity has come upon us yet we have not begged for the favor of jehovah our god by turning away from our error and by showing insight into your truth
14  so jehovah kept watchful and brought calamity on us for jehovah our god is righteous in all the works that he has done yet we have not obeyed his voice
15  now o jehovah our god the one who brought your people out of the land of egypt by a mighty hand and made a name for yourself down to this day we have sinned and acted wickedly
16  o jehovah according to all your righteous acts please may your anger and wrath turn away from your city jerusalem your holy mountain for because of our sins and the errors of our forefathers jerusalem and your people are an object of reproach to all those around us
17  and now listen o our god to the prayer of your servant and to his entreaties and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate for your own sake o jehovah
18  incline your ear o my god and hear do open your eyes and see our desolate condition and the city that has been called by your name for we are not entreating you because of our righteous acts but because of your great mercy
19  o jehovah do hear
o jehovah do forgive
o jehovah do pay attention and act do not delay for your own sake o my god for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people
20  while i was still speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and making my request for favor before jehovah my god concerning the holy mountain of my god
21  yes while i was yet speaking in prayer the man gaʹbriel whom i had previously seen in the vision came to me when i was extremely weary at about the time of the evening gift offering
22  and he gave me understanding saying o daniel now i have come to give you insight and understanding
23  when you began your entreaty the word went out and i have come to report it to you because you are someone very precious
so consider the matter and understand the vision
24  there are 70 weeks that have been determined for your people and your holy city in order to terminate the transgression to finish off sin to make atonement for error to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and the prophecy and to anoint the holy of holies
25  you should know and understand that from the issuing of the word to restore and to rebuild jerusalem until messiʹah the leader there will be 7 weeks also 62 weeks
she will be restored and rebuilt with a public square and moat but in times of distress
26  and after the 62 weeks messiʹah will be cut off with nothing for himself
and the people of a leader who is coming will destroy the city and the holy place
and its end will be by the flood
and until the end there will be war what is decided upon is desolations
27  and he will keep the covenant in force for the many for one week and at the half of the week he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease
and on the wing of disgusting things there will be the one causing desolation and until an extermination what was decided on will be poured out also on the one lying desolate
7  in the first year of king belshazʹzar of babylon daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay on his bed
then he wrote down the dream he recorded a complete account of the matters
2  daniel declared i was watching in my visions during the night and look the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the vast sea
3  and four huge beasts came out of the sea each different from the others
4  the first one was like a lion and it had the wings of an eagle
i watched until its wings were plucked out and it was lifted up from the earth and was made to stand up on two feet like a man and it was given the heart of a man
5  and look another beast a second one like a bear
it was raised up on one side and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth and it was told get up eat much flesh
6  after this i kept watching and look another beast like a leopard but on its back it had four wings like those of a bird
and the beast had four heads and it was given authority to rule
7  after this i kept watching in the visions of the night and i saw a fourth beast fearsome and terrifying and unusually strong and it had large iron teeth
it was devouring and crushing and what was left it trampled down with its feet
it was different from all the other beasts that were prior to it and it had ten horns
8  while i considered the horns look another horn a small one came up among them and three of the first horns were plucked up from before it
and look there were eyes like human eyes in this horn and there was a mouth speaking arrogantly
9  i kept watching until thrones were set in place and the ancient of days sat down
his clothing was white like snow and the hair of his head was like clean wool
his throne was flames of fire its wheels were a burning fire
10  a stream of fire was flowing and going out from before him
a thousand thousands kept ministering to him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him
the court took its seat and books were opened
11  i kept watching at that time because of the sound of the arrogant words that the horn was speaking i watched until the beast was killed and its body was destroyed and it was given over to be burned in the fire
12  but as for the rest of the beasts their rulerships were taken away and their lives were prolonged for a time and a season
13  i kept watching in the visions of the night and look with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man was coming and he gained access to the ancient of days and they brought him up close before that one
14  and to him there were given rulership honor and a kingdom that the peoples nations and language groups should all serve him
his rulership is an everlasting rulership that will not pass away and his kingdom will not be destroyed
15  as for me daniel my spirit was distressed within me because the visions of my head frightened me
16  i went near to one of those who were standing there to ask him about the true meaning of this
so he replied and made known to me the interpretation of these things
17  these huge beasts four in number are four kings who will stand up from the earth
18  but the holy ones of the supreme one will receive the kingdom and they will possess the kingdom forever yes forever and ever
19  then i wanted to know more about the fourth beast which was different from all the others it was extraordinarily fearsome with iron teeth and copper claws and it was devouring and crushing and trampling down what was left with its feet
20  and about the ten horns on its head and the other horn that came up and before which three fell the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly and whose appearance was bigger than that of the others
21  i kept watching as that horn made war on the holy ones and it was prevailing against them
22  until the ancient of days came and judgment was rendered in favor of the holy ones of the supreme one and the appointed time arrived for the holy ones to take possession of the kingdom
23  this is what he said as for the fourth beast there is a fourth kingdom that will come to be on the earth
it will be different from all the other kingdoms and it will devour all the earth and will trample it down and crush it
24  as for the ten horns ten kings will rise up out of that kingdom and still another one will rise up after them and he will be different from the first ones and he will humiliate three kings
25  he will speak words against the most high and he will continually harass the holy ones of the supreme one
he will intend to change times and law and they will be given into his hand for a time times and half a time
26  but the court sat and they took away his rulership in order to annihilate him and to destroy him completely
27  and the kingdom and the rulership and the grandeur of the kingdoms under all the heavens were given to the people who are the holy ones of the supreme one
their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all rulerships will serve and obey them
28  this is the end of the matter
as for me daniel my thoughts alarmed me greatly so that i turned pale but i kept the matter in my own heart
6  it seemed good to dariʹus to appoint 120 satraps over the whole kingdom
2  over them were three high officials one of whom was daniel and the satraps would report to them so that the king would not suffer loss
3  now daniel was distinguishing himself over the other high officials and the satraps for there was an extraordinary spirit in him and the king intended to elevate him over the entire kingdom
4  at that time the high officials and the satraps were seeking to find some grounds for accusation against daniel respecting matters of state but they could find no grounds for accusation or anything corrupt for he was trustworthy and no negligence or corruption could be found in him
5  these men then said we will find in this daniel no grounds for accusation at all unless we find it against him in the law of his god
6  so these high officials and satraps went in as a group to the king and they said to him o king dariʹus may you live on forever
7  all the royal officials prefects satraps high royal officers and governors have consulted together to establish a royal decree and to enforce a ban that for 30 days whoever makes a petition to any god or man except to you o king should be thrown into the lions pit
8  now o king may you establish the decree and sign it so that it cannot be changed according to the law of the medes and the persians which cannot be annulled
9  so king dariʹus signed the decree and the ban
10  but as soon as daniel knew that the decree had been signed he went to his house which had the windows of his roof chamber open toward jerusalem
and three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed and offered praise before his god as he had regularly done prior to this
11  at that time those men burst in and found daniel petitioning and pleading for favor before his god
12  so they approached the king and reminded him about the royal ban did you not sign a ban stating that for 30 days any man who makes a petition to any god or man except to you o king should be thrown into the lions pit the king replied the matter is wellestablished according to the law of the medes and the persians which cannot be annulled
13  they immediately said to the king daniel who is of the exiles of judah has paid no regard to you o king nor to the ban that you signed but three times a day he is praying
14  as soon as the king heard this he was greatly distressed and he tried to think of a way to rescue daniel and until the sun set he made every effort to save him
15  finally those men went in as a group to the king and they said to the king take note o king that the law of the medes and the persians is that any ban or decree that the king establishes cannot be changed
16  so the king gave the order and they brought daniel and threw him into the pit of lions
the king said to daniel your god whom you are continually serving will rescue you
17  then a stone was brought and placed over the entrance of the pit and the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet ring of his nobles so that nothing could be changed with regard to daniel
18  the king then went to his palace
he passed the night fasting and refused any entertainment and he could not sleep
19  finally at the first light of dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions pit
20  as he got near the pit he called out to daniel with a sad voice
the king asked daniel o daniel servant of the living god has your god whom you are continually serving been able to rescue you from the lions
21  daniel immediately said to the king o king may you live on forever
22  my god sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions and they have not harmed me for i was found innocent before him nor have i done any wrong to you o king
23  the king was overjoyed and he commanded that daniel be lifted up out of the pit
when daniel was lifted up out of the pit he was completely unharmed because he had trusted in his god
24  the king then gave an order and the men who had accused daniel were brought and they were thrown into the lions pit along with their sons and their wives
they had not reached the bottom of the pit before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones
25  then king dariʹus wrote to all the peoples nations and language groups dwelling throughout the earth may you have abundant peace
26  i am issuing an order that in every domain of my kingdom people are to tremble in fear before the god of daniel
for he is the living god and he endures forever
his kingdom will never be destroyed and his rulership is eternal
27  he rescues saves and performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth for he rescued daniel from the paw of the lions
28  so this daniel prospered in the kingdom of dariʹus and in the kingdom of cyrus the persian
5  as regards king belshazʹzar he held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles and he was drinking wine in front of them
2  while under the influence of the wine belshazʹzar gave an order to bring in the vessels of gold and silver that his father nebuchadnezʹzar had taken from the temple in jerusalem so that the king and his nobles his concubines and his secondary wives could drink from them
3  then they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of the house of god in jerusalem and the king and his nobles his concubines and his secondary wives drank from them
4  they drank wine and they praised the gods of gold and silver of copper iron wood and stone
5  at that very moment the fingers of a mans hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the wall of the kings palace opposite the lampstand and the king could see the back of the hand as it was writing
6  then the king turned pale and his thoughts terrified him and his hips shook and his knees began to knock together
7  the king called out loudly to summon the conjurers the chaldeʹans and the astrologers
the king said to the wise men of babylon any man who reads this writing and tells me its interpretation will be clothed with purple a gold necklace will be placed around his neck and he will rule as the third one in the kingdom
8  then all the wise men of the king came in but they were not able to read the writing or to make known the interpretation to the king
9  so king belshazʹzar was very frightened and his face turned pale and his nobles were perplexed
10  because of the words of the king and his nobles the queen entered the banqueting hall
the queen said o king may you live on forever
do not let your thoughts terrify you nor let your face turn pale
11  there is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of holy gods
in the days of your father enlightenment and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of gods were found in him
king nebuchadnezʹzar your father appointed him as chief of the magicpracticing priests conjurers chaldeʹans and astrologers your father did this o king
12  for daniel whom the king named belteshazʹzar had an extraordinary spirit and knowledge and insight to interpret dreams to explain riddles and to solve knotty problems
now let daniel be summoned and he will tell you the interpretation
13  so daniel was brought in before the king
the king asked daniel are you daniel of the exiles of judah whom my father the king brought out of judah
14  i have heard concerning you that the spirit of gods is in you and that enlightenment and insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you
15  now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me to read this writing and to make its interpretation known to me but they are not able to tell the interpretation of the message
16  but i have heard concerning you that you are able to provide interpretations and to solve knotty problems
now if you are able to read the writing and to make its interpretation known to me you will be clothed with purple a gold necklace will be placed around your neck and you will rule as the third one in the kingdom
17  daniel then replied to the king you may keep your gifts and give your presents to others
however i will read the writing to the king and make known its interpretation to him
18  as for you o king the most high god granted to nebuchadnezʹzar your father the kingdom and greatness and honor and majesty
19  because of the greatness he gave him all peoples nations and language groups trembled with fear before him
whomever he wanted he killed or let live and whomever he wanted he exalted or humiliated
20  but when his heart became haughty and his spirit became hardened so that he acted presumptuously he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom and his dignity was taken away from him
21  he was driven away from mankind and his heart was made like that of a beast and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys
he was given vegetation to eat just like bulls and his body became wet with the dew of the heavens until he came to know that the most high god is ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he sets up over it whomever he wants
22  but you his son belshazʹzar have not humbled your heart although you knew all of this
23  instead you exalted yourself against the lord of the heavens and you had them bring you the vessels of his house
then you and your nobles your concubines and your secondary wives drank wine from them and praised gods of silver and gold of copper iron wood and stone gods that see nothing and hear nothing and know nothing
but you have not glorified the god in whose hand is your breath and all your ways
24  so the hand was sent from him and this writing was inscribed
25  and this is the writing that was inscribed meʹne meʹne teʹkel and parʹsin
26  this is the interpretation of the words meʹne god has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end
27  teʹkel you have been weighed in the balances and found lacking
28  peʹres your kingdom has been divided and given to the medes and the persians
29  then belshazʹzar gave the command and they clothed daniel with purple and placed a gold necklace around his neck and they heralded concerning him that he was to become the third ruler in the kingdom
30  that very night belshazʹzar the chaldeʹan king was killed
31  and dariʹus the mede received the kingdom he was about 62 years old
1  in the third year of the kingship of king jehoiʹakim of judah king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon came to jerusalem and besieged it
2  in time jehovah gave king jehoiʹakim of judah into his hand along with some of the utensils of the house of the true god and he brought them to the land of shiʹnar to the house of his god
he placed the utensils in the treasury of his god
3  then the king ordered ashʹpenaz his chief court official to bring some of the israelites including those of royal and noble descent
4  they were to be youths without any defect of good appearance endowed with wisdom knowledge and discernment and capable of serving in the kings palace
he was to teach them the writing and the language of the chaldeʹans
5  furthermore the king assigned to them a daily ration from the kings delicacies and from the wine he drank
they were to be trained for three years and at the end of that time they were to enter the kings service
6  now among them were some from the tribe of judah daniel hananiʹah mishʹael and azariʹah
7  and the principal court official assigned names to them he gave to daniel the name belteshazʹzar to hananiʹah the name shaʹdrach to mishʹael the name meʹshach and to azariʹah the name abedʹnego
8  but daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the kings delicacies or with the wine he drank
so he asked the principal court official for permission not to defile himself in this way
9  and the true god caused the principal court official to show daniel favor and mercy
10  but the principal court official said to daniel i am afraid of my lord the king who has assigned your food and drink
what if he should see you looking worse in appearance than the other youths of your age you would make me guilty before the king
11  but daniel said to the guardian whom the principal court official had appointed over daniel hananiʹah mishʹael and azariʹah
12  please test your servants for ten days and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink
13  then compare our appearance with the appearance of the youths who are eating the kings delicacies and deal with your servants according to what you see
14  so he agreed to their proposal and tested them for ten days
15  at the end of ten days their appearance was better and healthier than all the youths who were eating the kings delicacies
16  so the guardian would take away their delicacies and their wine and give them vegetables
17  and the true god gave these four youths knowledge and insight into every kind of writing and wisdom and daniel was given understanding in all sorts of visions and dreams
18  at the end of the time that the king had specified to bring them in the principal court official brought them in before nebuchadnezʹzar
19  when the king spoke with them no one in the entire group was found to be like daniel hananiʹah mishʹael and azariʹah and they continued to serve before the king
20  in every matter requiring wisdom and understanding that the king would ask them about he found them ten times better than all the magicpracticing priests and the conjurers in his entire realm
21  and daniel remained there until the first year of king cyrus
2  in the second year of his kingship nebuchadnezʹzar had a number of dreams and he was so agitated that he could not sleep
2  so the king gave the order to summon the magicpracticing priests the conjurers the sorcerers and the chaldeʹans to tell the king his dreams
so they came in and stood before the king
3  then the king said to them i have had a dream and i am agitated because i want to know what i dreamed
4  the chaldeʹans replied to the king in the aramaʹic language o king may you live on forever
relate the dream to your servants and we will tell the interpretation
5  the king answered the chaldeʹans this is my final word if you do not make the dream known to me along with its interpretation you will be dismembered and your houses will be turned into public latrines
6  but if you do tell the dream and its interpretation you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor
so tell me the dream and its interpretation
7  they answered a second time let the king relate the dream to his servants and we will tell its interpretation
8  the king replied i am wellaware that you are trying to gain time for you realize what my final word is
9  if you do not make the dream known to me there is only one penalty for all of you
but you have agreed to tell me something false and deceitful until the situation changes
so tell me the dream and i will know that you can explain its interpretation
10  the chaldeʹans answered the king there is not a man on earth who is able to do what the king demands for no great king or governor has asked such a thing of any magicpracticing priest or conjurer or chaldeʹan
11  what the king is asking is difficult and no one exists who could tell the king this except the gods who do not dwell among mortals
12  at this the king flew into a violent rage and gave the order to destroy all the wise men of babylon
13  when the order was issued and the wise men were about to be killed they also looked for daniel and his companions to put them to death
14  at that time daniel discreetly and cautiously spoke to arʹioch the chief of the kings bodyguard who had gone out to kill the wise men of babylon
15  he asked arʹioch the officer of the king why is there such a harsh order from the king then arʹioch informed daniel about the matter
16  so daniel went in and asked the king to grant him time to tell the interpretation to the king
17  daniel then went to his house and informed his companions hananiʹah mishʹael and azariʹah of the matter
18  he asked them to pray for mercy from the god of heaven concerning this secret so that daniel and his companions would not be destroyed along with the rest of the wise men of babylon
19  then the secret was revealed to daniel in a vision at night
so daniel praised the god of heaven
20  daniel declared let the name of god be praised for all eternityfor wisdom and mightiness are his alone
21  he changes times and seasonsremoves kings and sets up kingsgives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those with discernment
22  he reveals the deep things and the hidden thingshe knows what is in the darknessand with him the light dwells
23  to you o god of my forefathers i offer thanks and praisebecause you have given me wisdom and power
and now you have made known to me what we requested of youyou have made known to us the concern of the king
24  daniel then went in to arʹioch whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of babylon and he said to him do not destroy any wise men of babylon
take me in before the king and i will tell the interpretation to the king
25  arʹioch quickly took daniel in before the king and said to him i have found a man of the exiles of judah who can make known the interpretation to the king
26  the king said to daniel whose name was belteshazʹzar can you really make known to me the dream that i saw and its interpretation
27  daniel replied to the king none of the wise men conjurers magicpracticing priests or astrologers are able to tell the king the secret that he is asking
28  but there is a god in the heavens who is a revealer of secrets and he has made known to king nebuchadnezʹzar what is to happen in the final part of the days
this is your dream and these are the visions of your head as you lay on your bed
29  as for you o king on your bed your thoughts turned to what is to take place in the future and the revealer of secrets has made known to you what is to happen
30  as for me this secret was not revealed to me because i have greater wisdom than anyone living rather it was to make the interpretation known to the king so that you may know the thoughts in your heart
31  you o king were watching and you saw an immense image
that image which was huge and extremely bright was standing in front of you and its appearance was terrifying
32  the head of that image was of fine gold its chest and its arms were of silver its abdomen and its thighs were of copper
33  its legs were of iron and its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay
34  you looked on until a stone was cut out not by hands and it struck the image on its feet of iron and of clay and crushed them
35  at that time the iron the clay the copper the silver and the gold were all together crushed and became like the chaff from the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them could be found
but the stone that struck the image became a large mountain and it filled the whole earth
36  this is the dream and we will now tell the king its interpretation
37  you o kingthe king of kings to whom the god of heaven has given the kingdom the might the strength and the glory
38  and into whose hand he has given men wherever they may dwell as well as the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens and whom he has made ruler over all of themyou yourself are the head of gold
39  but after you another kingdom will rise inferior to you then another kingdom a third one of copper that will rule over the whole earth
40  as for the fourth kingdom it will be strong like iron
for just as iron crushes and pulverizes everything else yes like iron that shatters it will crush and shatter all of these
41  and just as you saw the feet and the toes to be partly of clay of a potter and partly of iron the kingdom will be divided but some of the hardness of iron will be in it just as you saw the iron mixed with soft clay
42  and as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile
43  just as you saw iron mixed with soft clay they will be mixed with the people but they will not stick together one to the other just as iron does not mix with clay
44  in the days of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed
and this kingdom will not be passed on to any other people
it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms and it alone will stand forever
45  just as you saw that out of the mountain a stone was cut not by hands and that it crushed the iron the copper the clay the silver and the gold
the grand god has made known to the king what will happen in the future
the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy
46  then king nebuchadnezʹzar fell down with his face to the ground before daniel and paid homage to him
and he gave the order to offer a present and incense to him
47  the king said to daniel truly your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of secrets because you were able to reveal this secret
48  the king then elevated daniel and gave him many fine gifts and he made him the ruler over all the province of babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of babylon
49  and at daniels request the king appointed shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego over the administration of the province of babylon but daniel served in the kings court
3  nebuchadnezʹzar the king made an image of gold that was 60 cubits high and 6 cubits wide
he set it up on the plain of duʹra in the province of babylon
2  then king nebuchadnezʹzar sent word to assemble the satraps prefects governors advisers treasurers judges magistrates and all the administrators of the provinces to come to the inauguration of the image that king nebuchadnezʹzar had set up
3  so the satraps prefects governors advisers treasurers judges magistrates and all the administrators of the provinces assembled for the inauguration of the image that king nebuchadnezʹzar had set up
and they stood in front of the image that nebuchadnezʹzar had set up
4  the herald loudly proclaimed you are commanded o peoples nations and language groups
5  that when you hear the sound of the horn pipe zither triangular harp stringed instrument bagpipe and all the other musical instruments you must fall down and worship the image of gold that king nebuchadnezʹzar has set up
6  whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace
7  so when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn pipe zither triangular harp stringed instrument and all the other musical instruments all the peoples nations and language groups fell down and worshipped the image of gold that king nebuchadnezʹzar had set up
8  now at that time some of the chaldeʹans came forward and accused the jews
9  they said to king nebuchadnezʹzar o king may you live on forever
10  you o king gave the command that every man who hears the sound of the horn pipe zither triangular harp stringed instrument bagpipe and all the other musical instruments should fall down and worship the image of gold
11  and that whoever would not fall down and worship should be thrown into the burning fiery furnace
12  but there are certain jews whom you appointed to administer the province of babylon shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego
these men have paid no regard to you o king
they are not serving your gods and they refuse to worship the image of gold that you have set up
13  then nebuchadnezʹzar in a furious rage ordered shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego to be brought in
so these men were brought in before the king
14  nebuchadnezʹzar said to them is it really true shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego that you are not serving my gods and that you refuse to worship the image of gold that i have set up
15  now when you hear the sound of the horn the pipe the zither the triangular harp the stringed instrument the bagpipe and all the other musical instruments if you are ready to fall down and worship the image that i have made fine
but if you refuse to worship you will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace
and who is the god who can rescue you out of my hands
16  shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego answered the king o nebuchadnezʹzar we have no need to answer you in this matter
17  if it must be our god whom we serve is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace o king and to rescue us from your hand
18  but even if he does not let it be known to you o king that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold that you have set up
19  then nebuchadnezʹzar became so furious with shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego that the expression of his face changed toward them and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual
20  he ordered some of the mighty men from his army to bind shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego and to throw them into the burning fiery furnace
21  so these men were tied up while still wearing their cloaks garments caps and all their other clothing and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace
22  because the kings command was so harsh and the furnace was exceptionally hot the men who took up shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego were the ones killed by the flames of the fire
23  but these three men shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego fell bound into the burning fiery furnace
24  king nebuchadnezʹzar then became frightened and quickly rose up and said to his high officials did we not tie up three men and throw them into the fire they answered the king yes o king
25  he said look i see four men walking about free in the midst of the fire and they are unharmed and the fourth one looks like a son of the gods
26  nebuchadnezʹzar approached the door of the burning fiery furnace and said shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego you servants of the most high god step out and come here shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego stepped out from the midst of the fire
27  and the satraps prefects governors and the high officials of the king who were assembled there saw that the fire had had no effect on the bodies of these men not a hair of their heads had been singed their cloaks looked no different and there was not even the smell of fire on them
28  nebuchadnezʹzar then declared praised be the god of shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego who sent his angel and rescued his servants
they trusted in him and went against the command of the king and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own god
29  i am therefore issuing an order that any people nation or language group that says anything against the god of shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego should be dismembered and their houses should be turned into public latrines for there is no other god who is able to rescue like this one
30  the king then promoted shaʹdrach meʹshach and abedʹnego in the province of babylon
12  during that time miʹchael will stand up the great prince who is standing in behalf of your people
and there will occur a time of distress such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time
and during that time your people will escape everyone who is found written down in the book
2  and many of those asleep in the dust of the earth will wake up some to everlasting life and others to reproach and to everlasting contempt
3  and those having insight will shine as brightly as the expanse of heaven and those bringing the many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever
4  as for you daniel keep the words secret and seal up the book until the time of the end
many will rove about and the true knowledge will become abundant
5  then i daniel looked and saw two others standing there one on this bank of the stream and one on the other bank of the stream
6  then one said to the man clothed in linen who was up above the waters of the stream how long will it be to the end of these marvelous things
7  then i heard the man clothed in linen who was up above the waters of the stream as he raised his right hand and his left hand to the heavens and swore by the one who is alive forever it will be for an appointed time appointed times and half a time
as soon as the dashing to pieces of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things will come to their finish
8  now as for me i heard but i could not understand so i said o my lord what will be the outcome of these things
9  then he said go daniel because the words are to be kept secret and sealed up until the time of the end
10  many will cleanse themselves and whiten themselves and will be refined
and the wicked ones will act wickedly and none of the wicked will understand but those having insight will understand
11  and from the time that the constant feature has been removed and the disgusting thing that causes desolation has been put in place there will be 1290 days
12  happy is the one who keeps in expectation and who arrives at the 1335 days
13  but as for you go on to the end
you will rest but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days
