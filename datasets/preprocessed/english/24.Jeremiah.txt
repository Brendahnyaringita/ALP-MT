10  hear the word that jehovah has spoken against you o house of israel
2  this is what jehovah says do not learn the way of the nationsand do not be terrified by the signs of the heavensbecause the nations are terrified by them
3  for the customs of the peoples are a delusion
it is just a tree of the forest that is cut downworked by the hands of the craftsman with his tool
4  they adorn it with silver and goldand fasten it with hammer and nails so that it will not fall over
5  like a scarecrow in a cucumber field they cannot speakthey have to be carried for they cannot walk
do not fear them for they can do no harmnor can they do any good
6  no one is like you o jehovah
you are great and your name is great and mighty
7  who should not fear you o king of the nations for it is fittingbecause among all the wise ones of the nations and among all their kingdomsthere is no one at all like you
8  they are all unreasoning and stupid
instruction from a tree is an utter delusion
9  silver plates are imported from tarʹshish and gold from uʹphazthe work of a craftsman of the hands of a metalworker
their clothing is blue thread and purple wool
they are all made by skilled workers
10  but jehovah is truly god
he is the living god and the eternal king
because of his indignation the earth will quakeand no nations will endure his denunciation
11  this is what you should say to them the gods that did not make the heavens and the earthwill perish from the earth and from under these heavens
12  he is the maker of the earth by his powerthe one who established the productive land by his wisdomand who stretched out the heavens by his understanding
13  when he makes his voice heardthe waters in the heavens are in turmoiland he causes clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth
he makes lightning for the rainand he brings the wind out of his storehouses
14  every man acts unreasonably and without knowledge
every metalworker will be put to shame because of the carved imagefor his metal image is a falsehoodand there is no spirit in them
15  they are a delusion a work of mockery
when their day of reckoning comes they will perish
16  the share of jacob is not like these thingsfor he is the one who formed everythingand israel is the staff of his inheritance
jehovah of armies is his name
17  gather up your bundle from the groundo woman dwelling under siege
18  for this is what jehovah says here i am hurling the inhabitants out of the land at this timeand i will cause them to experience distress
19  woe to me because of my breakdown my wound is incurable
and i said surely this is my sickness and i must bear it
20  my tent has been devastated and my tent cords have all been torn apart
my sons have left me and are no more
there is no one left to stretch out my tent or raise up my tent cloths
21  for the shepherds have behaved senselesslyand they have not inquired of jehovah
that is why they have not acted with insightand all their flocks have been scattered
22  listen a report it is coming a great pounding from the land of the northto make the cities of judah desolate a lair of jackals
23  i well know o jehovah that mans way does not belong to him
it does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step
24  correct me o jehovah with judgmentbut not in your anger that you may not reduce me to nothing
25  pour out your wrath on the nations who ignore youand on the families who do not call on your name
for they have devoured jacobyes they have devoured him to the point of exterminationand they have desolated his homeland
4  if you will return o israel declares jehovahif you will return to meand if you will remove your disgusting idols from before methen you will not be a fugitive
2  and if you swearas surely as jehovah is alive in truth justice and righteousnessthen the nations will obtain a blessing for themselves by himand in him they will boast
3  for this is what jehovah says to the men of judah and to jerusalem plow for yourselves arable landand do not keep sowing among thorns
4  circumcise yourselves to jehovahand remove the foreskins of your heartsyou men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalemso that my wrath may not blaze up like a fireand burn with no one to extinguish itbecause of your evil deeds
5  declare it in judah and proclaim it in jerusalem
shout and blow a horn throughout the land
call out loudly and say gather togetherand let us flee into the fortified cities
6  raise a signal toward zion
seek shelter and do not stand still for i am bringing in calamity from the north a great crash
7  he has emerged like a lion from his thicketthe destroyer of nations has set out
he has gone out from his place to make your land an object of horror
your cities will be reduced to ruins without an inhabitant
8  therefore put on sackclothmourn and wailbecause the burning anger of jehovah has not turned away from us
9  in that day declares jehovah the heart of the king will fail himalso the heart of the princesthe priests will be horrified and the prophets will be amazed
10  then i said alas o sovereign lord jehovah truly you have utterly deceived this people and jerusalem saying you will have peace when the sword is at our throats
11  at that time it will be said to this people and to jerusalem a scorching wind from the barren hills of the desertwill sweep down on the daughter of my peopleit is not coming to winnow or to cleanse
12  the full wind comes from these places at my bidding
now i will pronounce judgments against them
13  look he will come like rain cloudsand his chariots are like a storm wind
his horses are swifter than eagles
woe to us for we are ruined
14  wash your heart clean of wickedness o jerusalem in order to be saved
how long will you harbor wicked thoughts
15  for a voice tells the news from danand it proclaims disaster from the mountains of eʹphraim
16  report it yes to the nationsproclaim it against jerusalem
sentinels are coming from a distant landand they will raise their voices against the cities of judah
17  they come against her on all sides like guards of the open fieldbecause she has rebelled against me declares jehovah
18  your own ways and your actions will be brought upon you
how bitter is your disasterfor it reaches clear to your heart
19  o my anguish my anguish i feel great pain in my very heart
my heart pounds within me
i cannot keep silentfor i have heard the sound of the hornthe alarm signal of war
20  disaster after disaster has been reportedfor the whole land has been destroyed
suddenly my own tents are destroyedin a moment my tent cloths
21  how long will i keep seeing the signalkeep hearing the sound of the horn
22  for my people are foolishthey take no note of me
they are stupid sons with no understanding
they are clever enough when it comes to doing badbut they do not know how to do good
23  i saw the land and look it was empty and desolate
i looked at the heavens and their light was no more
24  i saw the mountains and look they were quakingand the hills were shaking
25  i saw and look there was no manand the birds of the heavens had all fled
26  i saw and look the orchard had become a wildernessand its cities had all been torn down
it was because of jehovahbecause of his burning anger
27  for this is what jehovah says the whole land will become desolatebut i will not carry out a complete extermination
28  for this reason the land will mournand the heavens above will become dark
it is because i have spoken i have decidedand i will not change my mind nor will i turn back from it
29  at the sound of the horsemen and the archersthe entire city flees
they enter into the thicketsand they climb the rocks
every city is abandonedand no man dwells in them
30  now that you are devastated what will you do you used to clothe yourself with scarletto deck yourself with gold ornamentsand to enlarge your eyes with black paint
but it is in vain that you beautified yourselffor those lusting after you have rejected youthey are now seeking to take your life
31  for i have heard the sound like that of a sick womanthe distress like that of a woman giving birth to her first childthe voice of the daughter of zion who keeps gasping for breath
she says as she spreads out her palms woe to me for i am exhausted because of the killers
26  in the beginning of the reign of jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judah this word came from jehovah
2  this is what jehovah says stand in the courtyard of the house of jehovah and speak concerning all the people of the cities of judah who are coming in to worship at the house of jehovah
tell them everything that i command you do not take away a word
3  perhaps they will listen and each one will turn back from his evil way and i will change my mind concerning the calamity that i intend to bring on them because of their evil deeds
4  say to them this is what jehovah says if you will not listen to me by following my law that i have placed before you
5  by listening to the words of my servants the prophets whom i am sending to you again and again whom you have not listened to
6  then i will make this house like shiʹloh and i will make this city an object of cursing to all the nations of the earth
7  and the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of jehovah
8  so when jeremiah had finished speaking all that jehovah had commanded him to speak to all the people then the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him and said you will surely die
9  why have you prophesied in the name of jehovah saying this house will become like shiʹloh and this city will be devastated and left without an inhabitant and all the people gathered around jeremiah in the house of jehovah
10  when the princes of judah heard these words they came up from the house of the king to the house of jehovah and sat down at the entrance of the new gate of jehovah
11  the priests and the prophets said to the princes and to all the people this man deserves the death penalty because he has prophesied against this city just as you have heard with your own ears
12  jeremiah then said to all the princes and to all the people it was jehovah who sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard
13  so now reform your ways and your actions and obey the voice of jehovah your god and jehovah will change his mind concerning the calamity that he has spoken against you
14  but as for me i am in your hand
do to me whatever seems good and right in your eyes
15  only know for certain that if you put me to death you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon her inhabitants for in truth jehovah sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing
16  then the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets this man does not deserve the death penalty for he spoke to us in the name of jehovah our god
17  furthermore some of the elders of the land rose up and began saying to the entire congregation of the people
18  miʹcah of moʹresheth was prophesying in the days of king hezekiʹah of judah and he said to all the people of judah this is what jehovah of armies says zion will be plowed up as a fieldjerusalem will become heaps of ruinsand the mountain of the house will become like high places in a forest
19  did king hezekiʹah of judah and all judah then put him to death did he not fear jehovah and beg for jehovahs favor so that jehovah changed his mind concerning the calamity that he had spoken against them so we are about to bring a great calamity on ourselves
20  and there was another man prophesying in the name of jehovah uriʹjah son of shemaiʹah from kirʹiathjeʹarim who prophesied against this city and against this land with words like those of jeremiah
21  king jehoiʹakim and all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words and the king sought to put him to death
when uriʹjah heard of it he at once became afraid and fled to egypt
22  then king jehoiʹakim sent elnaʹthan the son of achʹbor and other men with him to egypt
23  they brought uriʹjah from egypt and took him to king jehoiʹakim who then struck him down with the sword and cast his dead body into the graveyard of the common people
24  but ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan supported jeremiah so that he was not handed over to the people to be put to death
11  this is the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah saying
2  hear the words of this covenant you people speak them to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem
3  and say to them this is what jehovah the god of israel says cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant
4  which i commanded your forefathers on the day i brought them out of the land of egypt out of the ironsmelting furnace saying obey my voice and do all the things that i command you and you will become my people and i will be your god
5  so that i may fulfill the oath that i swore to your forefathers to give them the land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day
and i answered amen o jehovah
6  jehovah then said to me proclaim all these words in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem hear the words of this covenant and carry them out
7  for i solemnly admonished your forefathers in the day i brought them out of the land of egypt and to this day admonishing them again and again obey my voice
8  but they did not listen or incline their ear instead each kept stubbornly following his own wicked heart
so i brought on them all the words of this covenant that i commanded them to do but they refused to carry them out
9  jehovah then said to me there is a conspiracy among the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem
10  they have returned to the errors of their forefathers of old who refused to obey my words
they too have followed other gods and have served them
the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant that i made with their forefathers
11  therefore this is what jehovah says here i am bringing on them a calamity that they will not be able to escape
when they call to me for help i will not listen to them
12  then the cities of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will go to the gods to which they are making sacrifices and call for help but these will by no means save them in the time of their calamity
13  for your gods have become as many as your cities o judah and you have set up as many altars to the shameful thing as there are streets in jerusalem altars to make sacrifices to baʹal
14  as for you do not pray in behalf of this people
do not cry out in their behalf or offer a prayer for them for i will not be listening when they call out to me because of their calamity
15  what right does my beloved one have to be in my housewhen so many have carried out evil schemes with holy flesh will they avert the calamity when it comes upon you will you exult at that time
16  jehovah once called you a thriving olive treebeautiful with fine fruit
with a great roaring sound he has set her on fireand they have broken its branches
17  jehovah of armies your planter has declared that a calamity will come upon you because of the evil committed by the house of israel and the house of judah who have offended me by making sacrifices to baʹal
18  jehovah informed me so that i would knowat that time you caused me to see what they were doing
19  i was like a docile lamb being brought to the slaughter
i did not know that they were scheming against me let us destroy the tree with its fruitand let us cut him off from the land of the livingso that his name may be remembered no more
20  but jehovah of armies judges with righteousnesshe examines the innermost thoughts and the heart
let me see your vengeance on themfor to you i have committed my legal case
21  therefore this is what jehovah says against the men of anʹathoth who are seeking to take your life and who say you must not prophesy in the name of jehovah or you will die by our hand
22  therefore this is what jehovah of armies says here i am going to call them to account
the young men will die by the sword and their sons and their daughters will die by famine
23  not even a remnant will be left of them because i will bring calamity on the men of anʹathoth in the year of their being called to account
49  for the amʹmonites this is what jehovah says does israel have no sons does he have no heir why has malʹcam taken possession of gad and why are his people living in israels cities
2  therefore look the days are coming declares jehovahwhen i will cause the alarm signal of war to be heard against rabʹbah of the amʹmonites
she will become a desolate moundand her dependent towns will be set on fire
and israel will take possession of those who dispossessed him says jehovah
3  wail o heshʹbon for aʹi has been destroyed cry out o dependent towns of rabʹbah
put on sackcloth
wail and rove about among the stone pensfor malʹcam will go into exiletogether with his priests and his princes
4  why do you brag about the valleysabout your flowing plain o unfaithful daughterwho trusts in her treasuresand who says who will come against me
5  here i am bringing something dreadful on you declares the sovereign lord jehovah of armiesfrom all those around you
you will be dispersed in every directionand no one will gather those who flee
6  but afterward i will gather the captives of the amʹmonites declares jehovah
7  for eʹdom this is what jehovah of armies says is there no longer any wisdom in teʹman has good advice perished from those with understanding has their wisdom rotted
8  flee turn back go and dwell down in the depths o inhabitants of deʹdan for i will bring disaster on eʹsauwhen the time comes to turn my attention to him
9  if grape gatherers came in to youwould they not leave some behind for gleaning if thieves came in by nightthey would cause only as much ruin as they wanted
10  but i will strip eʹsau bare
i will uncover his places of concealmentso that he cannot hide
his children and his brothers and his neighbors will all be destroyedand he will be no more
11  leave your fatherless childrenand i will preserve them aliveand your widows will trust in me
12  for this is what jehovah says look if those not sentenced to drink the cup must drink it should you be left completely unpunished you will not be left unpunished for you must drink it
13  for by myself i have sworn declares jehovah that bozʹrah will become an object of horror a reproach a devastation and a curse and all her cities will become perpetual ruins
14  i have heard a report from jehovahan envoy has been sent among the nations saying gather yourselves together and come against herprepare for battle
15  for look i have made you insignificant among the nationsdespised among men
16  the shuddering you caused has deceived youthe presumptuousness of your hearto you who reside in the retreats of the cragoccupying the highest hill
although you build your nest high up like an eaglei will bring you down from there declares jehovah
17  and eʹdom must become an object of horror
everyone passing along by her will stare in horror and whistle on account of all her plagues
18  just as in the overthrow of sodʹom and gomorʹrah and of their neighboring towns jehovah says no one will dwell there and no man will settle there
19  look someone will come up against the secure pastures like a lion from the dense thickets along the jordan but in a moment i will make him run away from her
and i will appoint over her the chosen one
for who is like me and who will challenge me what shepherd can stand before me
20  therefore hear o men the decision that jehovah has made against eʹdom and what he has thought out against the inhabitants of teʹman surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away
he will make their dwelling place desolate because of them
21  at the sound of their falling the earth has quaked
there is an outcry the sound has been heard as far as the red sea
22  look just like an eagle he will ascend and swoop downand he will spread out his wings over bozʹrah
in that day the heart of the warriors of eʹdomwill become like the heart of a woman in childbirth
23  for damascus haʹmath and arʹpad have been put to shamefor they have heard a bad report
they melt in fear
there is anxiety in the sea that cannot be calmed
24  damascus has lost courage
she has turned to flee but panic has seized her
distress and pain have taken hold of herlike a woman who is giving birth
25  how is it that the city of praise has not been abandonedthe town of exultation
26  for her young men will fall in her public squaresand all the soldiers will perish in that day declares jehovah of armies
27  i will set the wall of damascus on fireand it will consume the fortified towers of benhaʹdad
28  for keʹdar and the kingdoms of haʹzor which king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon struck down this is what jehovah says rise up go up to keʹdarand destroy the sons of the east
29  their tents and their flocks will be takentheir tent cloths and all their goods
their camels will be carried offand they will cry out to them terror is all around
30  flee go far away go and dwell down in the depths o inhabitants of haʹzor declares jehovah
for king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon has devised a strategy against youand he has thought out a plan against you
31  rise up go up against the nation that is at peacedwelling in security declares jehovah
it has no doors or bars they live in isolation
32  their camels will become plunderand their abundant livestock a spoil
i will scatter them to every windthose who clip their hair at the templesand i will bring their disaster from every direction declares jehovah
33  and haʹzor will become a lair of jackalsa perpetual desolation
no one will dwell thereand no man will settle in her
34  this is the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning eʹlam in the beginning of the reign of king zedekiʹah of judah
35  this is what jehovah of armies says here i am breaking the bow of eʹlam the source of their mightiness
36  i will bring in on eʹlam the four winds from the four extremities of the heavens and i will scatter them to all these winds
there will not be a nation to which the dispersed ones of eʹlam will not go
37  i will shatter the eʹlamites before their enemies and before those seeking to take their life and i will bring calamity on them my burning anger declares jehovah
and i will send the sword after them until i have exterminated them
38  and i will set my throne in eʹlam and i will destroy from there the king and the princes declares jehovah
39  but in the final part of the days i will gather the captives of eʹlam declares jehovah
8  at that time declares jehovah the bones of the kings of judah the bones of its princes the bones of the priests the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem will be taken from their graves
2  they will be spread out to the sun and to the moon and to all the army of the heavens that they loved and served and followed and sought after and bowed down to
they will not be gathered nor will they be buried
they will become like manure on the surface of the ground
3  and the remnant of this evil family who survive will choose death over life in all the places where i disperse them declares jehovah of armies
4  and you must say to them this is what jehovah says will they fall and not get up again if one would turn back will the other not also turn back
5  why is this people jerusalem unfaithful with an enduring unfaithfulness they hold fast to deceptionthey refuse to turn back
6  i paid attention and kept listening but the way they spoke was not right
not a man repented over his wickedness or asked what have i done each one keeps returning to the popular course like a horse dashing into the battle
7  even the stork in the sky knows its seasonsthe turtledove and the swift and the thrush keep to the time of their return
but my own people do not understand the judgment of jehovah
8  how can you say we are wise and we have the law of jehovah for in fact the lying stylus of the scribes has been used only for falsehood
9  the wise have been put to shame
they have become terrified and will be caught
look they have rejected the word of jehovahand what wisdom do they have
10  so i will give their wives to other mentheir fields to other ownersfor from the least to the greatest each one is making dishonest gainfrom the prophet to the priest each one is practicing fraud
11  and they try to heal the breakdown of the daughter of my people lightly sayingthere is peace there is peace when there is no peace
12  do they feel ashamed of the detestable things they have done they feel no shame at all they do not even know how to feel humiliated so they will fall among the fallen
when i bring punishment on them they will stumble says jehovah
13  when i gather them i will bring them to their end declares jehovah
there will be no grapes left on the vine no figs on the fig tree and the leaves will wither
and what i gave to them will be lost to them
14  why are we sitting here let us gather together and enter the fortified cities and perish there
for jehovah our god will do away with usand he gives us poisoned water to drinkbecause we have sinned against jehovah
15  there was a hope for peace but nothing good camefor a time of healing but there is terror
16  from dan is heard the snorting of his horses
at the sound of the neighing of his stallionsthe whole land quakes
they come in and devour the land and everything in itthe city and its inhabitants
17  for here i am sending in serpents among youpoisonous snakes that cannot be charmedand they will certainly bite you declares jehovah
18  my grief is incurablemy heart is sick
19  from a distant land there is a cry for helpfrom the daughter of my people is jehovah not in zion or is her king not in her why have they offended me with their graven imageswith their worthless foreign gods
20  the harvest has passed the summer has endedbut we have not been saved
21  i am shattered over the breakdown of the daughter of my peoplei am dejected
horror has seized me
22  is there no balsam in gilʹead or is there no healer there why has the daughter of my people not been restored to health
30  the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah saying
2  this is what jehovah the god of israel says write in a book all the words that i speak to you
3  for look the days are coming declares jehovah when i will gather the captives of my people israel and judah says jehovah and i will bring them back to the land that i gave to their forefathers and they will possess it once again
4  these are the words that jehovah spoke to israel and judah
5  this is what jehovah says we have heard the sounds of tremblingthere is terror and no peace
6  ask please whether a man can give birth
why then do i see every strong man with his hands on his stomachlike a woman giving birth why has every face turned pale
7  alas for that day is a terrible one
there is none like ita time of distress for jacob
but he will be saved out of it
8  and in that day declares jehovah of armies i will break the yoke from off your neck and your straps i will tear in two and no more will strangers make him their slave
9  they will serve jehovah their god and david their king whom i will raise up for them
10  and you my servant jacob do not be afraid declares jehovahand do not be terrified o israel
for i will save you from far awayand your offspring from the land of their captivity
jacob will return and be calm and undisturbedwith no one to make them afraid
11  for i am with you declares jehovah to save you
but i will make an extermination among all the nations to which i scattered youhowever you i will not exterminate
i will discipline you to the proper degreeand i will by no means leave you unpunished
12  for this is what jehovah says there is no cure for your breakdown
your wound is incurable
13  there is no one to plead your causeno means of healing your ulcer
there is no cure for you
14  all your passionate lovers have forgotten you
they no longer seek you out
for with the stroke of an enemy i have struck youwith the punishment of someone cruelbecause of your great guilt and your many sins
15  why do you cry out because of your breakdown your pain is incurable because of your great guilt and your many sinsi have done this to you
16  therefore all those devouring you will be devouredand all your enemies will also go into captivity
those pillaging you will be pillagedand i will hand all those plundering you over to plundering
17  but i will restore your health and heal your wounds declares jehovahthough they called you an outcast zion for whom no one searches
18  this is what jehovah says here i am gathering the captives of the tents of jacoband i will have pity for his tabernacles
the city will be rebuilt on her moundand the fortified tower will stand on its rightful site
19  and from them will come thanksgiving and the sounds of laughter
i will multiply them and they will not be fewi will make them numerousand they will not be insignificant
20  his sons will become as in the pastand before me his assembly will be firmly established
i will deal with all his oppressors
21  his majestic one will be one of his ownand from his midst his ruler will emerge
i will cause him to come near and he will approach me
for otherwise who would dare to approach me declares jehovah
22  and you will become my people and i will be your god
23  look a windstorm of jehovah will burst out in furya sweeping tempest that whirls down on the head of the wicked
24  the burning anger of jehovah will not turn backuntil he has carried out and accomplished the intentions of his heart
in the final part of the days you will understand this
16  the word of jehovah again came to me saying
2  you must not take a wife for yourself and you must not have sons and daughters in this place
3  for this is what jehovah says concerning the sons and daughters who are born here and concerning their mothers who give birth to them and concerning their fathers who cause their birth in this land
4  they will die of deadly diseases but no one will mourn them or bury them they will become like manure on the surface of the ground
they will perish by the sword and by famine and their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth
5  for this is what jehovah saysdo not enter a house where a mourners feast is heldand do not go to wail or offer sympathy
for i have taken away my peace from this people declares jehovahas well as my loyal love and mercy
6  both the great and the small will die in this land
they will not be buriedno one will mourn themnor will anyone cut himself or make himself bald for them
7  and no one will provide food for those in mourningto comfort them over their deadnor will anyone give them the cup of consolationto drink over the loss of their father or mother
8  and do not enter a house of feastingto sit down with them to eat and drink
9  for this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says here in this place in your days and before your very eyes i will put an end to the sounds of exultation and rejoicing the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride
10  when you tell this people all these words they will ask you why has jehovah spoken of all this great calamity against us what error and what sin have we committed against jehovah our god
11  you must reply to them because your forefathers abandoned me declares jehovah and they kept following other gods and serving them and bowing down to them
but me they abandoned and my law they did not keep
12  and you have behaved far worse than your forefathers and each one of you follows the stubbornness of his wicked heart instead of obeying me
13  so i will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your forefathers have known and there you will have to serve other gods day and night because i will show you no favor
14  however the days are coming declares jehovah when they will no longer say as surely as jehovah is alive who brought the people of israel out of the land of egypt
15  but rather as surely as jehovah is alive who brought the people of israel from the land of the north and from all the lands to which he had dispersed them and i will bring them back to their land which i gave to their forefathers
16  here i am sending for many fishermen declares jehovahand they will fish for them
after that i will send for many huntersand they will hunt them down on every mountain and every hilland out of the clefts of the crags
17  for my eyes are on everything they do
they have not been hidden from before menor has their error been hidden from my eyes
18  first i will repay the full amount due for their error and their sinfor they have profaned my land with the lifeless figures of their disgusting idolsand have filled my inheritance with their detestable things
19  o jehovah my strength and my strongholdmy place to flee in the day of distressto you the nations will come from the ends of the earthand they will say our forefathers inherited utter falsehoodfutility and useless things of no benefit
20  can a man make gods for himselfwhen they are not really gods
21  so i will make them knowat this time i will make them know my power and my mightand they will have to know that my name is jehovah
35  the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah in the days of jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judah saying
2  go to the house of the reʹchabites and speak with them and bring them into the house of jehovah into one of the dining rooms then offer them wine to drink
3  so i took jaazaniʹah the son of jeremiah the son of habazziniʹah his brothers all his sons and the entire house of the reʹchabites
4  into the house of jehovah
i brought them to the dining room of the sons of haʹnan the son of igdaliʹah a man of the true god which was next to the dining room of the princes that was above the dining room of maaseiʹah the son of shalʹlum the doorkeeper
5  then i put cups and goblets full of wine before the men of the house of the reʹchabites and said to them drink wine
6  but they said we will not drink wine because jehonʹadab the son of reʹchab our forefather gave us this command neither you nor your sons must ever drink wine
7  and you must not build a house sow seed or plant or obtain a vineyard
instead you must always dwell in tents so that you may live for a long time in the land where you are residing as foreigners
8  so we continue to obey the voice of jehonʹadab the son of our forefather reʹchab in all that he commanded us by never drinking any winewe our wives our sons and our daughters
9  and we do not build houses to dwell in nor do we have vineyards or fields or seed
10  we keep living in tents and obeying all that jehonʹadab our forefather commanded us
11  but when king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon came up against the land we said come let us go into jerusalem to escape the army of the chaldeʹans and of the syrians and now we are living in jerusalem
12  and the word of jehovah came to jeremiah saying
13  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says go and say to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem were you not continually urged to obey my words declares jehovah
14  jehonʹadab the son of reʹchab commanded his descendants not to drink wine and they have carried out his words by not drinking it to this day thus obeying the order of their forefather
however i have spoken to you again and again but you have not obeyed me
15  and i kept sending all my servants the prophets to you sending them again and again saying turn back please each of you from your evil ways and do what is right do not walk after other gods and serve them
then you will keep dwelling in the land that i gave to you and your forefathers
but you did not incline your ear or listen to me
16  the descendants of jehonʹadab the son of reʹchab have carried out the order that their forefather gave them but these people have not listened to me
17  therefore this is what jehovah the god of armies the god of israel says here i am bringing on judah and on all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the calamity that i have warned them about for i have spoken to them but they would not listen and i kept calling to them but they would not answer
18  and jeremiah said to the household of the reʹchabites this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says because you have obeyed the order of your forefather jehonʹadab and you continue to observe all his orders doing exactly what he ordered you
19  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says there will never fail to be a descendant of jehonʹadab the son of reʹchab to serve in my presence
18  this is the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah
2  rise up and go down to the house of the potter and there i will cause you to hear my words
3  so i went down to the house of the potter and he was working on the potters wheels
4  but the vessel that the potter was making with the clay was spoiled in his hand
so the potter reworked it into another vessel just as he saw fit
5  then the word of jehovah came to me saying
6  can i not do to you just as this potter did o house of israel declares jehovah
look as the clay in the hand of the potter so are you in my hand o house of israel
7  whenever i may speak about uprooting and pulling down and destroying a nation or a kingdom
8  and that nation abandons its wickedness that i spoke against i will also change my mind concerning the calamity that i intended to bring against it
9  but whenever i speak about building up and planting a nation or a kingdom
10  and it does what is bad in my eyes and does not obey my voice i will change my mind concerning the good that i intended to do for it
11  now say please to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem this is what jehovah says here i am preparing a calamity and devising a scheme against you
turn back please from your bad ways and reform your ways and your practices
12  but they said it is hopeless for we will walk after our own thoughts and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his wicked heart
13  therefore this is what jehovah says ask for yourselves please among the nations
who has heard anything like this the virgin of israel has done a most horrible thing
14  does the snow of lebʹanon disappear from the rocks on its slopes or will cool waters flowing from afar dry up
15  but my people have forgotten me
for they make sacrifices to something worthlessand they make men stumble in their ways the ancient pathsto walk on back roads that are not smooth and level
16  in order to make their land an object of horrorand something to whistle at forever
every last one passing by it will stare in horror and shake his head
17  like the east wind i will scatter them before the enemy
i will show them my back not my face in the day of their disaster
18  and they said come let us devise a plot against jeremiah for the law will not perish from our priests or counsel from the wise men or the word from the prophets
come and let us speak against him and pay no attention to what he says
19  do pay attention to me o jehovahand listen to what my opponents are saying
20  should good be repaid with bad for they have dug a pit for my life
remember how i stood before you to speak good about themto turn your wrath away from them
21  so give their sons over to the famineand hand them over to the power of the sword
may their wives become bereaved of children and widowed
may their men be killed with deadly plaguetheir young men struck down with the sword in battle
22  let a cry be heard from their houseswhen you bring marauders on them suddenly
for they have dug a pit to capture meand have laid traps for my feet
23  but you o jehovahwell know all their schemes against me to kill me
do not cover their errorand do not wipe out their sin from before you
let them stumble before youwhen you take action against them in your anger
17  the sin of judah is written down with an iron stylus
with a diamond point it is engraved on the tablet of their heartand on the horns of their altars
2  while their sons remember their altars and their sacred polesbeside a luxuriant tree on the high hills
3  on the mountains in the open countryside
your resources all your treasures i will give as plunderyes your high places because of sin throughout your territories
4  you will forfeit of your own accord your inheritance that i gave you
and i will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not knowfor you have kindled my anger like a fire
it will burn for all time
5  this is what jehovah says cursed is the man who puts his trust in mere humanswho relies on human powerand whose heart turns away from jehovah
6  he will become like a solitary tree in the desert
he will not see when good comesbut he will reside in parched places in the wildernessin a salt land where no one can live
7  blessed is the man who puts his trust in jehovahwhose confidence is in jehovah
8  he will become like a tree planted by the watersthat sends out its roots to the stream
he will not notice when heat comesbut his leaves will always flourish
and in the year of drought he will not be anxiousnor will he quit producing fruit
9  the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate
who can know it
10  i jehovah am searching the heartexamining the innermost thoughtsto give to each one according to his waysaccording to the fruitage of his works
11  like a partridge that gathers what it has not laidso is the one who acquires riches dishonestly
they will leave him in midlifeand in the end he will prove senseless
12  a glorious throne exalted from the beginningis the place of our sanctuary
13  o jehovah the hope of israelall those who abandon you will be put to shame
those apostatizing from you will be written in the dustbecause they have abandoned jehovah the source of living water
14  heal me o jehovah and i will be healed
save me and i will be savedfor you are the object of my praise
15  look there are those saying to me where is the word of jehovah let it come please
16  but as for me i did not run away from following you as a shepherdnor did i long for the day of disaster
you well know everything my lips have spokenit all took place before your face
17  do not be a cause of terror to me
you are my refuge in the day of calamity
18  let my persecutors be put to shamebut do not let me be put to shame
let them be struck with terrorbut do not let me be struck with terror
bring the day of calamity on themand crush them and destroy them completely
19  this is what jehovah told me go and stand in the gate of the sons of the people by which the kings of judah go in and out and in all the gates of jerusalem
20  you must say to them hear the word of jehovah you kings of judah all people of judah and all inhabitants of jerusalem who enter by these gates
21  this is what jehovah says watch yourselves and do not carry any load on the sabbath day or bring it in through the gates of jerusalem
22  you must not bring any load out of your homes on the sabbath day and you must do no work at all
keep the sabbath day sacred just as i commanded your forefathers
23  but they did not listen or incline their ear and they stubbornly refused to obey or to accept discipline
24  however if you strictly obey me declares jehovah and you bring in no load through the gates of this city on the sabbath day and you keep the sabbath day sacred by not doing any work on it
25  then kings and princes who sit on the throne of david will also enter in through the gates of this city riding in the chariot and on horses they and their princes the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and this city will be inhabited for all time
26  and people will come from the cities of judah from the places around jerusalem from the land of benjamin from the lowland from the mountainous region and from the negʹeb bringing whole burnt offerings sacrifices grain offerings frankincense and thanksgiving sacrifices into the house of jehovah
27  but if you do not obey me by keeping the sabbath day sacred and by not carrying loads and bringing them through the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day i will set her gates on fire and it will certainly consume the fortified towers of jerusalem and will not be extinguished
50  the word that jehovah spoke concerning babylon concerning the land of the chaldeʹans through jeremiah the prophet
2  declare it among the nations and proclaim it
raise a signal and proclaim it
do not hide anything say babylon has been captured
bel has been put to shame
merʹodach has become terrified
her images have been put to shame
her disgusting idols have become terrified
3  for a nation has come against her from the north
it makes her land an object of horrorno one is dwelling in her
both man and beast have taken flightthey have gone away
4  in those days and at that time declares jehovah the people of israel and the people of judah will come together
they will weep as they walk and together they will seek jehovah their god
5  they will ask the way to zion with their faces turned in that direction saying come and let us join ourselves to jehovah in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten
6  my people have become a flock of lost sheep
their own shepherds caused them to stray
they led them away onto the mountains roaming from mountain to hill
they have forgotten their restingplace
7  all those finding them have devoured them and their enemies have said we are not guilty because they sinned against jehovah against the dwelling place of righteousness and the hope of their forefathers jehovah
8  flee out of the midst of babylongo out of the land of the chaldeʹansand be like the leading animals before the flock
9  for here i am raising up and bringing against babylonan assembly of great nations from the land of the north
they will come against her in battle formationfrom there she will be captured
their arrows are like those of a warriorcausing bereavement of childrenthey do not come back without results
10  chaldeʹa will become a spoil
all those taking spoil from her will be fully satisfied declares jehovah
11  for you kept rejoicing you kept exultingwhen pillaging my own inheritance
for you kept pawing like a heifer in the grassand you kept neighing like stallions
12  your mother has been put to shame
she who gave birth to you has been disappointed
look she is the least of the nationsa waterless wilderness and a desert
13  because of the indignation of jehovah she will not be inhabitedshe will become utterly desolate
anyone passing by babylon will stare in horrorand whistle because of all her plagues
14  come against babylon in battle formation on every sideall you who are bending the bow
shoot at her spare no arrowfor it is against jehovah that she has sinned
15  shout a war cry against her on every side
she has surrendered
her pillars have fallen her walls are torn downfor it is the vengeance of jehovah
take your vengeance on her
do to her just as she has done
16  cut off the sower from babylonand the one handling the sickle in harvesttime
because of the cruel sword each will return to his own peopleeach one will flee to his own land
17  the people of israel are scattered sheep
lions have dispersed them
first the king of assyrʹia devoured them then king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon gnawed on their bones
18  therefore this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says here i will deal with the king of babylon and with his land in the same way that i dealt with the king of assyrʹia
19  and i will bring israel back to his pasture and he will graze on carʹmel and on baʹshan and on the mountains of eʹphraim and of gilʹead he will be satisfied
20  in those days and at that time declares jehovahisraels guilt will be searched forbut there will be noneand the sins of judah will not be foundfor i will forgive those whom i let remain
21  go up against the land of merathaʹim and against the inhabitants of peʹkod
let them be massacred and completely destroyed declares jehovah
do all that i have commanded you
22  there is the sound of war in the landa great catastrophe
23  how the forge hammer of all the earth has been cut down and broken how babylon has become an object of horror among the nations
24  i have laid a snare for you and you have been caught o babylonand you did not know it
you were found and capturedfor it was jehovah whom you opposed
25  jehovah has opened his storehouseand he brings out the weapons of his indignation
for the sovereign lord jehovah of armies has a workin the land of the chaldeʹans
26  come against her from distant places
open up her granaries
pile her up like heaps of grain
destroy her completely
may she have no one left
27  massacre all her young bullslet them go down to the slaughter
woe to them for their day has cometheir time of reckoning
28  there is the sound of those fleeingthose escaping from the land of babylonto declare in zion the vengeance of jehovah our godthe vengeance for his temple
29  summon archers against babylonall who are bending the bow
camp all around her let no one escape
repay her according to her activity
do to her just as she has done
for she has acted arrogantly against jehovahagainst the holy one of israel
30  so her young men will fall in her public squaresand all her soldiers will perish in that day declares jehovah
31  look i am against you o defiant one declares the sovereign lord jehovah of armiesfor your day must come the time that i will call you to account
32  you o defiant one will stumble and fallwith no one to raise you up
and i will set your cities on fireand it will consume everything around you
33  this is what jehovah of armies says the people of israel and judah are oppressedand all those taking them captive have held onto them
they have refused to let them go
34  but their repurchaser is strong
jehovah of armies is his name
he will surely plead their legal casein order to give rest to the landand to bring agitation to the inhabitants of babylon
35  there is a sword against the chaldeʹans declares jehovahagainst the inhabitants of babylon and against her princes and against her wise ones
36  there is a sword against the empty talkers and they will act foolishly
there is a sword against her warriors and they will become terrified
37  there is a sword against their horses and their war chariotsand against all the mixed populations in her midstand they will become like women
there is a sword against her treasures and they will be plundered
38  there is a devastation on her waters and they will be dried up
for it is a land of graven imagesand because of their frightful visions they keep acting with madness
39  therefore the desert creatures will dwell with the howling animalsand in her the ostriches will dwell
she will never again be inhabitednor will she be a place of residence throughout all generations
40  just as with gods overthrow of sodʹom and gomorʹrah and of their neighboring towns declares jehovah no one will dwell there and no man will settle there
41  look a people is coming in from the northa great nation and grand kings will be raised upfrom the remotest parts of the earth
42  bow and javelin they wield
they are cruel and will show no mercy
their sound is like the roaring seaas they ride on their horses
like one man they line up in battle formation against you o daughter of babylon
43  the king of babylon has heard the report about themand his hands drop down
anguish seizes himpain like that of a woman giving birth
44  look someone will come up against the secure pastures like a lion from the dense thickets along the jordan but in a moment i will make them run away from her
and i will appoint over her the chosen one
for who is like me and who will challenge me what shepherd can stand before me
45  therefore hear o men the decision that jehovah has made against babylon and what he has thought out against the land of the chaldeʹans
surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away
he will make their dwelling place desolate because of them
46  at the sound of babylons capture the earth will quakeand an outcry will be heard among the nations
9  o that my head were watersmy eyes a fountain of tears then i would weep day and nightfor the slain ones of my people
2  o that i had a travelers lodging place in the wilderness then i would leave my people and go away from themfor they are all adulterersa band of treacherous people
3  they bend their tongue like a bowfalsehood not faithfulness prevails in the land
they advance from evil to eviland they pay no attention to me declares jehovah
4  everyone be on guard against your neighborand do not trust even your brother
for every brother is a betrayerand every neighbor is a slanderer
5  each one cheats his neighborand no one speaks truth
they have taught their tongue to speak falsehood
they wear themselves out doing what is wrong
6  you are living in the midst of deception
in their deception they refused to know me declares jehovah
7  therefore this is what jehovah of armies says i will smelt them and test themfor what else can i do with the daughter of my people
8  their tongue is a deadly arrow that speaks deception
with his mouth a person speaks of peace to his neighborbut inside he lays an ambush
9  should i not call them to account for these things declares jehovah
should i not avenge myself on such a nation
10  i will weep and lament over the mountainsand take up a dirge over the pastures of the wildernessfor they have been burned up so that no man passes throughand the sound of livestock is not heard
the birds of heaven and the beasts have fled they are gone
11  i will make jerusalem piles of stones the lair of jackalsand i will make the cities of judah desolate without an inhabitant
12  who is wise enough to understand this to whom has the mouth of jehovah spoken that he may declare it why has the land perished why is it scorched like the wildernessso that no one is passing through
13  jehovah replied because of their rejecting my law that i set before them and because they have not followed it and obeyed my voice
14  instead they stubbornly followed their own hearts and they followed the baʹal images as their fathers had taught them to do
15  therefore this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says here i am making this people eat wormwood and i will make them drink poisoned water
16  i will scatter them among the nations that they and their fathers have not known and i will send a sword after them until i will have exterminated them
17  this is what jehovah of armies saysbehave with understanding
summon the women who sing dirgesand send for the skilled women to come
18  so that they may hurry and raise a lamentation for usso that our eyes may stream with tearsand our eyelids trickle with water
19  for the sound of lamentation has been heard from zion how we have been devastated how great our shame is for we have left the land and they have thrown down our homes
20  you women hear the word of jehovah
may your ear receive the word of his mouth
teach your daughters this lamentationand teach one another this dirge
21  for death has come up through our windowsit has entered our fortified towersto take away the children from the streetsand the young men from the public squares
22  say this is what jehovah declares the dead bodies of people will fall like manure on the surface of the fieldlike a row of newly cut grain after the reaperwith no one to gather them up
23  this is what jehovah says let not the wise man boast about his wisdomlet not the mighty man boast about his mightinessand let not the rich man boast about his riches
24  but let the one boasting boast about this that he has insight and knowledge of methat i am jehovah the one showing loyal love justice and righteousness in the earthfor in these things i take delight declares jehovah
25  look days are coming declares jehovah and i will hold an accounting with everyone circumcised and yet uncircumcised
26  with egypt and judah and eʹdom and the amʹmonites and moʹab and with all of those with hair clipped at the temples who are dwelling in the wilderness for all the nations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in heart
28  in that same year in the beginning of the reign of king zedekiʹah of judah in the fourth year in the fifth month the prophet hananiʹah the son of azʹzur from gibʹeon said to me in the house of jehovah in the presence of the priests and all the people
2  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says i will break the yoke of the king of babylon
3  within two years i am bringing back to this place all the utensils of the house of jehovah that king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon took from this place and brought to babylon
4  and i will bring back to this place jeconiʹah son of jehoiʹakim the king of judah and all the exiles of judah who have gone to babylon declares jehovah for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon
5  then jeremiah the prophet spoke to hananiʹah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of jehovah
6  jeremiah the prophet said amen may jehovah do this may jehovah fulfill your words that you prophesied by bringing back from babylon to this place the utensils of the house of jehovah and all the exiled people
7  however hear please this message that i am speaking in your ears and in the ears of all the people
8  long ago the prophets who were prior to me and prior to you used to prophesy concerning many lands and great kingdoms about war calamity and pestilence
9  if a prophet prophesies about peace and the word of that prophet comes true then it will be known that jehovah truly sent that prophet
10  at that hananiʹah the prophet took the yoke bar off the neck of the prophet jeremiah and broke it
11  hananiʹah then said in the presence of all the people this is what jehovah says just like this i will break the yoke of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two years
and jeremiah the prophet went on his way
12  after hananiʹah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from off the neck of jeremiah the prophet this message of jehovah came to jeremiah
13  go and say to hananiʹah this is what jehovah says you have broken yoke bars of wood but instead of them you will make yoke bars of iron
14  for this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says i will put an iron yoke bar on the neck of all these nations to serve king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and they must serve him
even the wild beasts of the field i will give him
15  jeremiah the prophet then said to hananiʹah the prophet listen please o hananiʹah jehovah has not sent you but you have caused this people to trust in a lie
16  therefore this is what jehovah says look i am removing you from the face of the ground
this year you will die for you have urged rebellion against jehovah
17  so hananiʹah the prophet died in that year in the seventh month
27  in the beginning of the reign of jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judah this word came to jeremiah from jehovah
2  this is what jehovah has told me make for yourself straps and yoke bars and put them on your neck
3  then send them to the king of eʹdom the king of moʹab the king of the amʹmonites the king of tyre and the king of siʹdon by the hand of the messengers who have come to jerusalem to king zedekiʹah of judah
4  give them this command for their masters this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says this is what you should say to your masters
5  it is i who made the earth mankind and the beasts that are on the surface of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm and i have given it to whomever i please
6  and now i have given all these lands into the hand of my servant king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon even the wild beasts of the field i have given him to serve him
7  all the nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his own land comes when many nations and great kings will make him their slave
8  if any nation or kingdom refuses to serve king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and refuses to put its neck under the yoke of the king of babylon i will punish that nation with the sword with famine and with pestilence declares jehovah until i have finished them off by his hand
9  therefore do not listen to your prophets your diviners your dreamers your magicians and your sorcerers who are saying to you you will not serve the king of babylon
10  for they are prophesying lies to you so that you will be taken far away from your land and i will disperse you and you will perish
11  but the nation that brings its neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serves him i will allow to remain on its land declares jehovah to cultivate it and dwell in it
12  also to king zedekiʹah of judah i spoke in the same way saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and you will keep living
13  why should you and your people die by the sword by famine and by pestilence as jehovah has said about the nation that will not serve the king of babylon
14  do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you you will not serve the king of babylon because they are prophesying lies to you
15  for i have not sent them declares jehovah but they are prophesying lies in my name with the result that i will disperse you and you will perish you and the prophets who are prophesying to you
16  and to the priests and to all this people i said this is what jehovah says do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you look the utensils of the house of jehovah will be brought back from babylon very soon for they are prophesying lies to you
17  do not listen to them
serve the king of babylon and you will keep living
why should this city become a ruin
18  but if they are prophets and if the word of jehovah is with them please let them beg jehovah of armies that the remaining utensils in the house of jehovah in the house of the king of judah and in jerusalem may not be taken away to babylon
19  for this is what jehovah of armies says concerning the pillars the sea the carriages and the remaining utensils that are left in this city
20  which king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon did not take when he took into exile jeconiʹah son of jehoiʹakim the king of judah from jerusalem to babylon together with all the nobles of judah and jerusalem
21  yes this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says concerning the utensils that are left at the house of jehovah in the house of the king of judah and in jerusalem
22  to babylon they will be brought and there they will remain until the day i turn my attention to them declares jehovah
then i will bring them back and restore them to this place
7  this is the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah saying
2  stand in the gate of the house of jehovah and proclaim there this message hear the word of jehovah all you people of judah who enter these gates to bow down to jehovah
3  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says reform your ways and your actions and i will allow you to keep residing in this place
4  do not put your trust in deceptive words and say this is the temple of jehovah the temple of jehovah the temple of jehovah
5  for if you truly reform your ways and actions if you truly uphold justice between a man and his neighbor
6  if you do not oppress foreign residents orphans and widows if you do not shed innocent blood in this place and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm
7  then i will allow you to keep residing in this place in the land i gave to your forefathers for all time
8  but you are putting your trust in deceptive wordsit will bring absolutely no benefit
9  can you steal murder commit adultery swear falsely make sacrifices to baʹal and follow after gods you had not known
10  and then come and stand before me in this house that bears my name and say we will be saved despite your doing all these detestable things
11  has this house that bears my name become a cave of robbers in your eyes here i have seen it for myself declares jehovah
12  however go now to my place in shiʹloh where i first caused my name to reside and see what i did to it because of the badness of my people israel
13  but you kept doing all these things declares jehovah and even though i spoke to you again and again you did not listen
i kept calling you but you would not answer
14  so i will do to the house that bears my name in which you are trusting and to this place that i gave to you and your forefathers just as i did to shiʹloh
15  i will throw you out of my sight just as i threw out all your brothers all the descendants of eʹphraim
16  as for you do not pray in behalf of this people
do not cry out or offer a prayer or plead with me in their behalf for i will not listen to you
17  do you not see what they are doing in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
18  the sons are gathering wood the fathers are lighting the fire and the wives are kneading dough in order to make sacrificial cakes to the queen of heaven and they are pouring out drink offerings to other gods to offend me
19  but am i the one they are hurting declares jehovah
is it not they themselves to their own shame
20  therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says look my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place on man and beast on the trees of the field and the fruitage of the ground it will burn and will not be extinguished
21  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says go ahead add your whole burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the flesh yourselves
22  for on the day i brought your forefathers out of the land of egypt i did not speak with them or command them concerning whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
23  but i did give them this command obey my voice and i will become your god and you will become my people
you must walk in all the way that i command so that it may go well with you
24  but they did not listen or incline their ear instead they walked in their own schemes stubbornly following their wicked heart and they went backward not forward
25  from the day your forefathers came out of the land of egypt until this day
so i kept sending all my servants the prophets to you sending them each day again and again
26  but they refused to listen to me and they did not incline their ear
instead they were stubborn and they acted worse than their forefathers
27  you will speak all these words to them but they will not listen to you you will call to them but they will not answer you
28  and you will say to them this is the nation that did not obey the voice of jehovah their god and refused to accept discipline
faithfulness has perished and is not even mentioned among them
29  shear off your uncut hair and throw it away and on the bare hills raise a dirge for jehovah has rejected and will abandon this generation that has infuriated him
30  for the people of judah have done what is bad in my eyes declares jehovah
they have set up their disgusting idols in the house that bears my name in order to defile it
31  they have built the high places of toʹpheth which is in the valley of the son of hinʹnom in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire something that i had not commanded and that had never even come into my heart
32  therefore look the days are coming declares jehovah when it will no longer be called toʹpheth or the valley of the son of hinʹnom but the valley of the slaughter
they will bury in toʹpheth until there is no place left
33  and the dead bodies of this people will become food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth with no one to frighten them away
34  i will put an end to the sound of exultation and the sound of rejoicing the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for the land will be reduced to ruins
51  this is what jehovah says here i am raising up a destructive windagainst babylon and the inhabitants of lebkaʹmai
2  i will send winnowers to babylonand they will winnow her and make her land emptythey will come against her on all sides in the day of calamity
3  let the archer not bend his bow
and let no one stand up in his coat of mail
show no compassion for her young men
devote all her army to destruction
4  and they will fall slain in the land of the chaldeʹanspierced through in her streets
5  for israel and judah are not widowed from their god from jehovah of armies
but their land is full of guilt from the standpoint of the holy one of israel
6  flee out of the midst of babylonand escape for your life
do not perish because of her error
for it is the time for jehovahs vengeance
he is paying her back for what she has done
7  babylon has been a golden cup in the hand of jehovahshe made all the earth drunk
from her wine the nations have drunkthat is why the nations have gone mad
8  suddenly babylon has fallen and is broken
wail over her get balsam for her pain perhaps she may be healed
9  we tried to heal babylon but she could not be healed
leave her and let us go each to his own land
for her judgment has reached to the heavensit is as high as the clouds
10  jehovah has brought about justice for us
come let us recount in zion the work of jehovah our god
11  polish the arrows take up the circular shields
jehovah has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the medesbecause he intends to bring babylon to ruin
for this is the vengeance of jehovah the vengeance for his temple
12  lift up a signal against the walls of babylon
strengthen the guard post the watchmen
prepare those in ambush
for jehovah has devised the strategyand he will carry out what he has promised against the inhabitants of babylon
13  o woman who resides on many waterswith abundant treasuresyour end has come the limit of your profitmaking
14  jehovah of armies has sworn by himselfi will fill you with men as numerous as locustsand they will shout in triumph over you
15  he is the maker of the earth by his powerthe one who established the productive land by his wisdomand who stretched out the heavens by his understanding
16  when he makes his voice heardthe waters in the heavens are in turmoiland he causes clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth
he makes lightning for the rainand he brings the wind out of his storehouses
17  every man acts unreasonably and without knowledge
every metalworker will be put to shame because of the carved imagefor his metal image is a falsehoodand there is no spirit in them
18  they are a delusion a work of mockery
when their day of reckoning comes they will perish
19  the share of jacob is not like these thingsfor he is the one who formed everythingeven the staff of his inheritance
jehovah of armies is his name
20  you are a war club for me a weapon for battlefor with you i will smash nations
with you i will bring kingdoms to ruin
21  with you i will smash the horse and its rider
with you i will smash the war chariot and its rider
22  with you i will smash man and woman
with you i will smash old man and boy
with you i will smash young man and woman
23  with you i will smash shepherd and his flock
with you i will smash farmer and his team of animals
with you i will smash governors and deputy rulers
24  and i will repay babylon and all the inhabitants of chaldeʹafor all the evil that they have committed in zion before your eyes declares jehovah
25  here i am against you o destructive mountain declares jehovahyou destroyer of the whole earth
i will stretch out my hand against you and roll you down from the cragsand make you a burnedout mountain
26  people will not take from you a cornerstone or a foundation stonebecause you will become desolate forever declares jehovah
27  lift up a signal in the land
blow a horn among the nations
appoint the nations against her
summon against her the kingdoms of arʹarat minʹni and ashʹkenaz
commission against her a recruiting officer
make the horses come up like bristling locusts
28  appoint against her the nationsthe kings of meʹdia its governors and all its deputy rulersand all the lands they rule over
29  and the earth will quake and tremblefor the thoughts of jehovah against babylon will be carried outto make the land of babylon an object of horror without an inhabitant
30  the warriors of babylon have quit fighting
they sit in their strongholds
their strength has failed
they have become like women
her homes have been set on fire
her bars have been broken
31  one courier runs to meet another courierand one messenger to meet another messengerto report to the king of babylon that his city has been captured on every side
32  that the fords have been seizedthat the papyrus boats have been burned with fireand that the soldiers are terrified
33  for this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says the daughter of babylon is like a threshing floor
it is the time to tread her down solid
very soon the time of the harvest will come for her
34  king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon has devoured mehe has thrown me into confusion
he has set me down as an empty vessel
he has swallowed me down like a big snakehe has filled his stomach with my fine things
he has rinsed me away
35  may the violence done to me and to my person come upon babylon says the inhabitant of zion
and let my blood come upon the inhabitants of chaldeʹa says jerusalem
36  therefore this is what jehovah says here i am pleading your legal caseand i will execute vengeance for you
i will dry up her sea and make her wells dry
37  and babylon will become piles of stonesa lair of jackalsan object of horror and something to whistle atwithout an inhabitant
38  all together they will roar just like young lions
they will growl like lion cubs
39  when they are inflamed i will set out their banquet and make them drunkin order that they may exultthen they will sleep a lasting sleepfrom which they will not wake up declares jehovah
40  i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughterlike rams along with the goats
41  o how sheʹshach has been capturedhow the praise of the whole earth has been seized how babylon has become an object of horror among the nations
42  the sea has come up over babylon
by the multitude of its waves she has been covered
43  her cities have become an object of horror a waterless land and a desert
a land where no one will live and where no man will pass through
44  i will turn my attention to bel in babylonand i will take out of his mouth what he has swallowed
to him nations will stream no moreand the wall of babylon will fall
45  get out of her midst my people escape for your lives from the burning anger of jehovah
46  do not be fainthearted or afraid about the report to be heard in the land
in one year the report will comeand the next year another reportof violence in the land and of ruler against ruler
47  therefore look the days are comingwhen i will turn my attention to the graven images of babylon
all her land will be put to shameand all her slain will fall in her midst
48  the heavens and the earth and everything in themwill shout joyfully over babylonfor the destroyers will come to her out of the north declares jehovah
49  not only did babylon cause the slain of israel to fallbut also at babylon the slain ones of all the earth have fallen
50  you who escape the sword keep going do not stand still remember jehovah from far awayand may jerusalem come up into your heart
51  we have been put to shame for we have heard taunts
humiliation has covered our facesfor foreigners have come against the holy places of the house of jehovah
52  therefore look the days are coming declares jehovahwhen i will turn my attention to her graven imagesand throughout all her land the wounded will groan
53  even if babylon should ascend to the heavenseven if she should fortify her towering strongholdsfrom me her destroyers will come declares jehovah
54  listen there is an outcry from babylonthe sound of great disaster from the land of the chaldeʹans
55  for jehovah is destroying babylonhe will silence her great voiceand their waves will roar like many waters
the sound of their voice will be heard
56  for the destroyer will come upon babylonher warriors will be capturedtheir bows will be shatteredfor jehovah is a god of retribution
he will surely repay
57  i will make her princes and her wise men drunkher governors and her deputy rulers and her warriorsand they will sleep a lasting sleepfrom which they will not wake up declares the king whose name is jehovah of armies
58  this is what jehovah of armies says the wall of babylon though broad will be completely demolishedand her gates though high will be set on fire
the peoples will toil for nothingthe nations will weary themselves just to feed the fire
59  this is the word that jeremiah the prophet gave as a command to seraiʹah son of neriʹah son of mahseiʹah when he went with king zedekiʹah of judah to babylon in the fourth year of his reign seraiʹah was the quartermaster
60  jeremiah wrote in one book all the calamity that would come upon babylon all these words written against babylon
61  furthermore jeremiah said to seraiʹah when you come to babylon and see her you must read aloud all these words
62  then say o jehovah you have said against this place that it will be destroyed and left without an inhabitant man or beast and that she will become desolate forever
63  and when you finish reading this book tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the euphraʹtes
64  then say this is how babylon will sink down and never rise again because of the calamity that i am bringing on her and they will grow weary
down to this point are the words of jeremiah
34  the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah when king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against jerusalem and all her cities
2  this is what jehovah the god of israel says go and speak to king zedekiʹah of judah and tell him this is what jehovah says here i am giving this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he will burn it with fire
3  and you will not escape out of his hand for you will without fail be caught and handed over to him
and you will see the king of babylon eye to eye and he will speak to you facetoface and you will go to babylon
4  however hear the word of jehovah o king zedekiʹah of judah this is what jehovah says concerning you you will not die by the sword
5  in peace you will die and they will make a burning ceremony for you as they did for your fathers the former kings who were before you and they will mourn you alas o master for i have spoken the word declares jehovah
6  jeremiah the prophet then spoke all these words to king zedekiʹah of judah in jerusalem
7  when the armies of the king of babylon were fighting against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against laʹchish and against azeʹkah for they were the only fortified cities that remained of the cities of judah
8  the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah after king zedekiʹah had made a covenant with all the people in jerusalem to proclaim liberty to them
9  that everyone should free his hebrew slaves male and female so that no one would keep a fellow jew as his slave
10  so all the princes and all the people obeyed
they had entered into the covenant that everyone should free his male and female slaves and not keep them as slaves any longer
they obeyed and let them go
11  however they later brought back the male and female slaves whom they had freed and they again forced them back into slavery
12  so the word of jehovah came to jeremiah from jehovah saying
13  this is what jehovah the god of israel says i made a covenant with your forefathers in the day i brought them out of the land of egypt out of the house of slavery saying
14  at the end of seven years each of you should free his hebrew brother who was sold to you and who has served you six years you must set him free
but your forefathers did not listen or incline their ears to me
15  and recently you yourselves turned around and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty to your fellow men and you made a covenant before me in the house that bears my name
16  but then you turned around and profaned my name by bringing back your male and female slaves whom you had freed according to their desire and you forced them back into slavery
17  therefore this is what jehovah says you have not obeyed me in proclaiming liberty each one to his brother and to his fellow man
so i will now proclaim liberty to you declares jehovah to the sword to pestilence and to famine and i will make you an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth
18  and this is what will happen to the men who violated my covenant by not carrying out the words of the covenant that they made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between the halves
19  namely the princes of judah the princes of jerusalem the court officials the priests and all the people of the land who passed between the halves of the calf
20  i will hand them over to their enemies and to those seeking to take their lives and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth
21  and i will give king zedekiʹah of judah and his princes into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking to take their lives and into the hand of the armies of the king of babylon who are withdrawing from against you
22  here i will give the order declares jehovah and i will bring them back to this city and they will fight against it and capture it and burn it with fire and the cities of judah i will make a wasteland without an inhabitant
46  this is the word of jehovah to jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations
2  for egypt concerning the army of pharʹaoh neʹcho the king of egypt who was along the euphraʹtes river and was defeated at carʹchemish by king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon in the fourth year of jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judah
3  prepare your bucklers and large shieldsand advance to the battle
4  harness the horses and mount you horsemen
take your positions and put on your helmets
polish the lances and put on your coats of mail
5  why do i see them terrorstricken they are retreating their warriors are crushed
they have fled in panic their warriors have not turned around
there is terror all around declares jehovah
6  the swift cannot flee and the warriors cannot escape
in the north by the bank of the euphraʹtes riverthey have stumbled and fallen
7  who is this coming up like the nile riverlike the rivers of surging waters
8  egypt comes up just like the nile riverlike rivers of surging watersand it says i will go up and cover the earth
i will destroy the city and those inhabiting it
9  go up you horses drive madly you chariots let the warriors advancecush and put who handle the shieldand the luʹdim who handle and bend the bow
10  that day belongs to the sovereign lord jehovah of armies the day of vengeance for taking revenge on his adversaries
and the sword will devour and satisfy itself and take its fill of their blood for the sovereign lord jehovah of armies has a sacrifice in the land of the north by the euphraʹtes river
11  go up to gilʹead to get balsamo virgin daughter of egypt
in vain you have multiplied your remediesfor there is no cure for you
12  the nations have heard your dishonorand your outcry has filled the land
for warrior stumbles against warriorand they both fall down together
13  this is the word that jehovah spoke to jeremiah the prophet regarding the coming of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon to strike down the land of egypt
14  declare it in egypt proclaim it in migʹdol
proclaim it in noph and in tahʹpanhes
say take your positions and prepare yourselvesfor a sword will devour all around you
15  why have your powerful men been swept away they did not stand their groundfor jehovah has pushed them down
16  in great numbers they are stumbling and falling
they are saying to one another get up let us return to our people and our homelandbecause of the cruel sword
17  there they have proclaimedpharʹaoh king of egypt is just a meaningless noisewho has let the opportunity pass by
18  as surely as i am alive declares the king whose name is jehovah of armieshe will come in like taʹbor among the mountainsand like carʹmel by the sea
19  prepare your baggage for exileo daughter inhabiting egypt
for noph will become an object of horrorit will be set afire and left without an inhabitant
20  egypt is like a goodlooking heiferbut stinging flies will come against her from the north
21  even her hired soldiers in her midst are like fattened calvesbut they have also turned back and fled together
they could not stand their groundfor the day of their disaster has come upon themtheir time of reckoning
22  her sound is like that of a slithering serpentfor they come after her in force with axeslike men cutting down trees
23  they will cut down her forest declares jehovah though it seemed impenetrable
for they are more numerous than locusts without number
24  the daughter of egypt will be put to shame
she will be handed over to the people of the north
25  jehovah of armies the god of israel says now i am turning my attention to aʹmon from no to pharʹaoh to egypt to her gods and to her kingsyes to pharʹaoh and all those trusting in him
26  and i will hand them over to those seeking to take their life to king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and his servants
but afterward she will be inhabited as in times past declares jehovah
27  as for you do not be afraid my servant jacoband do not be terrified o israel
for i will save you from far awayand your offspring from the land of their captivity
jacob will return and be calm and undisturbedwith no one to make them afraid
28  so do not be afraid my servant jacob declares jehovah for i am with you
i will make an extermination among all the nations where i dispersed youbut you i will not exterminate
i will discipline you to the proper degreebut i will by no means leave you unpunished
37  and king zedekiʹah the son of josiʹah began to reign in place of coniʹah the son of jehoiʹakim for king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon made him king in the land of judah
2  but he and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of jehovah spoken through jeremiah the prophet
3  and king zedekiʹah sent jehuʹcal the son of shelemiʹah and zephaniʹah the son of maaseiʹah the priest to jeremiah the prophet saying please pray in our behalf to jehovah our god
4  jeremiah was moving about freely among the people for they had not yet put him in prison
5  now pharʹaohs army had set out from egypt and the chaldeʹans who were besieging jerusalem heard the report about them
so they withdrew from against jerusalem
6  then the word of jehovah came to jeremiah the prophet saying
7  this is what jehovah the god of israel says this is what you should say to the king of judah who sent you to me to inquire of me look the army of pharʹaoh that is coming to assist you will have to go back to their land egypt
8  and the chaldeʹans will come back and fight against this city and capture it and burn it with fire
9  this is what jehovah says do not deceive yourselves by saying the chaldeʹans will surely go away from against us because they will not go away
10  even if you were to strike down the entire army of the chaldeʹans who are fighting against you and only their wounded men were left they would still rise up from their tents and burn this city with fire
11  when the chaldeʹan army had withdrawn from against jerusalem because of pharʹaohs army
12  jeremiah set out from jerusalem to the land of benjamin to receive his portion there among his people
13  but when he reached the gate of benjamin the officer in charge of the guard whose name was iriʹjah the son of shelemiʹah the son of hananiʹah seized jeremiah the prophet and said you are deserting to the chaldeʹans
14  but jeremiah said it is not true i am not deserting to the chaldeʹans
but he did not listen to him
so iriʹjah arrested jeremiah and brought him in to the princes
15  the princes were furious with jeremiah and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of jehonʹathan the secretary which had been made into a prison
16  jeremiah was put into the dungeon into the vaulted rooms and he remained there many days
17  then king zedekiʹah sent for him and the king secretly questioned him in his house
he asked is there any word from jehovah jeremiah said there is and he continued you will be given into the hand of the king of babylon
18  jeremiah also said to king zedekiʹah how have i sinned against you and against your servants and against this people so that you have put me into the prison
19  where now are your prophets who prophesied to you the king of babylon will not come against you and against this land
20  now listen please o my lord the king
may you grant please my request for favor
do not send me back to the house of jehonʹathan the secretary or i will die there
21  so king zedekiʹah ordered that jeremiah be put in custody in the courtyard of the guard and he was given a round loaf of bread daily from the street of the bakers until all the bread in the city was gone
and jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard
45  this is the word that jeremiah the prophet spoke to barʹuch the son of neriʹah when he wrote in a book these words dictated by jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judah
2  this is what jehovah the god of israel says concerning you barʹuch
3  you have said woe to me for jehovah has added grief to my pain i am weary from my groaning and i have found no restingplace
4  you should say to him this is what jehovah says look what i have built up i am tearing down and what i have planted i am uprootingthe entire land
5  but you are seeking great things for yourself
stop seeking such things
for i am about to bring a calamity on all flesh declares jehovah and wherever you may go i will grant you your life as a spoil
52  zedekiʹah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was hamuʹtal the daughter of jeremiah of libʹnah
2  he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes according to all that jehoiʹakim had done
3  it was because of jehovahs anger that these things took place in jerusalem and in judah until he cast them out of his sight
and zedekiʹah rebelled against the king of babylon
4  in the ninth year of zedekiʹahs reign in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon came with all his army against jerusalem
they camped against it and built a siege wall all around it
5  and the city was under siege until the 11th year of king zedekiʹah
6  in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month the famine was severe in the city and there was no food for the people of the land
7  finally the city wall was broken through and all the soldiers fled from the city by night through the gate between the double wall near the kings garden while the chaldeʹans were surrounding the city and they continued by the way of the arʹabah
8  but the chaldeʹan army pursued the king and they overtook zedekiʹah in the desert plains of jerʹicho and all his troops were scattered from his side
9  then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of babylon at ribʹlah in the land of haʹmath and he passed sentence on him
10  and the king of babylon slaughtered zedekiʹahs sons before his eyes and he also slaughtered all the princes of judah there at ribʹlah
11  then the king of babylon blinded zedekiʹahs eyes bound him with copper fetters brought him to babylon and kept him imprisoned until the day of his death
12  in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month that is in the 19th year of king nebuchadnezʹzar the king of babylon nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard who was an attendant of the king of babylon came into jerusalem
13  he burned down the house of jehovah the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem he also burned down every large house
14  and the walls surrounding jerusalem were pulled down by the entire chaldeʹan army that was with the chief of the guard
15  nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard took into exile some of the lowly people and the rest of the people who were left in the city
he also took the deserters who had defected to the king of babylon as well as the rest of the master craftsmen
16  but nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to serve as vinedressers and as compulsory laborers
17  and the chaldeʹans broke into pieces the copper pillars of the house of jehovah and the carriages and the copper sea that were in the house of jehovah and they carried all the copper away to babylon
18  they also took the cans the shovels the extinguishers the bowls the cups and all the copper utensils used in the temple service
19  the chief of the guard took the basins the fire holders the bowls the cans the lampstands the cups and the bowls that were of genuine gold and silver
20  as for the two pillars the sea the 12 copper bulls under the sea and the carriages that king solʹomon had made for the house of jehovah the copper of all these articles was beyond weighing
21  as for the pillars each pillar was 18 cubits high a measuring cord of 12 cubits could encircle it its thickness was four fingerbreadths and it was hollow
22  and the capital on it was of copper and the height of the one capital was five cubits and the network and pomegranates all around on the capital were all made of copper
the second pillar was just like it also the pomegranates
23  there were 96 pomegranates on the sides in all there were 100 pomegranates around the network
24  the chief of the guard also took seraiʹah the chief priest zephaniʹah the second priest and the three doorkeepers
25  and he took from the city one court official who was the commissioner over the soldiers seven close associates of the king who were found in the city as well as the secretary of the chief of the army the one mustering the people of the land and 60 men of the common people of the land who were yet found in the city
26  nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard took them and brought them to the king of babylon at ribʹlah
27  the king of babylon struck them down and put them to death at ribʹlah in the land of haʹmath
thus judah went into exile from its land
28  these are the people whom nebuchadnezʹzar took into exile in the seventh year 3023 jews
29  in the 18th year of nebuchadnezʹzar 832 people were taken from jerusalem
30  in the 23rd year of nebuchadnezʹzar nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard took jews into exile 745 people
in all 4600 people were taken into exile
31  then in the 37th year of the exile of king jehoiʹachin of judah in the 12th month on the 25th day of the month king eʹvilmerʹodach of babylon in the year he became king released king jehoiʹachin of judah and brought him out of prison
32  he spoke kindly with him and put his throne higher than the thrones of the other kings who were with him in babylon
33  so jehoiʹachin took off his prison garments and he regularly ate before him all the days of his life
34  a regular allowance of food was given him from the king of babylon day after day until the day of his death all the days of his life
23  woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture declares jehovah
2  therefore this is what jehovah the god of israel says against the shepherds who are shepherding my people you have scattered my sheep you kept dispersing them and you have not turned your attention to them
so i will turn my attention to you because of your evil deeds declares jehovah
3  then i will gather together the remnant of my sheep from all the lands to which i have dispersed them and i will bring them back to their pasture and they will be fruitful and become many
4  and i will raise up over them shepherds who will really shepherd them
they will no longer be afraid or be terrified and none will be missing declares jehovah
5  look the days are coming declares jehovah when i will raise up to david a righteous sprout
and a king will reign and show insight and uphold justice and righteousness in the land
6  in his days judah will be saved and israel will reside in security
and this is the name by which he will be called jehovah is our righteousness
7  however the days are coming declares jehovah when they will no longer say as surely as jehovah is alive who brought the people of israel out of the land of egypt
8  but rather as surely as jehovah is alive who brought out and brought back the descendants of the house of israel from the land of the north and from all the lands to which i had dispersed them and they will dwell in their own land
9  concerning the prophets my heart is broken within me
all my bones are shaking
i am like a man who is drunkand like a man overcome by winebecause of jehovah and because of his holy words
10  for the land is full of adulterersbecause of the curse the land has gone into mourningand the pastures of the wilderness have dried up
their course is evil and they abuse their power
11  both the prophet and the priest are polluted
even in my own house i have found their wickedness declares jehovah
12  so their path will become slippery and darkthey will be pushed and will fall
for i will bring calamity on themin the year of reckoning declares jehovah
13  and in the prophets of samarʹia i have seen what is repulsive
their prophecies are incited by baʹaland they lead my people israel astray
14  and in the prophets of jerusalem i have seen horrible things
they commit adultery and walk in falsehoodthey encourage evildoersand they do not turn away from their wickedness
to me they are all like sodʹomand her inhabitants are like gomorʹrah
15  therefore this is what jehovah of armies says against the prophets here i am making them eat wormwoodand giving them poisoned water to drink
for from the prophets of jerusalem apostasy has spread throughout the land
16  this is what jehovah of armies says do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you
they are deluding you
the vision they speak is from their own heartnot from the mouth of jehovah
17  they are saying again and again to those who disrespect mejehovah has said you will enjoy peace
and to everyone who follows his own stubborn heart they sayno calamity will come upon you
18  for who has stood in the inner circle of jehovahto see and hear his word who has paid attention to his word in order to hear it
19  look the windstorm of jehovah will burst out in furylike a whirling tempest it will whirl down on the head of the wicked
20  the anger of jehovah will not turn backuntil he has carried out and accomplished the intentions of his heart
in the final part of the days you will clearly understand this
21  i did not send the prophets yet they ran
i did not speak to them yet they prophesied
22  but if they had stood in my inner circlethey would have made my people hear my wordsand would have caused them to turn back from their bad way and their evil deeds
23  am i only a god nearby declares jehovah and not a god also from far away
24  can any man hide in a concealed place where i cannot see him declares jehovah
do i not fill the heavens and the earth declares jehovah
25  i have heard the prophets who are prophesying lies in my name say i had a dream i had a dream
26  how long will this continue in the heart of the prophets to prophesy lies they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart
27  they intend to make my people forget my name by the dreams they relate to one another just as their fathers forgot my name because of baʹal
28  let the prophet who has a dream relate the dream but the one who has my word should speak my word truthfully
what does the straw have in common with the grain declares jehovah
29  is not my word just like a fire declares jehovah and like a forge hammer that smashes the crag
30  so here i am against the prophets declares jehovah who steal my words from one another
31  here i am against the prophets declares jehovah those who use their tongue to say he declares
32  here i am against the prophets of lying dreams declares jehovah who relate them and lead my people astray because of their lies and their boasting
but i did not send them or command them
so they will not benefit this people at all declares jehovah
33  and when this people or a prophet or a priest asks you what is the burden of jehovah you should reply to them you people are the burden and i will cast you off declares jehovah
34  as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say this is the burden of jehovah i will turn my attention on that man and on his household
35  this is what each of you is saying to his fellow and to his brother what has jehovah answered and what has jehovah spoken
36  but the burden of jehovah you should mention no more for the burden is each ones own word and you have changed the words of the living god jehovah of armies our god
37  this is what you will say to the prophet what answer has jehovah given you and what has jehovah spoken
38  and if you keep saying the burden of jehovah this is what jehovah says because of your saying this word is the burden of jehovah after i told you you must not say the burden of jehovah
39  look i will lift you up and throw you away from my presence both you and the city that i gave to you and your forefathers
40  and i will bring on you everlasting disgrace and everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten
42  then all the army chiefs and johaʹnan the son of kareʹah jezaniʹah the son of hoshaiʹah and all the people from the least to the greatest approached
2  and said to jeremiah the prophet hear please our request for favor and pray in our behalf to jehovah your god in behalf of all this remnant for just a few of many are left as you can see
3  may jehovah your god tell us the way we should walk and what we should do
4  jeremiah the prophet replied to them i have heard you and i am praying to jehovah your god according to your request and every word that jehovah answers you i will tell you
i will not hold back a word from you
5  they replied to jeremiah may jehovah be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not do exactly as jehovah your god instructs us through you
6  whether good or bad we will obey the voice of jehovah our god to whom we are sending you so that it may go well with us because we obey the voice of jehovah our god
7  now ten days later the word of jehovah came to jeremiah
8  so he called for johaʹnan the son of kareʹah and for all the army chiefs who were with him and for all the people from the least to the greatest
9  he said to them this is what jehovah the god of israel says to whom you sent me to present your request for favor before him
10  if you will indeed remain in this land then i will build you up and not tear you down and i will plant you and not uproot you for i will feel regret over the calamity i have caused you
11  do not be afraid because of the king of babylon whom you fear
do not be afraid because of him declares jehovah for i am with you to save you and to rescue you out of his hand
12  and i will show you mercy and he will have mercy on you and return you to your own land
13  but if you say no we will not remain in this land and you disobey the voice of jehovah your god
14  by saying no we will go instead to the land of egypt where we will not see war or hear the sound of the horn or hunger for bread there is where we will live
15  then hear the word of jehovah o remnant of judah
this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says if you are absolutely determined to go to egypt and you go there to reside
16  then the very sword you are afraid of will catch up with you there in the land of egypt and the very famine you fear will follow after you to egypt and there you will die
17  and all the men who are determined to go to egypt to reside there will die by the sword by famine and by pestilence
none of them will survive or escape the calamity that i will bring on them
18  for this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says just as my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of jerusalem so my wrath will be poured out on you if you go to egypt and you will become a curse an object of horror a malediction and a reproach and you will never again see this place
19  jehovah has spoken against you o remnant of judah
do not go to egypt
you should know for a certainty that i have warned you today
20  that your error will cost you your lives
for you sent me to jehovah your god saying pray in our behalf to jehovah our god and tell us everything that jehovah our god says and we will do it
21  and i told you today but you will not obey the voice of jehovah your god or do anything he sent me to tell you
22  therefore know for a certainty that by the sword by famine and by pestilence you will die in the place where you desire to go and reside
22  this is what jehovah says go down to the house of the king of judah and deliver this message
2  you must say hear the word of jehovah o king of judah who sits on the throne of david you with your servants and your people those who enter through these gates
3  this is what jehovah says uphold justice and righteousness
rescue the one being robbed from the hand of the defrauder
do not mistreat any foreign resident and do not harm any fatherless child or widow
and do not shed any innocent blood in this place
4  for if you are careful to carry out this word then the kings who sit on the throne of david will enter through the gates of this house riding in chariots and on horses they with their servants and their people
5  but if you will not obey these words by myself i do swear declares jehovah that this house will become a devastated place
6  for this is what jehovah says concerning the house of the king of judahyou are as gilʹead to melike the summit of lebʹanon
but i will make you a wildernessnot one of your cities will be inhabited
7  and i will appoint destroyers against youeach with his weapons
they will cut down your choicest cedarsand make them fall into the fire
8  and many nations will pass by this city and say to one another why did jehovah do this to this great city
9  and they will reply because they abandoned the covenant of jehovah their god and bowed down to other gods and served them
10  do not weep for the dead oneand do not sympathize with him
instead weep profusely for the one going awayfor he will return no more to see the land of his birth
11  for this is what jehovah says concerning shalʹlum son of josiʹah the king of judah who is reigning instead of his father josiʹah and who has gone out of this place he will return there no more
12  for he will die in the place where they have taken him into exile and he will see this land no more
13  woe to the one who builds his house without righteousnessand his upper rooms without justicewho makes his fellow man serve him for nothingwhose wages he refuses to pay
14  the one saying i will build for myself a roomy housewith spacious upper rooms
i will fit it with windowsand panel it with cedar and paint it with vermilion
15  will you continue reigning because you outdo others in your use of cedar your father also ate and drankbut he upheld justice and righteousnessand it went well with him
16  he defended the legal claim of the afflicted one and the poor oneso that it went well
is that not what it means to know me declares jehovah
17  but your eyes and heart are set only on your dishonest gainon shedding innocent bloodand on committing fraud and extortion
18  therefore this is what jehovah says concerning jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judahthey will not mourn him alas my brother alas my sister they will not mourn him alas o master alas his majesty
19  with the burial of a donkey he will be burieddragged about and thrown awayoutside the gates of jerusalem
20  go up to lebʹanon and cry outraise your voice in baʹshanand cry out from abʹarimfor all your passionate lovers have been crushed
21  i spoke to you when you felt secure
but you said i will not obey
this has been your course since youthfor you have not obeyed my voice
22  a wind will shepherd all your shepherdsand your passionate lovers will go into captivity
then you will be put to shame and humiliated because of all your calamity
23  o you who dwell in lebʹanonnestled among the cedarshow you will groan when pangs come on youanguish like that of a woman giving birth
24  as surely as i am alive declares jehovah even if coniʹah son of jehoiʹakim the king of judah were the seal ring on my right hand i would pull you off from there
25  i will give you into the hand of those seeking to take your life into the hand of those whom you fear into the hand of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeʹans
26  and i will hurl you and your mother who gave birth to you into another land where you were not born and there you will die
27  and they will never return to the land they yearn for
28  is this man coniʹah just a despised broken pota vessel that nobody wants why are he and his descendants hurled downand thrown into a land they do not know
29  o earth earth earth hear the word of jehovah
30  this is what jehovah says write down this man as childlessas a man who will not have any success during his lifetimefor none of his descendants will succeedin sitting on davids throne and ruling again in judah
38  now shephatiʹah the son of matʹtan gedaliʹah the son of pashʹhur juʹcal the son of shelemiʹah and pashʹhur the son of malchiʹjah heard the words that jeremiah was speaking to all the people saying
2  this is what jehovah says the one who remains in this city will die by the sword by famine and by pestilence
but the one who surrenders to the chaldeʹans will keep living and will have his life as a spoil and live
3  this is what jehovah says this city will surely be handed over to the army of the king of babylon and he will capture it
4  the princes said to the king please have this man put to death for this is how he is weakening the morale of the soldiers who are left in this city as well as that of all the people by speaking such words to them
for this man seeks not the peace of this people but their calamity
5  king zedekiʹah replied look he is in your hands for the king cannot do anything to stop you
6  so they took jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of malchiʹjah the son of the king which was in the courtyard of the guard
they let jeremiah down by ropes
now there was no water in the cistern only mud and jeremiah began to sink down into the mud
7  eʹbedmelʹech the ethioʹpian a eunuch in the kings house heard that they had put jeremiah into the cistern
now the king was sitting in the gate of benjamin
8  so eʹbedmelʹech went out of the kings house and spoke to the king saying
9  o my lord the king what these men have done to jeremiah the prophet is evil they have thrown him into the cistern and he will die there because of the famine for there is no bread left in the city
10  then the king commanded eʹbedmelʹech the ethioʹpian take 30 men with you from here and pull jeremiah the prophet up out of the cistern before he dies
11  so eʹbedmelʹech took the men with him and went into the kings house to a place beneath the treasury and they took from there some wornout rags and wornout pieces of cloth and let them down by ropes to jeremiah in the cistern
12  then eʹbedmelʹech the ethioʹpian said to jeremiah please put the rags and the pieces of cloth between your armpits and the ropes
jeremiah did so
13  and they drew jeremiah out with the ropes and pulled him up out of the cistern
and jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard
14  king zedekiʹah sent for jeremiah the prophet to come to him at the third entrance which is in the house of jehovah and the king said to jeremiah i have something to ask of you
do not hide anything from me
15  jeremiah then said to zedekiʹah if i tell you you will certainly put me to death
and if i give you advice you will not listen to me
16  so king zedekiʹah secretly swore to jeremiah saying as surely as jehovah is alive who has given us this life i will not put you to death and i will not hand you over to these men who are seeking to take your life
17  jeremiah then said to zedekiʹah this is what jehovah the god of armies the god of israel says if you surrender to the princes of the king of babylon your life will be spared and this city will not be burned with fire and you and your household will be spared
18  but if you will not surrender to the princes of the king of babylon this city will be handed over to the chaldeʹans and they will burn it with fire and you will not escape out of their hand
19  then king zedekiʹah said to jeremiah i am afraid of the jews who have deserted to the chaldeʹans for if i am handed over to them they may deal cruelly with me
20  but jeremiah said you will not be handed over to them
obey please the voice of jehovah in what i am telling you and it will go well with you and you will continue to live
21  but if you refuse to surrender this is what jehovah has revealed to me
22  look all the women remaining in the house of the king of judah are being brought out to the princes of the king of babylon and they are sayingthe men whom you trusted have deceived you and overcome you
they have caused your foot to sink into the mud
now they have turned away in retreat
23  and all your wives and your sons they are bringing out to the chaldeʹans and you will not escape out of their hand but you will be seized by the king of babylon and because of you this city will be burned with fire
24  zedekiʹah then said to jeremiah do not let anyone know about these things so that you do not die
25  and if the princes hear that i have spoken with you and they come and say to you tell us please what you said to the king
do not hide anything from us and we will not put you to death
what did the king say to you
26  you must answer them i was making a request of the king that he not send me back to the house of jehonʹathan to die there
27  in time all the princes came in to jeremiah and questioned him
he told them everything that the king had commanded him to say
so they said no more to him for no one had heard the conversation
28  until the day that jerusalem was captured jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard he was still there when jerusalem was captured
32  the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah in the 10th year of king zedekiʹah of judah that is the 18th year of nebuchadnezʹzar
2  at that time the armies of the king of babylon were besieging jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the house of the king of judah
3  for king zedekiʹah of judah had confined him saying why do you prophesy like this you say this is what jehovah says i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he will capture it
4  and king zedekiʹah of judah will not escape from the chaldeʹans for he will surely be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he will speak to him facetoface and see him eye to eye
5  he will take zedekiʹah to babylon and there he will remain until i turn my attention to him declares jehovah
although you keep fighting against the chaldeʹans you will not succeed
6  jeremiah said the word of jehovah has come to me saying
7  here hanʹamel the son of shalʹlum your uncle will come to you and say buy for yourself my field in anʹathoth because you have the first right to repurchase it
8  hanʹamel the son of my uncle came to me just as jehovah had said into the courtyard of the guard and he said to me please buy my field in anʹathoth in the land of benjamin for you have the right to take possession of it and to repurchase it
buy it for yourself
at that i knew that this was by the word of jehovah
9  so i bought the field in anʹathoth from hanʹamel the son of my uncle
i weighed out the money to him seven shekels and ten silver pieces
10  then i recorded it in a deed affixed the seal called in witnesses and weighed the money in the scales
11  i took the deed of purchase the one that was sealed according to the commandment and legal requirements as well as the one that was left unsealed
12  and i gave the deed of purchase to barʹuch son of neriʹah son of mahseiʹah in the presence of hanʹamel the son of my uncle the witnesses who wrote in the deed of purchase and all the jews who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard
13  i now commanded barʹuch in their presence saying
14  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says take these deeds this deed of purchase the sealed one and the other deed left unsealed and put them into an earthenware vessel so that they may be kept for a long time
15  for this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land
16  then i prayed to jehovah after giving the deed of purchase to barʹuch the son of neriʹah saying
17  alas o sovereign lord jehovah look you made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm
nothing is too wonderful for you
18  the one showing loyal love to thousands but repaying the error of the fathers to their sons after them the true god the great and mighty one whose name is jehovah of armies
19  you are great in counsel and mighty in deed you whose eyes observe all the ways of men to give to each one according to his ways and according to what he does
20  you have performed signs and miracles in the land of egypt which are known down to this day and thus you have made a name for yourself in israel and among mankind as it is today
21  and you brought your people israel out of the land of egypt with signs with miracles with a mighty hand with an outstretched arm and with terrifying deeds
22  in time you gave them this land that you swore to give to their forefathers a land flowing with milk and honey
23  and they came in and took possession of it but they did not obey your voice or walk in your law
they did not do anything you commanded them to do so that you caused all this calamity to befall them
24  look men have come with siege ramparts to capture the city and because of the sword the famine and the pestilence the city will certainly fall into the hands of the chaldeʹans who are fighting against it what you said has all happened as you now see
25  but you have told me o sovereign lord jehovah buy for yourself the field with money and call in witnesses although the city will certainly be given into the hand of the chaldeʹans
26  at that the word of jehovah came to jeremiah saying
27  here i am jehovah the god of all mankind
is there anything too wonderful for me
28  so this is what jehovah says here i am handing this city over to the chaldeʹans and into the hand of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and he will capture it
29  and the chaldeʹans fighting against this city will come in and set this city on fire and burn it down along with the houses on whose roofs the people offered sacrifices to baʹal and poured out drink offerings to other gods to offend me
30  for the people of israel and of judah have done only what was bad in my eyes from their youth on the people of israel keep offending me by the work of their hands declares jehovah
31  for this city from the day that they built it down to this day has been nothing but a cause of anger and wrath to me so that it must be removed from before my face
32  because of all the evil that the people of israel and of judah have done to offend methey their kings their princes their priests their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem
33  they kept turning their backs to me not their faces although i tried to teach them again and again none of them would listen to receive discipline
34  and they put their disgusting idols in the house that bears my name in order to defile it
35  furthermore they built the high places of baʹal in the valley of the son of hinʹnom in order to make their sons and their daughters pass through the fire to moʹlech something that i had not commanded them and that had never come into my heart to do such a detestable thing causing judah to sin
36  therefore this is what jehovah the god of israel says concerning this city that you are saying will be given into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword the famine and the pestilence
37  here i will gather them together from all the lands where i dispersed them in my anger and in my wrath and in great indignation and i will bring them back to this place and let them dwell in security
38  and they will be my people and i will be their god
39  and i will give them one heart and one way so that they may always fear me for their own good and the good of their children after them
40  and i will make with them an everlasting covenant that i will not turn away from doing good to them and i will put the fear of me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from me
41  i will exult over them to do good to them and i will firmly plant them in this land with all my heart and with all my soul
42  for this is what jehovah says just as i have brought on this people all this great calamity so i will bring on them all the goodness that i am promising them
43  and fields will again be bought in this land though you are saying it is a wasteland without man and beast and it has been handed over to the chaldeʹans
44  fields will be bought with money deeds of purchase will be recorded and sealed and witnesses will be called in the land of benjamin in the areas around jerusalem in the cities of judah in the cities of the mountainous region in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the south because i will bring back their captives declares jehovah
6  take shelter o sons of benjamin away from jerusalem
blow the horn in tekoʹalight a fire signal over bethhaccheʹrem for a calamity looms from the north a great disaster
2  the daughter of zion resembles a beautiful and delicate woman
3  the shepherds and their droves will come
they will pitch their tents all around hereach grazing the flock in his care
4  prepare for war against her rise up and let us attack her at midday woe to us for the day is decliningfor the shadows of evening are getting longer
5  rise up and let us attack during the nightand destroy her fortified towers
6  for this is what jehovah of armies says cut down wood and raise up a siege rampart against jerusalem
she is the city that must be held to accountthere is nothing but oppression within her
7  as a cistern keeps its water coolso she keeps her wickedness cool
violence and destruction are heard in hersickness and plague are constantly before me
8  be warned o jerusalem or i will turn away from you in disgusti will make you desolate a land without inhabitants
9  this is what jehovah of armies says they will thoroughly glean the remnant of israel as the last grapes on a vine
pass your hand again like one gathering grapes from the vines
10  to whom should i speak and give warning who will listen look their ears are closed so that they are unable to pay attention
look the word of jehovah has become something they scornthey find no pleasure in it
11  so i am filled with the wrath of jehovahand i am tired of holding it in
pour it out on the child in the streeton the groups of young men gathered together
they will all be captured a man along with his wifethe old men along with the very old
12  their houses will be turned over to otherstogether with their fields and their wives
for i will stretch my hand out against the inhabitants of the land declares jehovah
13  for from the least to the greatest each one is making dishonest gainfrom the prophet to the priest each one is practicing fraud
14  and they try to heal the breakdown of my people lightly sayingthere is peace there is peace when there is no peace
15  do they feel ashamed of the detestable things they have done they feel no shame at all they do not even know how to feel humiliated so they will fall among the fallen
when i bring punishment on them they will stumble says jehovah
16  this is what jehovah says stand at the crossroads and see
ask about the ancient roadwaysask where the good way is and walk in itand find rest for yourselves
but they say we will not walk in it
17  and i appointed watchmen who saidpay attention to the sound of the horn but they said we will not pay attention
18  therefore hear o nations and know o assemblywhat will happen to them
19  listen o earth i am bringing calamity on this peopleas the fruitage of their own schemesfor they paid no attention to my wordsand they rejected my law
20  what do i care that you bring frankincense from sheʹbaand sweet cane from a distant land your whole burnt offerings are not acceptableand your sacrifices do not please me
21  therefore this is what jehovah says here i am setting for this people stumbling blocksand they will stumble over themfathers and sons togethera neighbor and his companionand they will all perish
22  this is what jehovah says look a people is coming from the land of the northand a great nation will be awakened from the remotest parts of the earth
23  they will grab hold of the bow and the javelin
they are cruel and will have no mercy
their voice will roar like the seaand they ride on horses
they draw up in battle order like a man of war against you o daughter of zion
24  we have heard the report about it
our hands fall limpdistress has seized usanguish like that of a woman giving birth
25  do not go out into the fieldand do not walk on the roadfor the enemy has a swordthere is terror all around
26  o daughter of my peopleput on sackcloth and roll in the ashes
mourn as for an only son with bitter wailingfor suddenly the destroyer will come upon us
27  i have made you a metal tester among my peopleone making a thorough searchyou must take note and examine their way
28  all of them are the most stubborn menwalking about as slanderers
they are like copper and ironall of them are corrupt
29  the bellows have been scorched
out from their fire there is lead
one keeps refining intensely simply for nothingand those who are bad have not been separated
30  rejected silver is what people will certainly call themfor jehovah has rejected them
31  at that time declares jehovah i will become god to all the families of israel and they will become my people
2  this is what jehovah says the people who survived the sword found favor in the wildernesswhen israel was walking to his restingplace
3  from far away jehovah appeared to me and said i have loved you with an everlasting love
that is why i have drawn you to me with loyal love
4  yet again i will rebuild you and you will be rebuilt
o virgin of israel you will again take up your tambourinesand go forth dancing joyfully
5  you will again plant vineyards in the mountains of samarʹiathe planters will plant and enjoy their fruit
6  for the day will come when the watchmen in the mountains of eʹphraim will call out rise up let us go up to zion to jehovah our god
7  for this is what jehovah says cry out to jacob with rejoicing
shout for joy because you are over the nations
proclaim it offer praise and sayo jehovah save your people the remnant of israel
8  i am bringing them back from the land of the north
i will gather them together from the remotest parts of the earth
among them will be the blind and the lamethe pregnant woman and the one giving birth all together
as a great congregation they will return here
9  they will come weeping
i will lead them as they beg for favor
i will guide them to streams of wateron a level path that will not make them stumble
for i am a father to israel and eʹphraim is my firstborn
10  hear the word of jehovah you nationsand proclaim it among the islands far away the one who scattered israel will gather him together
he will watch over him as a shepherd does his flock
11  for jehovah will redeem jacoband rescue him out of the hand of the one stronger than he is
12  they will come and shout joyfully on the height of zionand become radiant over the goodness of jehovahover the grain and the new wine and the oiland over the young of the flock and the herd
they will become like a wellwatered gardenand they will never languish again
13  at that time the virgin will dance joyfullyalso the young men and the old men together
i will change their mourning into exultation
i will comfort them and give them joy instead of their grief
14  i will satisfy the priests with plentyand my people will be satisfied with my goodness declares jehovah
15  this is what jehovah says a voice is heard in raʹmah lamentation and bitter weeping rachel is weeping over her sons
she has refused to be comforted over her sonsbecause they are no more
16  this is what jehovah says hold back your voice from weeping and your eyes from tearsfor there is a reward for your activity declares jehovah
they will return from the land of the enemy
17  and there is a hope for your future declares jehovah
your sons will return to their own territory
18  i have surely heard eʹphraims moaningyou have corrected me and i have been correctedlike a calf that has not been trained
bring me back and i will readily turn backfor you are jehovah my god
19  for after my turning back i felt remorseafter i was made to understand i struck my thigh in grief
i was ashamed and humiliatedfor i bore the reproach of my youth
20  is eʹphraim not a precious son to me a beloved child for as often as i speak against him i do remember him still
that is why my emotions are stirred for him
and i will surely have pity on him declares jehovah
21  set up road markers for yourselfand put up signposts
pay attention to the highway the way that you have to go
return o virgin of israel return to these cities of yours
22  how long will you waver o unfaithful daughter for jehovah has created something new in the earth a woman will eagerly pursue a man
23  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says they will again say these words in the land of judah and in its cities when i gather back their captives may jehovah bless you o righteous dwelling place o holy mountain
24  and in it judah and all its cities will dwell all together farmers and those who lead the flocks
25  for i will satisfy the weary one and fill each one who is languishing
26  at this i awoke and opened my eyes and my sleep had been pleasurable to me
27  look the days are coming declares jehovah when i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with the seed of livestock
28  and just as i watched over them to uproot to pull down to tear down to destroy and to do harm so i will watch over them to build up and to plant declares jehovah
29  in those days they will no longer say the fathers ate sour grapes but the teeth of the sons were set on edge
30  but then each one will die for his own error
any man eating sour grapes will have his own teeth set on edge
31  look the days are coming declares jehovah when i will make with the house of israel and with the house of judah a new covenant
32  it will not be like the covenant that i made with their forefathers on the day i took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of egypt my covenant that they broke although i was their true master declares jehovah
33  for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days declares jehovah
i will put my law within them and in their heart i will write it
and i will become their god and they will become my people
34  and they will no longer teach each one his neighbor and each one his brother saying know jehovah for they will all know me from the least to the greatest of them declares jehovah
for i will forgive their error and i will no longer remember their sin
35  this is what jehovah sayswho gives the sun for light by daythe laws of the moon and the stars for light by nightwho stirs up the sea and makes its waves boisterouswhose name is jehovah of armies
36  if these regulations should ever fail declares jehovahonly then would the offspring of israel cease as a nation before me always
37  this is what jehovah says if the heavens above could be measured and the foundations of the earth below could be explored only then could i reject all the offspring of israel for all they have done declares jehovah
38  look the days are coming declares jehovah when the city will be built to jehovah from the tower of hananʹel to the corner gate
39  and the measuring line will go out straight ahead to the hill of gaʹreb and it will turn toward goʹah
40  and all the valley of the carcasses and of ashes and all the terraces as far as the kidʹron valley clear to the corner of the horse gate toward the east will be something holy to jehovah
it will never again be uprooted or torn down
21  jeremiah received the word from jehovah when king zedekiʹah sent to him pashʹhur son of malchiʹjah and zephaniʹah son of maaseiʹah the priest requesting
2  please inquire of jehovah in our behalf because king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon is waging war against us
perhaps jehovah will perform one of his wonderful works in our behalf so that he will withdraw from us
3  jeremiah said to them this is what you should say to zedekiʹah
4  this is what jehovah the god of israel says here i am turning around against you the weapons of war that are in your own hands with which you are fighting the king of babylon and the chaldeʹans who are outside the wall besieging you
and i will gather them into the middle of this city
5  and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm with anger and wrath and great indignation
6  i will strike the inhabitants of this city both man and beast
by a great pestilence they will die
7  and after that declares jehovah i will give king zedekiʹah of judah and his servants and the people of this citythose who survive the pestilence the sword and the famineinto the hand of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who are seeking to take their life
he will strike them down with the sword
he will not feel sorry for them nor will he show compassion or have any mercy
8  and to this people you should say this is what jehovah says here i am putting before you the way of life and the way of death
9  those who remain in this city will die by the sword by famine and by pestilence
but whoever goes out and surrenders to the chaldeʹans who are besieging you will keep living and he will have his life as a spoil
10  for i have set my face against this city for calamity and not for good declares jehovah
it will be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he will burn it with fire
11  to the household of the king of judah hear the word of jehovah
12  o house of david this is what jehovah says uphold justice every morningand rescue the one being robbed from the hand of the defrauderso that my wrath does not blaze like a fireand burn with no one to extinguish itbecause of your evil deeds
13  here i am against you o inhabitant of the valleyo rock of the level land declares jehovah
as for you who say who will come down against us and who will invade our dwellings
14  i will hold an accounting against youas your deeds deserve declares jehovah
and i will set her forest ablazeand it will consume all the things around her
25  the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judah which was the first year of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon
2  this is what jeremiah the prophet spoke concerning all the people of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem
3  from the 13th year of josiʹah son of aʹmon the king of judah to this day these 23 years the word of jehovah has come to me and i kept speaking to you again and again but you would not listen
4  and jehovah sent all his servants the prophets to you sending them again and again but you would not listen or incline your ear to hear
5  they would say turn back please each of you from your evil ways and your evil deeds then you will continue dwelling for a long time to come in the land that jehovah long ago gave to you and to your forefathers
6  do not follow other gods and serve them and bow down to them offending me with the work of your hands otherwise i will bring calamity on you
7  but you would not listen to me declares jehovah
instead you offended me with the work of your hands to your own calamity
8  therefore this is what jehovah of armies says because you would not obey my words
9  i am sending for all the families of the north declares jehovah sending for king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon my servant and i will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these surrounding nations
i will devote them to destruction and make them an object of horror and something to whistle at and a perpetual ruin
10  i will put an end to the sound of exultation and the sound of rejoicing from them the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the hand mill and the light of the lamp
11  and all this land will be reduced to ruins and will become an object of horror and these nations will have to serve the king of babylon for 70 years
12  but when 70 years have been fulfilled i will call to account the king of babylon and that nation for their error declares jehovah and i will make the land of the chaldeʹans a desolate wasteland for all time
13  i will bring on that land all my words that i have spoken against it all that is written in this book that jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations
14  for many nations and great kings will make slaves of them and i will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their own hands
15  for this is what jehovah the god of israel said to me take this cup of the wine of wrath out of my hand and make all the nations to whom i send you drink it
16  and they will drink and stagger and act like madmen because of the sword that i am sending among them
17  so i took the cup out of the hand of jehovah and made all the nations to whom jehovah sent me drink
18  starting with jerusalem and the cities of judah her kings and her princes to make them a ruin an object of horror something to whistle at and a curse as it is today
19  then pharʹaoh king of egypt and his servants his princes and all his people
20  and all their mixed populations all the kings of the land of uz all the kings of the land of the philisʹtines ashʹkelon gazʹa ekʹron and those remaining of ashʹdod
21  eʹdom moʹab and the amʹmonites
22  all the kings of tyre all the kings of siʹdon and the kings of the island in the sea
23  deʹdan teʹma buz and all those with hair clipped at the temples
24  all the kings of the arabians and all the kings of the mixed populations who reside in the wilderness
25  all the kings of zimʹri all the kings of eʹlam and all the kings of the medes
26  and all the kings of the north near and far one after the other and all the other kingdoms of the earth that are on the surface of the ground and the king of sheʹshach will drink after them
27  and you must say to them this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says drink and get drunk and vomit and fall so that you cannot get up because of the sword that i am sending among you
28  and if they refuse to take the cup out of your hand to drink say to them this is what jehovah of armies says you must drink it
29  for look if i am bringing calamity first on the city that bears my name should you go unpunished you will not go unpunished for i am calling for a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth declares jehovah of armies
30  and you are to prophesy all these words to them and say to themfrom on high jehovah will roarand from his holy dwelling he will make his voice heard
he will roar loudly against his abiding place
shouting like those treading the winepresshe will sing triumphantly against all the inhabitants of the earth
31  a noise will resound to the ends of the earthfor jehovah has a controversy with the nations
he will personally pass judgment on all humans
and he will put the wicked to the sword declares jehovah
32  this is what jehovah of armies says look a calamity is spreading from nation to nationand a great tempest will be unleashed from the remotest parts of the earth
33  and those slain by jehovah in that day will be from one end of the earth clear to the other end of the earth
they will not be mourned nor will they be gathered up or buried
they will become like manure on the surface of the ground
34  wail you shepherds and cry out wallow about you majestic ones of the flockbecause the time of your slaughter and your dispersion has comeand you will fall like a precious vessel
35  the shepherds have no place to fleeand there is no escape for the majestic ones of the flock
36  listen the outcry of the shepherdsand the wailing of the majestic ones of the flockfor jehovah is devastating their pasture
37  and the peaceful dwelling places have been made lifelessbecause of the burning anger of jehovah
38  he has left his lair just like a young lionfor their land has become an object of horrorbecause of the cruel swordand because of his burning anger
13  this is what jehovah told me go and buy a linen belt for yourself and put it around your waist but do not dip it in water
2  so i bought the belt according to the word of jehovah and put it around my waist
3  and the word of jehovah came to me a second time
4  take the belt that you bought and are wearing and get up go to the euphraʹtes and hide it there in a cleft of the crag
5  so i went and hid it by the euphraʹtes just as jehovah had commanded me
6  but many days later jehovah said to me get up go to the euphraʹtes and take from there the belt that i commanded you to hide there
7  so i went to the euphraʹtes and dug up the belt and took it from the place where i had hidden it and i saw that the belt had been ruined it was completely useless
8  then the word of jehovah came to me
9  this is what jehovah says in the same way i will destroy the pride of judah and the immense pride of jerusalem
10  these evil people who refuse to obey my words who stubbornly follow their own heart and who are following other gods serving and bowing down to them will become just like this belt that is completely useless
11  for just as a belt clings to the waist of a man so i made the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah cling to me declares jehovah to become to me a people a name a praise and something beautiful
but they did not obey
12  and you must also give this message to them this is what jehovah the god of israel says every large jar should be filled with wine
and they will reply to you do we not already know that every large jar should be filled with wine
13  then say to them this is what jehovah says here i am filling with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land the kings sitting on the throne of david the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem
14  and i will smash them against each other fathers and sons alike declares jehovah
i will not show compassion or feel any sorrow or have any mercy on them nothing will stop me from bringing them to ruin
15  hear and pay attention
do not be haughty for jehovah has spoken
16  give glory to jehovah your godbefore he brings darknessand before your feet stumble on the mountains at dusk
you will hope for the lightbut he will bring deep shadowhe will turn it into thick gloom
17  and if you refuse to listeni will weep in secret because of your pride
i will shed many tears and my eyes will stream with tearsbecause the flock of jehovah has been carried away captive
18  tell the king and the queen mother sit in a lower placefor your beautiful crown will fall from your head
19  the cities of the south are shut with no one to open them
all of judah has been taken into exile taken completely into exile
20  raise your eyes and see those coming from the north
where is the flock you were given your beautiful sheep
21  what will you say when your punishment comesfrom your close friends whom you cultivated from the start will not birth pains seize you like those of a woman giving birth
22  and when you say in your heart why have these things befallen me it is because of your great error that your skirts have been stripped off and your heels have been treated violently
23  can a cushʹite change his skin or a leopard its spots if so then you can do goodyou who are trained to do bad
24  so i will scatter them like straw blown by the desert wind
25  this is your lot the portion that i have measured out to you declares jehovahbecause you have forgotten me and you trust in lies
26  therefore i will lift up your skirts over your faceand your shame will be seen
27  your acts of adultery and your lustful neighingyour obscene prostitution
on the hills in the fieldi have seen your disgusting behavior
woe to you o jerusalem how much longer will you remain unclean
14  this is the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah concerning the droughts
2  judah mourns and its gates have faded away
they sink to the ground dejectedand a cry goes up from jerusalem
3  and their masters send their servants for water
they go to the water holes and find no water
they return with their vessels empty
they are ashamed and disappointedand they cover their heads
4  because the ground is crackedfor there is no rain on the landthe farmers are dismayed and cover their heads
5  even the doe in the field forsakes her newbornbecause there is no grass
6  the wild donkeys stand on the bare hills
they pant for air like jackalstheir eyes fail because there is no vegetation
7  although our own errors testify against uso jehovah act for the sake of your name
for our acts of unfaithfulness are manyand it is against you that we have sinned
8  o hope of israel his savior in times of distresswhy are you like a stranger in the landlike a traveler who stops only to spend the night
9  why are you like a man who is stunnedlike a mighty man who cannot save for you are among us o jehovahand your name has been called on us
do not abandon us
10  this is what jehovah says concerning this people they love to wander about they have not restrained their feet
so jehovah finds no pleasure in them
now he will remember their error and call them to account for their sins
11  then jehovah said to me do not pray for good to come to this people
12  when they fast i do not listen to their entreaties and when they offer whole burnt offerings and grain offerings i take no pleasure in them for by the sword by famine and by pestilence i will do away with them
13  at this i said alas o sovereign lord jehovah here the prophets are saying to them you will not see the sword and famine will not come upon you but i will give you true peace in this place
14  jehovah then said to me the prophets are prophesying lies in my name
i have not sent them or commanded them or spoken to them
a lying vision and a worthless divination and the deceit of their own heart is what they are prophesying to you
15  therefore this is what jehovah says concerning the prophets who are prophesying in my name though i did not send them and who say that no sword or famine will occur in this land by sword and by famine those prophets will perish
16  and the people to whom they are prophesying will be cast out into the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword with no one to bury themthem their wives their sons or their daughtersfor i will pour out on them the calamity they deserve
17  you must speak this word to themlet my eyes stream with tears night and day let them not ceasefor the virgin daughter of my people has been completely crushed and brokenwith an extremely severe wound
18  if i go out into the field and looki see those slain by the sword and if i come into the cityi see the diseases from the famine for both the prophet and the priest have gone around in a land that they do not know
19  have you completely rejected judah or have you abhorred zion why have you struck us so that there is no healing for us there was a hope for peace but nothing good camefor a time of healing but there is terror
20  we acknowledge our wickedness o jehovahand the error of our forefathersfor we have sinned against you
21  for the sake of your name do not reject usdo not despise your glorious throne
remember and do not break your covenant with us
22  can any of the worthless idols of the nations give rainor can even the heavens send showers of rain on their own are you not the only one o jehovah our god and we hope in youfor you alone have done all these things
29  these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem to the rest of the elders among the exiled people the priests the prophets and all the people whom nebuchadnezʹzar had taken into exile from jerusalem to babylon
2  after king jeconiʹah the queen mother the court officials the princes of judah and jerusalem and the craftsmen and the metalworkers had gone out of jerusalem
3  he sent the letter by the hand of elaʹsah the son of shaʹphan and gemariʹah the son of hilkiʹah whom king zedekiʹah of judah sent to babylon to king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon
it said
4  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says to all the exiled people whom i have caused to go into exile from jerusalem to babylon
5  build houses and live in them
plant gardens and eat their fruit
6  take wives and have sons and daughters take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage so that they too may have sons and daughters
become many there and do not decrease
7  and seek the peace of the city to which i have exiled you and pray in its behalf to jehovah for in its peace you will have peace
8  for this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you and do not listen to the dreams that they are dreaming
9  for they are prophesying lies to you in my name
i have not sent them declares jehovah
10  for this is what jehovah says when 70 years at babylon are fulfilled i will turn my attention to you and i will make good my promise by bringing you back to this place
11  for i well know the thoughts that i am thinking toward you declares jehovah thoughts of peace and not of calamity to give you a future and a hope
12  and you will call me and come and pray to me and i will listen to you
13  you will seek me and find me for you will search for me with all your heart
14  and i will let you find me declares jehovah
and i will gather your captives and collect you together out of all the nations and places to which i have dispersed you declares jehovah
and i will bring you back to the place from which i caused you to go into exile
15  but you have said jehovah has raised up prophets for us in babylon
16  for this is what jehovah says to the king sitting on the throne of david and to all the people dwelling in this city your brothers who have not gone with you into exile
17  this is what jehovah of armies says here i am sending against them the sword the famine and the pestilence and i will make them like rotten figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten
18  and i will pursue them with the sword with famine and with pestilence and i will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth and a curse and an object of astonishment something to whistle at and a reproach among all the nations to which i disperse them
19  because they have not listened to my words that i sent to them with my servants the prophets declares jehovah sending them again and again
but you have not listened declares jehovah
20  therefore hear the word of jehovah all you exiled people whom i have sent away from jerusalem to babylon
21  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says concerning aʹhab the son of kolaiʹah and concerning zedekiʹah the son of maaseiʹah who are prophesying lies to you in my name here i am giving them into the hand of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and he will strike them down before your eyes
22  and what happens to them will become a curse spoken by all the exiles of judah in babylon may jehovah make you like zedekiʹah and like aʹhab whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire
23  for they have acted disgracefully in israel committing adultery with the wives of their neighbors and speaking false words in my name that i did not command them
i am the one who knows and i am a witness declares jehovah
24  and to shemaiʹah of nehelʹam you will say
25  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says because you sent in your name letters to all the people who are in jerusalem to zephaniʹah son of maaseiʹah the priest and to all the priests saying
26  jehovah has made you priest instead of jehoiʹada the priest to become the overseer of the house of jehovah to be in charge of any madman who acts like a prophet and to put him into the stocks and into the pillory
27  why then have you not rebuked jeremiah of anʹathoth who is acting as a prophet for you
28  for he even sent to us at babylon saying it will be a long time build houses and live in them
plant gardens and eat their fruit
29  when zephaniʹah the priest read this letter in the hearing of jeremiah the prophet
30  the word of jehovah came to jeremiah saying
31  send to all the exiled people saying this is what jehovah says concerning shemaiʹah of nehelʹam because shemaiʹah prophesied to you though i did not send him and he tried to make you trust in lies
32  therefore this is what jehovah says here i am turning my attention to shemaiʹah of nehelʹam and his descendants
not one man of his will survive among this people and he will not see the good that i will do for my people declares jehovah for he has urged rebellion against jehovah
40  the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah after nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard let him go free from raʹmah
he had taken him there bound with handcuffs and he was among all the exiles of jerusalem and of judah who were being deported to babylon
2  then the chief of the guard took jeremiah and said to him jehovah your god foretold this calamity against this place
3  and jehovah has brought it about just as he said because you people sinned against jehovah and did not obey his voice
that is why this has happened to you
4  now i am releasing you today from the handcuffs that were on your hands
if it seems good to you to come with me to babylon come and i will look after you
but if you do not want to come with me to babylon do not come
see the entire land is before you
go wherever you choose
5  while jeremiah still had not turned back nebuʹzaradʹan said return to gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan whom the king of babylon has appointed over the cities of judah and stay with him among the people or go wherever you choose
the chief of the guard then gave him a food allowance and a gift and let him go
6  so jeremiah went to gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam at mizʹpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land
7  in time all the army chiefs who were in the field with their men heard that the king of babylon had appointed gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam over the land and that he had appointed him over the men women and children from the poor people of the land who had not been deported to babylon
8  so they came to gedaliʹah at mizʹpah
they were ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah johaʹnan and jonʹathan the sons of kareʹah seraiʹah the son of tanhuʹmeth the sons of eʹphai the netophʹathite and jezaniʹah the son of the maacʹathite together with their men
9  gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan swore an oath to them and to their men saying do not be afraid of serving the chaldeʹans
live in the land and serve the king of babylon and it will go well with you
10  as for me i will stay in mizʹpah to represent you to the chaldeʹans who come to us
but you should gather wine summer fruits and oil and put them in your storage containers and settle in the cities that you have taken over
11  and all the jews who were in moʹab amʹmon and eʹdom as well as those who were in all the other lands also heard that the king of babylon had let a remnant stay in judah and that he had appointed over them gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan
12  so all the jews began returning from all the places to which they had been dispersed and they came into the land of judah to gedaliʹah at mizʹpah
and they gathered wine and summer fruits in very great quantity
13  johaʹnan the son of kareʹah and all the army chiefs who were in the field came to gedaliʹah at mizʹpah
14  they said to him do you not know that baʹalis the king of the amʹmonites has sent ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah to kill you but gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam did not believe them
15  then johaʹnan the son of kareʹah secretly told gedaliʹah in mizʹpah i want to go and strike down ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah and no one will know
why should he kill you and why should all the people of judah who have gathered to you be scattered and the remnant of judah perish
16  but gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam said to johaʹnan the son of kareʹah do not do this for what you are saying concerning ishʹmael is a lie
39  in the ninth year of king zedekiʹah of judah in the tenth month king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon and all his army came to jerusalem and they besieged it
2  in the 11th year of zedekiʹah in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month they broke through the city wall
3  and all the princes of the king of babylon went in and sat down in the middle gate namely nerʹgalshareʹzer the samʹgar neʹbosarʹsechim the rabʹsaris nerʹgalshareʹzer the rabʹmag and all the rest of the princes of the king of babylon
4  when king zedekiʹah of judah and all the soldiers saw them they fled going out of the city by night by way of the kings garden through the gate between the double wall and they continued by the way of the arʹabah
5  but the chaldeʹan army chased after them and they overtook zedekiʹah in the desert plains of jerʹicho
they captured him and brought him up to king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon at ribʹlah in the land of haʹmath where he passed sentence on him
6  the king of babylon had the sons of zedekiʹah slaughtered before his eyes there at ribʹlah and the king of babylon had all the nobles of judah slaughtered
7  then he blinded the eyes of zedekiʹah after which he bound him with copper fetters to bring him to babylon
8  the chaldeʹans then burned down the kings house and the houses of the people and they tore down the walls of jerusalem
9  nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard took into exile to babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city the deserters who had defected to him and anyone who remained
10  but nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard left in the land of judah some of the poorest people those who had nothing at all
on that day he also gave them vineyards and fields to work
11  now king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon gave nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard these orders concerning jeremiah
12  take him and look after him do him no harm and grant whatever he asks of you
13  so nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard nebushazʹban the rabʹsaris nerʹgalshareʹzer the rabʹmag and all the principal men of the king of babylon sent
14  and had jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard and handed him over to gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan to be brought to his house
so he lived among the people
15  while jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guard the word of jehovah came to him saying
16  go and tell eʹbedmelʹech the ethioʹpian this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says here i am fulfilling my words on this city for calamity and not for good and in that day you will see it happen
17  but i will rescue you in that day declares jehovah and you will not be handed over to the men you fear
18  for i will surely provide you with escape and you will not fall by the sword
you will have your life as a spoil because you trusted in me declares jehovah
19  this is what jehovah said go and buy an earthenware flask from a potter
take some of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests
2  and go out to the valley of the son of hinʹnom at the entrance of the gate of the potsherds
and there proclaim the words that i speak to you
3  you will say hear the word of jehovah you kings of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem
this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says i am about to bring a calamity on this place and the ears of anyone who hears about it will tingle
4  it is because they abandoned me and made this place unrecognizable
in it they are sacrificing to other gods whom they and their forefathers and the kings of judah had not known and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent ones
5  they built the high places of baʹal in order to burn their sons in the fire as whole burnt offerings to baʹal something that i had not commanded or spoken of and that had never even come into my heart
6  therefore look the days are coming declares jehovah when this place will no longer be called toʹpheth or the valley of the son of hinʹnom but the valley of the slaughter
7  i will thwart the plans of judah and jerusalem in this place and i will make them fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those seeking to take their life
and i will give their dead bodies as food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth
8  and i will make this city an object of horror and something to whistle at
every last one passing by it will stare in horror and whistle over all its plagues
9  and i will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters and they will each eat the flesh of his fellow man because of the siege and their desperation when they are hemmed in by their enemies and those seeking to take their life
10  then break the flask before the eyes of the men who go with you
11  and say to them this is what jehovah of armies says this is how i will break this people and this city like someone who breaks a potters vessel so that it can never be repaired and they will bury the dead in toʹpheth until there is no more room to bury them
12  that is what i will do to this place declares jehovah and to its inhabitants to make this city like toʹpheth
13  and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah will become unclean like this place toʹpheth yes all the houses on whose roofs they offered sacrifices to all the army of the heavens and where they poured out drink offerings to other gods
14  when jeremiah returned from toʹpheth where jehovah sent him to prophesy he stood in the courtyard of the house of jehovah and said to all the people
15  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says here i am bringing on this city and on all its towns all the calamity that i have spoken against it because they stubbornly refused to obey my words
24  then jehovah showed me two baskets of figs set before the temple of jehovah after king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon had carried into exile jeconiʹah son of jehoiʹakim the king of judah along with the princes of judah the craftsmen and the metalworkers he took them from jerusalem to babylon
2  one basket had very good figs like early figs but the other basket had very bad figs so bad that they could not be eaten
3  jehovah then asked me what do you see jeremiah so i said figs the good figs are very good but the bad ones are very bad so bad that they cannot be eaten
4  then the word of jehovah came to me saying
5  this is what jehovah the god of israel says like these good figs so i will regard in a good way the exiles of judah whom i have sent away from this place to the land of the chaldeʹans
6  i will keep my eye on them for their good and i will cause them to return to this land
i will build them up and i will not tear down i will plant them and i will not uproot
7  and i will give them a heart to know me that i am jehovah
they will become my people and i will become their god for they will return to me with all their heart
8  but concerning the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten this is what jehovah says so i will regard king zedekiʹah of judah his princes the remnant of jerusalem who are left in this land and those who are dwelling in the land of egypt
9  i will make them an object of horror and calamity to all the kingdoms of the earth a reproach a proverbial saying a cause for ridicule and a curse in all the places to which i disperse them
10  and i will send against them the sword the famine and the pestilence until they have perished from the land that i gave to them and to their forefathers
43  when jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all these words from jehovah their god every single word that jehovah their god had sent him to tell them
2  azariʹah the son of hoshaiʹah johaʹnan the son of kareʹah and all the presumptuous men said to jeremiah what you are saying is a lie jehovah our god has not sent you to say do not go to egypt to reside there
3  but barʹuch the son of neriʹah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the chaldeʹans to put us to death or to take us into exile in babylon
4  so johaʹnan the son of kareʹah and all the army chiefs and all the people disobeyed the voice of jehovah to remain in the land of judah
5  instead johaʹnan the son of kareʹah and all the army chiefs took with them all the remnant of judah who had returned to reside in the land of judah from all the nations where they had been dispersed
6  they took the men the women the children the daughters of the king and everyone whom nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard had left with gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan as well as jeremiah the prophet and barʹuch the son of neriʹah
7  and they went into the land of egypt for they did not obey the voice of jehovah and they went as far as tahʹpanhes
8  then the word of jehovah came to jeremiah in tahʹpanhes saying
9  take in your hand large stones and hide them in the mortar in the brick terrace at the entrance of the house of pharʹaoh in tahʹpanhes with the jewish men looking on
10  then say to them this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says here i am sending for nebuchadnezʹzar the king of babylon my servant and i will place his throne right above these stones that i have hidden and he will extend his royal tent over them
11  and he will come in and strike the land of egypt
whoever is meant for deadly plague will be for deadly plague and whoever is meant for captivity will be for captivity and whoever is meant for the sword will be for the sword
12  and i will set the houses of the gods of egypt on fire and he will burn them and lead them captive
he will wrap the land of egypt around himself just as a shepherd wraps himself in his garment and he will depart from there in peace
13  and he will break to pieces the pillars of bethsheʹmesh in the land of egypt and he will burn the houses of the gods of egypt with fire
44  the word that came to jeremiah for all the jews living in the land of egypt those living in migʹdol tahʹpanhes noph and the land of pathʹros saying
2  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says you have seen all the calamity that i brought on jerusalem and on all the cities of judah and today they are in ruins without an inhabitant
3  it is because of the evil things that they did to offend me by going and making sacrifices and serving other gods whom they had not known neither you nor your forefathers
4  i kept sending all my servants the prophets to you sending them again and again saying please do not do this detestable thing that i hate
5  but they did not listen or incline their ear to turn back from their evil by not making sacrifices to other gods
6  so my wrath and my anger were poured out and burned in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they became a ruin and a wasteland as they are today
7  and now this is what jehovah the god of armies the god of israel says why are you causing a great calamity to yourselves so that every man and woman child and infant will perish from judah leaving you without a remnant
8  why should you offend me with the works of your hands by sacrificing to other gods in the land of egypt where you have gone to reside you will perish and become an object of cursing and a reproach among all the nations of the earth
9  have you forgotten the wicked deeds of your forefathers and the wicked deeds of the kings of judah and the wicked deeds of their wives as well as your own wicked deeds and the wicked deeds of your wives that were done in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
10  down to this day they have not humbled themselves they have shown no fear nor have they walked in my law and my statutes that i set before you and your forefathers
11  therefore this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says here i am determined to bring calamity on you to destroy all judah
12  and i will take the remnant of judah who were determined to go to the land of egypt to reside there and they will all perish in the land of egypt
they will fall by the sword and perish by the famine from the least to the greatest they will die by the sword and by famine
and they will become a curse an object of horror a malediction and a reproach
13  i will punish those dwelling in the land of egypt just as i punished jerusalem with the sword with famine and with pestilence
14  and the remnant of judah who have gone to reside in the land of egypt will not escape or survive to return to the land of judah
they will long to return and dwell there but they will not return except for a few escapees
15  all the men who knew that their wives had been making sacrifices to other gods and all the wives who were standing there who formed a large group and all the people who were living in the land of egypt in pathʹros answered jeremiah
16  we will not listen to the word that you have spoken to us in the name of jehovah
17  instead we will surely carry out every word that our mouths have spoken to make sacrifices to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her just as we our forefathers our kings and our princes did in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem when we were satisfied with bread and were welloff when we saw no calamity at all
18  from the time we quit making sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her we have lacked everything and have perished by the sword and by the famine
19  the women added and when we were making sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her was it without the consent of our husbands that we made sacrificial cakes shaped in her image and we poured out drink offerings to her
20  then jeremiah said to all the people to the men and their wives and to all the people who were speaking to him
21  the sacrifices that you your forefathers your kings your princes and the people of the land made in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalemjehovah remembered them and they came up into his heart
22  finally jehovah could no longer put up with your evil practices and the detestable things you had done and your land became a devastated place an object of horror and cursing without an inhabitant as it is today
23  it is because you have made these sacrifices and because you have sinned against jehovah by not obeying the voice of jehovah and following his law his statutes and his reminders that this calamity has come upon you as is the case today
24  jeremiah continued to say to all the people and to all the women hear the word of jehovah all you of judah who are in the land of egypt
25  this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says what you and your wives have spoken with your mouths you have fulfilled with your hands for you said we will surely carry out our vows to make sacrifices to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her
you women will surely carry out your vows and perform your vows
26  therefore hear the word of jehovah all you of judah who are living in the land of egypt here i swear by my own great name says jehovah that my name will no longer be called on in an oath by any man of judah in all the land of egypt who says as surely as the sovereign lord jehovah is alive
27  now i am watching over them to bring calamity and not something good all the men of judah in the land of egypt will perish by the sword and by the famine until they cease to exist
28  only a few will escape the sword and return from the land of egypt to the land of judah
then all the remnant of judah who came to the land of egypt to reside there will know whose word has come true mine or theirs
29  and this is the sign for you declares jehovah that i will punish you in this place so that you will know that my words promising calamity against you will surely come true
30  this is what jehovah says here i am giving pharʹaoh hophʹra the king of egypt into the hand of his enemies and of those seeking to take his life just as i gave king zedekiʹah of judah into the hand of king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon who was his enemy and who sought to take his life
47  this is the word of jehovah to jeremiah the prophet concerning the philisʹtines before pharʹaoh struck down gazʹa
2  this is what jehovah says look waters are coming from the north
they will become a flooding torrent
and they will flood the land and everything in itthe city and those inhabiting it
the men will cry outand everyone dwelling in the land will wail
3  at the sound of the pounding hooves of his stallionsat the rattling of his war chariotsand the rumbling of his wheelsfathers will not even turn around for their sonsfor their hands fall limp
4  because the day that is coming will destroy all the philisʹtinesit will cut off from tyre and siʹdon every remaining ally
for jehovah will destroy the philisʹtineswho are the remaining ones from the island of caphʹtor
5  baldness will come to gazʹa
ashʹkelon has been silenced
o remnant of their valley plainhow long will you keep making cuts on yourself
6  ah the sword of jehovah how long will you not be quiet go back into your sheath
take your rest and be silent
7  how can it be quietwhen jehovah has given it a command against ashʹkelon and the seacoastthere is where he has assigned it
48  for moʹab this is what jehovah of armies the god of israel says woe to neʹbo for she has been destroyed kiriathaʹim has been put to shame and captured
the secure refuge has been put to shame and shattered
2  they no longer praise moʹab
in heshʹbon they have plotted her downfall come let us put an end to her as a nation
you too o madʹmen should keep silentfor the sword is following you
3  there is the sound of an outcry from horonaʹimof destruction and great collapse
4  moʹab has been broken down
her little ones cry out
5  on the ascent of luʹhith they weep continually as they climb
and on the way down from horonaʹim they hear cries of distress over the catastrophe
6  flee escape for your lives you must become like a juniper tree in the wilderness
7  because you trust in your works and in your treasuresyou will also be captured
and cheʹmosh will go into exiletogether with his priests and his princes
8  the destroyer will come in on every cityand no city will escape
the valley will perishand the level land will be annihilated just as jehovah has said
9  set up a marker for moʹabfor as she falls into ruins she will fleeand her cities will become an object of horrorwithout an inhabitant
10  cursed is the one who carries out the mission of jehovah neglectfully cursed is the one who holds back his sword from bloodshed
11  the moʹabites have been undisturbed since their youthlike wine that has settled on the dregs
they have not been poured from one vessel into anotherand they have never gone into exile
that is why their taste has remained the sameand their aroma has not changed
12  therefore look the days are coming declares jehovah when i will send men to overturn them
they will turn them over and empty out their vessels and they will smash their large jars to pieces
13  and the moʹabites will be ashamed of cheʹmosh just as the house of israel is ashamed of bethʹel which was their confidence
14  how dare you say we are mighty warriors ready for battle
15  moʹab has been destroyedher cities have been invadedand their choicest young men have been slaughtered declares the king whose name is jehovah of armies
16  the disaster on the moʹabites is coming soonand their downfall is approaching quickly
17  all those around them will have to sympathize with themall those knowing their name
tell them o how the mighty rod has been broken the staff of beauty
18  come down from your gloryand sit down in thirst o daughter inhabiting diʹbonfor the destroyer of moʹab has come against youand he will bring your fortified places to ruin
19  stand by the road and watch inhabitant of aroʹer
ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping what has happened
20  moʹab has been put to shame and struck with terror
wail and cry out
proclaim in arʹnon that moʹab has been destroyed
21  judgment has come to the level land against hoʹlon jaʹhaz and mephʹaath
22  against diʹbon neʹbo and bethdiblathaʹim
23  against kiriathaʹim bethgaʹmul and bethmeʹon
24  against keʹrioth and bozʹrah and against all the cities of the land of moʹab those far and near
25  the strength of moʹab has been cut downhis arm has been broken declares jehovah
26  make him drunk for he has exalted himself against jehovah
moʹab wallows in his vomitand he is an object of ridicule
27  was israel not an object of ridicule to you was he found among thievesso that you should shake your head and speak against him
28  leave the cities and live on the crag inhabitants of moʹaband become like a dove that nests along the sides of the gorge
29  we have heard about the pride of moʹabhe is very haughtyabout his arrogance his pride his haughtiness and the loftiness of his heart
30  i know his fury declares jehovahbut his empty talk will come to nothing
they will do nothing
31  that is why i will wail over moʹabfor all moʹab i will cry outand moan for the men of kirheʹres
32  with more than the weeping for jaʹzeri will weep for you o vine of sibʹmah
your flourishing shoots have crossed the sea
to the sea to jaʹzer they have reached
upon your summer fruit and your grape harvestthe destroyer has descended
33  rejoicing and joyfulness have been removed from the orchardand from the land of moʹab
i have caused the wine to stop flowing from the winepress
no one will be treading with shouts of joy
the shouting will be different shouting
34  there is an outcry from heshʹbon clear to eleaʹleh
they raise their voice clear to jaʹhazfrom zoʹar to horonaʹim to egʹlathsheliʹshiyah
even the waters of nimʹrim will become desolate
35  i will cause to cease from moʹab declares jehovahthe one bringing an offering on the high placeand the one making sacrifices to his god
36  that is why my heart will moan for moʹab like a fluteand my heart will moan for the men of kirheʹres like a flute
for the wealth he has produced will perish
37  for every head is baldand every beard is clipped
there are cuts on every handand there is sackcloth on their hips
38  on all the roofs of moʹaband in all her public squaresthere is nothing but wailing
for i have broken moʹablike a discarded jar declares jehovah
39  how she is terrified wail how moʹab has turned his back in shame moʹab has become an object of ridiculesomething terrifying to all those around him
40  for this is what jehovah says look just like an eagle that swoops downhe will spread his wings over moʹab
41  the towns will be capturedand her strongholds will be seized
in that day the heart of moʹabs warriorswill be like the heart of a woman in childbirth
42  and moʹab will be annihilated from being a peoplefor it is against jehovah that he has exalted himself
43  terror and the pit and the trap are before youo inhabitant of moʹab declares jehovah
44  anyone fleeing the terror will fall into the pitand anyone coming up from the pit will be caught in the trap
for i will bring on moʹab the year of their punishment declares jehovah
45  in the shadow of heshʹbon those fleeing stand powerless
for a fire will come out of heshʹbonand a flame from within siʹhon
it will consume the forehead of moʹaband the skull of the sons of tumult
46  woe to you o moʹab the people of cheʹmosh have perished
for your sons have been taken captiveand your daughters have gone into exile
47  but i will gather the captives of moʹab in the final part of the days declares jehovah
down to this point is the judgment on moʹab
5  roam the streets of jerusalem
look around and take note
search her public squares to seewhether you can find a man who acts with justiceone who seeks to be faithfuland i will forgive her
2  even if they say as surely as jehovah is alive they would still swear to what is false
3  o jehovah do your eyes not look for faithfulness you struck them but it made no impact on them
you exterminated them but they refused to accept discipline
they made their faces harder than a rockand they refused to turn around
4  but i said to myself surely these must be the lowly
they act foolishly for they do not know the way of jehovahthe judgment of their god
5  i will go to the prominent men and speak with themfor they must have taken note of the way of jehovahthe judgment of their god
but they had all broken the yokeand torn apart the restraints
6  that is why a lion of the forest attacks thema wolf of the desert plains keeps ravaging thema leopard lies awake at their cities
everyone going out from them is torn to pieces
for their transgressions are manytheir acts of unfaithfulness are numerous
7  how can i forgive you for this your sons have abandoned meand they swear by what is no god
i satisfied their needsbut they kept committing adulteryand they flocked to the house of a prostitute
8  they are like eager lustful horseseach neighing after another mans wife
9  should i not call them to account for these things declares jehovah
should i not avenge myself on such a nation
10  come up against her vineyard terraces and bring ruinbut do not make a complete extermination
take away her spreading shootsfor they do not belong to jehovah
11  for the house of israel and the house of judahhave been utterly treacherous with me declares jehovah
12  they have denied jehovah and they keep sayinghe will do nothing
no calamity will come upon uswe will not see sword or famine
13  the prophets are full of windand the word is not in them
let this happen to them
14  therefore this is what jehovah the god of armies says because these men are saying thishere i am making my words a fire in your mouthand this people is the woodand it will consume them
15  here i am bringing in on you a nation from far away o house of israel declares jehovah
it is an enduring nation
it is an ancient nationa nation whose language you do not knowand whose speech you cannot understand
16  their quiver is like an open graveall of them are warriors
17  they will devour your harvest and your bread
they will devour your sons and your daughters
they will devour your flocks and your herds
they will devour your vines and your fig trees
they will destroy with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust
18  but even in those days declares jehovah i will not carry out a complete extermination of you
19  and when they ask why has jehovah our god done all these things to us you should answer them just as you abandoned me to serve a foreign god in your land so you will serve foreigners in a land that is not yours
20  declare this in the house of jacoband proclaim it in judah saying
21  hear this you foolish and senseless people they have eyes but cannot seethey have ears but cannot hear
22  do you not fear me declares jehovahshould you not tremble before me it is i who placed the sand as the boundary for the seaa permanent regulation that it cannot pass over
although its waves toss they cannot prevailalthough they roar they still cannot pass beyond it
23  but this people has a stubborn and rebellious heartthey have turned aside and gone their own way
24  and they do not say in their heart let us now fear jehovah our godthe one who gives the rain in its seasonboth the autumn rain and the spring rainthe one who guards for us the appointed weeks of the harvest
25  your own errors have prevented these things from comingyour own sins have deprived you of what is good
26  for among my people there are wicked men
they keep peering as when birdcatchers crouch down
they set a deadly trap
it is men whom they catch
27  like a cage full of birdsso their houses are full of deception
that is why they have become powerful and rich
28  they have grown fat and smooththey overflow with evil
they do not plead the legal case of the fatherlessthat they may gain successand they deny justice to the poor
29  should i not call them to account for these things declares jehovah
should i not avenge myself on such a nation
30  something appalling and horrible has occurred in the land
31  the prophets prophesy liesand the priests dominate by their own authority
and my own people love it that way
but what will you do when the end comes
36  now in the fourth year of jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judah this word came to jeremiah from jehovah saying
2  take a scroll and write in it all the words that i have spoken to you against israel and judah and all the nations from the first day i spoke to you in the days of josiʹah to this day
3  perhaps when those of the house of judah hear of all the calamity that i intend to bring on them they may turn back from their evil ways so that i may forgive their error and their sin
4  jeremiah then called barʹuch the son of neriʹah and jeremiah dictated all the words that jehovah had spoken to him and barʹuch wrote them in the scroll
5  then jeremiah commanded barʹuch i am confined and unable to enter the house of jehovah
6  so you are the one who must go in and read aloud the words of jehovah from the scroll that you wrote at my dictation
read them in the hearing of the people at the house of jehovah on the day of a fast thus you will read them to all the people of judah who come in from their cities
7  perhaps their request for favor will reach jehovah and they will turn back each one from his evil ways for great is the anger and the wrath that jehovah has declared against this people
8  so barʹuch the son of neriʹah did all that jeremiah the prophet had commanded him he read aloud from the scroll the words of jehovah at the house of jehovah
9  now in the fifth year of jehoiʹakim son of josiʹah the king of judah in the ninth month all the people in jerusalem and all the people who came into jerusalem from the cities of judah proclaimed a fast before jehovah
10  barʹuch then read aloud from the scroll the words of jeremiah at the house of jehovah in the chamber of gemariʹah the son of shaʹphan the copyist in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the new gate of the house of jehovah in the hearing of all the people
11  when micaiʹah the son of gemariʹah the son of shaʹphan heard all the words of jehovah from the scroll
12  he went down to the house of the king to the secretarys chamber
all the princes were sitting there elishʹama the secretary delaʹiah the son of shemaiʹah elnaʹthan the son of achʹbor gemariʹah the son of shaʹphan zedekiʹah the son of hananiʹah and all the other princes
13  micaiʹah told them all the words that he had heard when barʹuch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people
14  then all the princes sent jehuʹdi the son of nethaniʹah the son of shelemiʹah the son of cushʹi to barʹuch saying come and bring with you the scroll from which you read in the hearing of the people
barʹuch the son of neriʹah took the scroll in his hand and went in to them
15  they said to him sit down please and read it aloud to us
so barʹuch read it to them
16  now as soon as they heard all the words they looked at one another in dread and they said to barʹuch we must certainly tell the king all these words
17  and they asked barʹuch tell us please how you wrote all these words
was it at his dictation
18  barʹuch replied to them he dictated all these words to me and i wrote them down with ink in this scroll
19  the princes said to barʹuch go and hide yourselves you and jeremiah and do not let anyone know where you are
20  then they went in to the king to the courtyard and deposited the scroll in the chamber of elishʹama the secretary and they told the king everything they had heard
21  so the king sent jehuʹdi out to get the scroll and he brought it from the chamber of elishʹama the secretary
jehuʹdi began to read it in the hearing of the king and of all the princes standing by the king
22  the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month with a fire burning in the brazier before him
23  after jehuʹdi had read three or four columns the king would cut off that portion with the secretarys knife and pitch it into the fire that was burning in the brazier until the entire scroll ended up in the fire that was in the brazier
24  and they felt no dread neither the king nor all his servants who heard all these words ripped their garments apart
25  although elnaʹthan delaʹiah and gemariʹah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll he did not listen to them
26  further the king commanded jerahʹmeel the son of the king seraiʹah the son of azʹriel and shelemiʹah the son of abʹdeel to seize barʹuch the secretary and jeremiah the prophet but jehovah kept them concealed
27  and the word of jehovah again came to jeremiah after the king had burned up the scroll containing the words that barʹuch had written at jeremiahs dictation saying
28  take another scroll and write on it all the same words that were on the first scroll which king jehoiʹakim of judah burned up
29  and you should say against king jehoiʹakim of judah this is what jehovah says you have burned up this scroll and said why have you written on it the king of babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and empty it of man and beast
30  therefore this is what jehovah says against king jehoiʹakim of judah he will have no one to sit on the throne of david and his dead body will be left exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night
31  i will call him and his descendants and his servants to account for their error and i will bring on them and on the inhabitants of jerusalem and on the men of judah all the calamity that i have spoken against them but they did not listen
32  jeremiah then took another scroll and gave it to barʹuch the son of neriʹah the secretary and at jeremiahs dictation he wrote on it all the words of the scroll that king jehoiʹakim of judah had burned in the fire
and many more words like those were added
41  in the seventh month ishʹmael son of nethaniʹah son of elishʹama who was of the royal line and one of the principal men of the king came with ten other men to gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam at mizʹpah
as they were eating a meal together in mizʹpah
2  ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah and the ten men who were with him rose up and struck down gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan with the sword
so he put to death the one whom the king of babylon had appointed over the land
3  ishʹmael also struck down all the jews who were with gedaliʹah in mizʹpah as well as the chaldeʹan soldiers who were there
4  on the second day after gedaliʹah had been put to death before anyone knew about it
5  there came 80 men from sheʹchem from shiʹloh and from samarʹia
their beards were shaved off their garments were ripped apart they had cut themselves and they had grain offerings and frankincense in their hand to bring to the house of jehovah
6  so ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah went out from mizʹpah to meet them weeping as he walked along
when he encountered them he said to them come to gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam
7  but when they came into the city ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah and his men slaughtered them and threw them into the cistern
8  but there were ten men among them who said to ishʹmael do not put us to death for we have hidden stores of wheat barley oil and honey in the field
so he refrained from putting them to death along with their brothers
9  now ishʹmael threw all the carcasses of the men he had killed into a great cistern the one that king aʹsa had made because of king baʹasha of israel
this was the cistern that ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah filled with the slain men
10  ishʹmael took captive all the rest of the people in mizʹpah including the daughters of the king and all the people left in mizʹpah whom nebuʹzaradʹan the chief of the guard had put in the custody of gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam
ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah took them captive and went off to cross over to the amʹmonites
11  when johaʹnan the son of kareʹah and all the army chiefs who were with him heard about all the evil that ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah had done
12  they took all the men and went off to fight against ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah and they found him by the great waters in gibʹeon
13  all the people who were with ishʹmael rejoiced when they saw johaʹnan the son of kareʹah and all the army chiefs with him
14  then all the people whom ishʹmael had taken captive from mizʹpah turned around and went back with johaʹnan the son of kareʹah
15  but ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah and eight of his men escaped from johaʹnan and went to the amʹmonites
16  johaʹnan the son of kareʹah and all the army chiefs who were with him took with them the rest of the people from mizʹpah those whom they had rescued from ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah after he had struck down gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam
they brought the men the soldiers the women the children and the court officials back from gibʹeon
17  so they went and stayed in the lodging place of chimʹham next to bethʹlehem intending to go on into egypt
18  because of the chaldeʹans
for they had become afraid of them since ishʹmael the son of nethaniʹah had struck down gedaliʹah the son of ahiʹkam whom the king of babylon had appointed over the land
15  then jehovah said to me even if moses and samuel were standing before me i would show no favor toward this people
drive them out from before me
let them go
2  and if they say to you where should we go you must say to them this is what jehovah says whoever is for deadly plague to deadly plague whoever is for the sword to the sword whoever is for the famine to the famine and whoever is for the captivity to the captivity
3  and i will appoint over them four calamities declares jehovah the sword to kill the dogs to drag away and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy
4  and i will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of manasʹseh the son of hezekiʹah the king of judah for what he did in jerusalem
5  who will show compassion to you o jerusalemwho will sympathize with youand who will stop to ask about your welfare
6  you have deserted me declares jehovah
you keep turning your back on me
so i will stretch out my hand against you and destroy you
i am tired of feeling pity for you
7  and i will winnow them with a fork in the gates of the land
i will bereave them of children
i will destroy my peoplesince they refuse to turn back from their ways
8  their widows will become more numerous before me than the sand of the seas
i will bring a destroyer against them at midday against mothers and young men
i will bring agitation and terror upon them suddenly
9  the woman who bore seven children has grown faintshe struggles for breath
her sun has set while it is yet daycausing shame and humiliation
and those few remaining ones of themi will give to the sword before their enemies declares jehovah
10  woe to me o my mother because you gave birth to mea man subject to quarrel and strife with all the land
i have neither loaned nor borrowedbut all of them curse me
11  jehovah said i will surely minister to you for goodi will surely intercede for you in the time of calamityin the time of distress against the enemy
12  can anyone break iron in piecesiron from the north and copper
13  your resources and your treasures i will give as plundernot for a price but because of all your sins throughout all your territories
14  i will give them to your enemiesto take to a land you do not know
for a fire has been ignited by my angerand it is burning against you
15  you know o jehovahremember me and turn your attention to me
take vengeance on my persecutors for me
do not let me perish because of your slowness to anger
know that for your sake i bear this reproach
16  your words were found and i ate themand your word became to me the exultation and the rejoicing of my heartfor your name has been called on me o jehovah god of armies
17  i do not sit in the company of merrymakers and rejoice
because your hand is upon me i sit alonefor you have filled me with indignation
18  why is my pain chronic and my wound incurable it refuses to be healed
will you become to me like a deceptive water supplythat cannot be relied on
19  therefore this is what jehovah says if you return then i will restore youand you will stand before me
if you separate what is precious from what is worthlessyou will become like my own mouth
they will have to turn to youbut you will not turn to them
20  i am making you a fortified copper wall to this people
they will certainly fight against youbut they will not prevail against youfor i am with you to save you and to rescue you declares jehovah
21  and i will rescue you from the hand of the wickedand redeem you from the palm of the ruthless
20  now pashʹhur the son of imʹmer the priest who was also the leading commissioner in the house of jehovah was listening when jeremiah prophesied these things
2  then pashʹhur struck jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the upper gate of benjamin which was in the house of jehovah
3  but on the following day when pashʹhur released jeremiah from the stocks jeremiah said to him jehovah has named you not pashʹhur but terror all around
4  for this is what jehovah says i will make you an object of terror to yourself and to all your friends and they will fall by the sword of their enemies while your eyes are looking on and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he will take them into exile in babylon and put them to death by the sword
5  and i will give all the wealth of this city all its resources all its precious things and all the treasures of the kings of judah into the hand of their enemies
and they will plunder them and seize them and take them to babylon
6  and as for you pashʹhur and all who live in your house you will go into captivity
you will go off to babylon and die there and you will be buried there with all your friends because you have prophesied lies to them
7  you have fooled me o jehovah and i was fooled
you used your strength against me and you prevailed
i have become a laughingstock all day longeveryone ridicules me
8  for whenever i speak i must cry out and proclaimviolence and destruction for me the word of jehovah has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long
9  so i said i am not going to make mention of himand i will speak no more in his name
but in my heart it became like a burning fire shut up in my bonesand i was tired of holding it ini could no longer endure it
10  for i heard many evil rumorsterror surrounded me
denounce him let us denounce him every man wishing me peace was watching for my downfall perhaps he will make a foolish mistakeand we can prevail and take our revenge against him
11  but jehovah was with me like a fearsome warrior
that is why those persecuting me will stumble and will not prevail
they will be put to great shame for they will not succeed
their everlasting humiliation will not be forgotten
12  but you o jehovah of armies are examining the righteous oneyou see the innermost thoughts and the heart
let me see your vengeance on themfor to you i have committed my legal case
13  sing to jehovah praise jehovah for he has rescued the poor one from the hand of evildoers
14  cursed be the day i was born may the day my mother gave birth to me not be blessed
15  cursed be the man who brought good news to my father saying a son has been born to you a boy making him rejoice greatly
16  may that man become like cities that jehovah overthrew without regret
may he hear an outcry in the morning and the sound of alarm at midday
17  why did he not put me to death in the wombso that my mother would become my burial placeand her womb would always remain pregnant
18  why did i have to come out of the wombto see trouble and griefto end my days in shame
1  these are the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiʹah one of the priests in anʹathoth in the land of benjamin
2  the word of jehovah came to him in the days of josiʹah the son of aʹmon the king of judah in the 13th year of his reign
3  it came also in the days of jehoiʹakim the son of josiʹah the king of judah until the completion of the 11th year of zedekiʹah the son of josiʹah the king of judah until jerusalem went into exile in the fifth month
4  the word of jehovah came to me saying
5  before i formed you in the womb i knew youand before you were born i sanctified you
i made you a prophet to the nations
6  but i said alas o sovereign lord jehovah i do not know how to speak for i am just a boy
7  jehovah then said to me do not say i am just a boy
for you must go to all those to whom i send youand you should say everything that i command you
8  do not be afraid because of their appearancefor i am with you to save you declares jehovah
9  then jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth
and jehovah said to me i have put my words in your mouth
10  see i have commissioned you this day to be over the nations and over the kingdoms to uproot and to pull down to destroy and to tear down to build and to plant
11  the word of jehovah again came to me saying what do you see jeremiah so i said i see the branch of an almond tree
12  jehovah said to me you have seen correctly for i am wide awake concerning my word to carry it out
13  the word of jehovah came to me a second time saying what do you see so i said i see a boiling pot and its mouth is tilted away from the north
14  then jehovah said to me out of the north the calamity will break looseagainst all the inhabitants of the land
15  for i am summoning all the families of the kingdoms of the north declares jehovahand they will come each one will set up his throneat the entrance of the gates of jerusalemagainst her walls all aroundand against all the cities of judah
16  and i will declare my judgments against them over all their wickednessbecause they have abandoned meand they are making sacrificial smoke to other godsand bowing down to the works of their own hands
17  but you should prepare for actionand you must stand up and tell them everything that i command you
do not be terrified of themso that i do not terrify you before them
18  for today i have made you a fortified cityan iron pillar and copper walls against all the landtoward the kings of judah and her princestoward her priests and the people of the land
19  and they will certainly fight against youbut they will not prevail against youfor i am with you declares jehovah to save you
2  the word of jehovah came to me saying
2  go and proclaim in the ears of jerusalem this is what jehovah says i well remember the devotion of your youththe love you showed when you were engaged to marryhow you followed me in the wildernessin a land not sown with seed
3  israel was holy to jehovah the firstfruits of his harvest
anyone devouring him would become guilty
disaster would come upon them declares jehovah
4  hear the word of jehovah o house of jacoband all you families of the house of israel
5  this is what jehovah says what fault did your forefathers find in meso that they strayed so far from meand they walked after worthless idols and became worthless themselves
6  they did not ask where is jehovahthe one who brought us out of the land of egyptwho led us through the wildernessthrough a land of deserts and pitsthrough a land of drought and of deep shadowthrough a land where no man travelsand where no humans dwell
7  i then brought you to a land of orchardsto eat its fruitage and its good things
but you came in and defiled my landyou made my inheritance something detestable
8  the priests did not ask where is jehovah those handling the law did not know methe shepherds rebelled against methe prophets prophesied by baʹaland they followed those who could bring no benefit
9  so i will contend further with you declares jehovahand i will contend with the sons of your sons
10  but cross over to the coastlands of the kitʹtim and see
yes send to keʹdar and consider carefullysee whether anything like this has happened
11  has a nation ever changed its gods for those that are not gods but my own people have exchanged my glory for what is useless
12  stare in amazement at this you heavensshudder in absolute horror declares jehovah
13  because my people have done two bad things they have abandoned me the source of living waterand dug for themselves cisternsbroken cisterns that cannot hold water
14  is israel a servant or a slave born in the household then why has he been given over to plunder
15  against him young lions roarthey have raised their voice
they made his land an object of horror
his cities have been set on fire so that there is no inhabitant
16  the people of noph and tahʹpanes feed on the crown of your head
17  have you not brought this on yourselfby abandoning jehovah your godwhile he was leading you in the way
18  now why do you wish for the way to egyptto drink the waters of shiʹhor why do you wish for the way to assyrʹiato drink the waters of the river
19  your wickedness should correct youand your own unfaithfulness should reprove you
know and realize how bad and bitter it isto abandon jehovah your godyou have shown no fear of me declares the sovereign lord jehovah of armies
20  for long ago i smashed your yokeand tore off your shackles
but you said i am not going to serve for on every high hill and under every luxuriant treeyou were lying sprawled out prostituting yourself
21  i planted you as a choice red vine all of it pure seedso how have you turned into the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine before me
22  though you should wash with soda and use much lyeyour guilt would still be a stain before me declares the sovereign lord jehovah
23  how can you say i have not defiled myself
i have not followed the baʹals look at your way in the valley
consider what you have done
you are like a swift young shecamelaimlessly running back and forth in her ways
24  a wild donkey accustomed to the wildernesssniffing the wind in her lust
who can restrain her when she is in heat none of those looking for her will need to weary themselves
in her season they will find her
25  keep your feet from going bareand your throat from thirst
but you said it is hopeless no i have fallen in love with strangersand i will follow them
26  like the shame of a thief when he is caughtso the house of israel has been put to shamethey their kings and their princestheir priests and their prophets
27  they say to a tree you are my father and to a stone you gave birth to me
but to me they turn their back and not their face
and in the time of their calamity they will sayrise up and save us
28  now where are your gods that you made for yourself let them rise up if they can save you in your time of calamityfor your gods have become as numerous as your cities o judah
29  why do you keep contending against me why have all of you rebelled against me declares jehovah
30  i have struck your sons in vain
they would accept no disciplineyour own sword devoured your prophetslike a marauding lion
31  o generation consider for yourselves the word of jehovah
have i become like a wilderness to israelor a land of oppressive darkness why have these my people said we roam freely
we will come to you no more
32  can a virgin forget her ornamentsa bride her breastbands and yet my own people have forgotten me for countless days
33  how skillfully o woman you set your course to seek love you have trained yourself in the ways of wickedness
34  even your skirts are stained with the blood of the innocent poor onesthough i did not find them in the act of breaking init is on all your skirts
35  but you say i am innocent
surely his anger has turned back from me
now i am bringing judgment against youbecause you say i have not sinned
36  why do you treat so lightly your unstable course you will become ashamed of egypt toojust as you became ashamed of assyrʹia
37  for this reason also you will go out with your hands on your headfor jehovah has rejected those in whom you put confidencethey will not bring you success
3  people ask if a man sends his wife away and she leaves him and becomes another mans should he return to her anymore has that land not been utterly polluted you have committed prostitution with many companionsand should you now return to me declares jehovah
2  raise your eyes to the bare hills and see
where have you not been raped you sat along the roadways for themlike a nomad in the wilderness
you keep polluting the landwith your prostitution and your wickedness
3  so showers of rain are withheldand there is no rain in the spring
you have the brazen look of a wife who commits prostitutionyou refuse to feel shame
4  but now you call out to memy father you are the companion of my youth
5  should one stay resentful foreveror always hold a grudge this is what you saybut you keep doing all the evil you are capable of doing
6  in the days of king josiʹah jehovah said to me have you seen what unfaithful israel has done she has gone up on every high mountain and underneath every luxuriant tree to commit prostitution
7  even after she did all these things i kept telling her to return to me but she did not return and judah kept watching her treacherous sister
8  when i saw that i sent unfaithful israel away with a full certificate of divorce because of her adultery
but her treacherous sister judah did not become afraid she too went out and committed prostitution
9  she took her prostitution lightly and she kept polluting the land and committing adultery with stones and with trees
10  despite all this her treacherous sister judah did not return to me with all her heart only in pretense declares jehovah
11  jehovah then said to me unfaithful israel has shown herself to be more righteous than treacherous judah
12  go and proclaim these words to the north return o renegade israel declares jehovah
i will not look down angrily on you for i am loyal declares jehovah
i will not stay resentful forever
13  only acknowledge your guilt for you have rebelled against jehovah your god
you continued scattering your favors to strangers under every luxuriant tree but you would not obey my voice declares jehovah
14  return you renegade sons declares jehovah
for i have become your true master and i will take you one from a city and two from a family and i will bring you to zion
15  and i will give you shepherds after my own heart and they will feed you with knowledge and insight
16  you will become many and will bear fruit in the land in those days declares jehovah
no more will they say the ark of the covenant of jehovah it will not come up into the heart nor will they remember it or miss it and it will not be made again
17  at that time they will call jerusalem the throne of jehovah and all the nations will be brought together to the name of jehovah at jerusalem and they will no longer stubbornly follow their own wicked heart
18  in those days they will walk together the house of judah alongside the house of israel and together they will come from the land of the north into the land that i gave to your forefathers as an inheritance
19  and i thought how i placed you among the sons and gave you the desirable land the most beautiful inheritance among the nations i also thought that you would call me my father and that you would not turn away from following me
20  truly as a wife treacherously leaves her husband so also you o house of israel have dealt treacherously with me declares jehovah
21  on the bare hills a sound is heardthe weeping and the pleading of the people of israelfor they have distorted their waythey have forgotten jehovah their god
22  return you renegade sons
i will heal your renegade condition
here we are we have come to youfor you o jehovah are our god
23  truly the hills and the turmoil on the mountains are a delusion
truly in jehovah our god is the salvation of israel
24  but the shameful thing has consumed the toil of our forefathers since our youththeir flocks and their herdstheir sons and their daughters
25  let us lie down in our shameand let our disgrace cover usfor we have sinned against jehovah our godwe and our fathers since our youth until this dayand we have not obeyed the voice of jehovah our god
33  the word of jehovah came to jeremiah the second time while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guard saying
2  this is what jehovah the maker of earth says jehovah who formed it and firmly established it jehovah is his name
3  call to me and i will answer you and readily tell you great and incomprehensible things that you have not known
4  for this is what jehovah the god of israel says concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of judah that are pulled down because of the siege ramparts and the sword
5  and concerning those who are coming to fight the chaldeʹans filling these places with the carcasses of those whom i struck down in my anger and in my wrath those whose evil has caused me to hide my face from this city
6  here i am bringing recuperation and health to her and i will heal them and reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth
7  and i will bring back the captives of judah and the captives of israel and i will build them up as i did at the start
8  and i will purify them from all the guilt of their sins against me and i will forgive all the guilt of their sins and their transgressions against me
9  and she will become to me a name of exultation a praise and a beauty before all the nations of the earth who will hear of all the goodness that i bestow on them
and they will be in dread and will tremble because of all the goodness and peace that i will bestow on her
10  this is what jehovah says in this place that you will say is a wasteland without man or livestock in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man or inhabitant or livestock there will again be heard
11  the sound of exultation and the sound of rejoicing the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of those saying give thanks to jehovah of armies for jehovah is good his loyal love endures forever they will bring thanksgiving offerings into the house of jehovah for i will bring back the captives of the land as at the start says jehovah
12  this is what jehovah of armies says in this wasteland without man or livestock and in all its cities there will again be pastures for the shepherds to rest their flocks
13  in the cities of the mountainous region in the cities of the lowland in the cities of the south in the land of benjamin in the areas around jerusalem and in the cities of judah flocks will again pass under the hands of the one counting them says jehovah
14  look the days are coming declares jehovah when i will fulfill the good promise that i have spoken concerning the house of israel and the house of judah
15  in those days and at that time i will cause to sprout for david a righteous sprout and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land
16  in those days judah will be saved and jerusalem will reside in security
and this is what she will be called jehovah is our righteousness
17  for this is what jehovah says there will never fail to be a man from davids line to sit on the throne of the house of israel
18  nor will the levitical priests ever fail to have a man stand before me to offer whole burnt offerings to burn grain offerings and to offer sacrifices
19  and the word of jehovah again came to jeremiah saying
20  this is what jehovah says if you could break my covenant regarding the day and my covenant regarding the night to prevent day and night from coming at their proper time
21  only then could my covenant with my servant david be broken so that he should not have a son ruling as king on his throne and so also my covenant with the levitical priests my ministers
22  just as the army of the heavens cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured so i will multiply the offspring of my servant david and the levites who are ministering to me
23  and the word of jehovah again came to jeremiah saying
24  have you not taken note of what this people is saying jehovah will reject the two families that he chose and they are treating my own people with disrespect and they no longer regard them as a nation
25  this is what jehovah says just as surely as i have established my covenant regarding the day and the night the laws of heaven and earth
26  so i will never reject the offspring of jacob and of my servant david so as not to take from his offspring rulers over the descendants of abraham isaac and jacob
for i will gather back their captives and have pity on them
12  you are righteous o jehovah when i make my complaint to youwhen i speak about matters of justice with you
but why is the way of wicked ones successfuland why are the treacherous unworried
2  you planted them and they have taken root
they have grown and produced fruit
you are on their lips but far away from their innermost thoughts
3  but you know me well o jehovah you see meyou have examined my heart and found it in union with you
single them out like sheep for slaughteringand set them apart for the day of killing
4  how much longer should the land wither awayand the vegetation of every field dry up because of the evil of those dwelling in itthe beasts and the birds have been swept away
for they have said he does not see what will happen to us
5  if you get tired running with footmenhow can you run a race against horses even if you are confident in the land of peacehow will you fare among the dense thickets along the jordan
6  for even your own brothers the household of your own fatherhave dealt treacherously with you
they have raised a loud cry against you
do not put faith in themeven if they speak good things to you
7  i have abandoned my house i have deserted my inheritance
i have given my dearly beloved one into the hand of her enemies
8  my inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest
she has roared against me
so i have come to hate her
9  my inheritance is like a multicolored bird of prey to methe other birds of prey surround it and attack it
come gather together all you beasts of the fieldcome to eat
10  many shepherds have destroyed my vineyardthey have trampled my portion of land
they have turned my desirable portion of land into a desolate wilderness
11  it has become a wasteland
it has witheredit is desolate before me
the whole land has been made desolatebut no man takes it to heart
12  on all the worn paths through the wilderness the destroyers have comefor the sword of jehovah is devouring from one end of the land to the other end
there is no peace for anyone
13  they have sown wheat but they have reaped thorns
they have worn themselves out but to no benefit
they will be ashamed of their producebecause of the burning anger of jehovah
14  this is what jehovah says against all my wicked neighbors who are touching the inheritance that i caused my people israel to possess here i am uprooting them from their land and i will uproot the house of judah from among them
15  but after i uproot them i will again have mercy on them and bring each of them back to his inheritance and to his land
16  and if they make sure to learn the ways of my people and to swear by my name as surely as jehovah is alive just as they taught my people to swear by baʹal they will then be built up among my people
17  but if they refuse to obey i will also uproot that nation uprooting and destroying it declares jehovah
