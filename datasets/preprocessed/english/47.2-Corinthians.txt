10  now i myself paul appeal to you by the mildness and kindness of the christ lowly though i am when among you facetoface but bold toward you when absent
2  i beg that when present i may not have to be bold and take the strong measures that i expect against some who view us as if we walked in a fleshly manner
3  for though we walk in the flesh we do not wage warfare according to what we are in the flesh
4  for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful by god for overturning strongly entrenched things
5  for we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of god and we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the christ
6  and we are prepared to inflict punishment for every disobedience as soon as your own obedience is complete
7  you look at things according to their face value
if anyone is confident in himself that he belongs to christ let him reflect again on this fact just as he belongs to christ so do we also
8  for even if i should boast a bit too much about the authority that the lord gave us to build you up and not to tear you down i would not be put to shame
9  for i do not want to seem as though i were trying to terrify you by my letters
10  for they say his letters are weighty and forceful but his presence in person is weak and his speech contemptible
11  let such a man consider that what we say by letters when absent this we will also do when present
12  for we do not dare to class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who recommend themselves
but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves they are without understanding
13  however we will not boast outside our assigned boundaries but within the boundary of the territory that god measured out to us making it reach even as far as you
14  really we are not overextending ourselves as if we did not reach you for we were the first to reach as far as you with the good news about the christ
15  no we are not boasting outside our assigned boundaries about the labors of someone else but we hope that as your faith continues to increase what we have done may be made to increase within our territory
then we will abound still more
16  so that we may declare the good news to the countries beyond you so as not to boast in what has already been done in someone elses territory
17  but the one who boasts let him boast in jehovah
18  for it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved but the one whom jehovah recommends
4  therefore since we have this ministry through the mercy that was shown us we do not give up
2  but we have renounced the shameful underhanded things not walking with cunning or adulterating the word of god but by making the truth manifest we recommend ourselves to every human conscience in the sight of god
3  if in fact the good news we declare is veiled it is veiled among those who are perishing
4  among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so that the illumination of the glorious good news about the christ who is the image of god might not shine through
5  for we are preaching not about ourselves but about jesus christ as lord and ourselves as your slaves for jesus sake
6  for god is the one who said let the light shine out of darkness and he has shone on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of god by the face of christ
7  however we have this treasure in earthen vessels so that the power beyond what is normal may be gods and not from us
8  we are hardpressed in every way but not cramped beyond movement we are perplexed but not absolutely with no way out
9  we are persecuted but not abandoned we are knocked down but not destroyed
10  always we endure in our body the deathdealing treatment that jesus suffered that the life of jesus may also be made manifest in our body
11  for we who live are ever being brought facetoface with death for jesus sake so that the life of jesus may also be made manifest in our mortal flesh
12  so death is at work in us but life in you
13  now because we have the same spirit of faith as that of which it is written i exercised faith therefore i spoke we too exercise faith and therefore we speak
14  knowing that the one who raised jesus up will raise us up also with jesus and will present us together with you
15  for all these things are for your sake so that the increase of the undeserved kindness should abound even more because many more are offering thanksgiving to the glory of god
16  therefore we do not give up but even if the man we are outside is wasting away certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day
17  for though the tribulation is momentary and light it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting
18  while we keep our eyes not on the things seen but on the things unseen
for the things seen are temporary but the things unseen are everlasting
11  i wish you would put up with me in a little unreasonableness
but in fact you are putting up with me
2  for i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i personally promised you in marriage to one husband that i might present you as a chaste virgin to the christ
3  but i am afraid that somehow as the serpent seduced eve by its cunning your minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity that are due the christ
4  for as it is if someone comes and preaches a jesus other than the one we preached or you receive a spirit other than what you received or good news other than what you accepted you easily put up with him
5  for i consider that i have not proved inferior to your superfine apostles in a single thing
6  but even if i am unskilled in speech i certainly am not in knowledge indeed we made it clear to you in every way and in everything
7  or did i commit a sin by humbling myself that you might be exalted because i gladly declared the good news of god to you without cost
8  other congregations i deprived by accepting provisions in order to minister to you
9  yet when i was present with you and i fell into need i did not become a burden on anyone for the brothers who came from macedoʹnia abundantly supplied my needs
yes in every way i kept myself from becoming a burden to you and will continue to do so
10  as surely as the truth of christ is in me i will not stop this boasting in the regions of achaʹia
11  for what reason because i do not love you god knows i do
12  but what i am doing i will continue to do in order to eliminate the pretext of those who are wanting a basis for being found equal to us in the things about which they boast
13  for such men are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ
14  and no wonder for satan himself keeps disguising himself as an angel of light
15  it is therefore nothing extraordinary if his ministers also keep disguising themselves as ministers of righteousness
but their end will be according to their works
16  i say again let no one think i am unreasonable
but even if you do then accept me as an unreasonable person so that i too may boast a little
17  what i now say is not as following the lords example but as an unreasonable person would with boastful selfconfidence
18  since many are boasting according to the flesh i too will boast
19  since you are so reasonable you gladly put up with the unreasonable ones
20  in fact you put up with whoever enslaves you whoever devours your possessions whoever grabs what you have whoever exalts himself over you and whoever strikes you in the face
21  i say this to our dishonor since it may seem that we have acted in weakness
but if others act boldlyi am talking unreasonablyi too act boldly
22  are they hebrews i am one also
are they israelites i am one also
are they abrahams offspring i am also
23  are they ministers of christ i reply like a madman i am more outstandingly one i have done more work been imprisoned more often suffered countless beatings and experienced many neardeaths
24  five times i received 40 strokes less one from the jews
25  three times i was beaten with rods once i was stoned three times i experienced shipwreck a night and a day i have spent in the open sea
26  in journeys often in dangers from rivers in dangers from robbers in dangers from my own people in dangers from the nations in dangers in the city in dangers in the wilderness in dangers at sea in dangers among false brothers
27  in labor and toil in sleepless nights often in hunger and thirst frequently without food in cold and lacking clothing
28  besides those things of an external kind there is what rushes in on me from day to day the anxiety for all the congregations
29  who is weak and i am not weak who is stumbled and i am not incensed
30  if i must boast i will boast of the things that show my weakness
31  the god and father of the lord jesus the one who is to be praised forever knows i am not lying
32  in damascus the governor under areʹtas the king was guarding the city of the damascenesʹ to seize me
33  but i was lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall and i escaped his hands
8  now we want you to know brothers about the undeserved kindness of god that has been granted to the congregations of macedoʹnia
2  during a great test under affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty made the riches of their generosity abound
3  for it was according to their means yes i testify it was even beyond their means
4  while they on their own initiative kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of kindly giving to have a share in the relief ministry for the holy ones
5  and not merely as we had hoped but first they gave themselves to the lord and to us through gods will
6  so we encouraged titus that just as he had initiated this work among you he should also complete this same kind giving on your part
7  nevertheless just as you abound in everything in faith and word and knowledge and all earnestness and in our love for you may you also abound in this kind giving
8  i am saying this not to command you but to make you aware of the earnestness of others and to test the genuineness of your love
9  for you know the undeserved kindness of our lord jesus christ that although he was rich he became poor for your sake so that you might become rich through his poverty
10  and in this i give my opinion this is for your benefit seeing that already a year ago you not only initiated the action but also showed your desire to do it
11  so now also complete what you started to do so that your readiness to act may be completed according to the means you have available
12  for if the readiness is there first it is especially acceptable according to what a person has not according to what a person does not have
13  for i do not want to make it easy for others but difficult for you
14  but that by means of an equalizing your surplus at the present time might offset their need so that their surplus might also offset your deficiency that there may be an equalizing
15  just as it is written the person with much did not have too much and the person with little did not have too little
16  now thanks be to god for putting the same earnest concern for you in the heart of titus
17  because he has indeed responded to the encouragement but being very eager he is coming to you on his own initiative
18  but we are sending along with him the brother whose praise in connection with the good news has spread through all the congregations
19  not only that but he was also appointed by the congregations to be our traveling companion as we administer this kind gift for the glory of the lord and in proof of our readiness to assist
20  thus we are avoiding having any man find fault with us in connection with this liberal contribution that we are administering
21  for we care for everything honestly not only in the sight of jehovah but also in the sight of men
22  moreover we are sending with them our brother whom we have often tested and found to be diligent in many matters but now much more diligent on account of his great confidence in you
23  if though there is any question about titus he is my companion and a fellow worker for your interests or if there are questions about our brothers they are apostles of congregations and a glory of christ
24  so demonstrate the proof of your love to them and show the congregations why we boasted about you
9  now concerning the ministry that is for the holy ones it is not really necessary for me to write you
2  for i know your willingness about which i am boasting to the macedoʹnians that achaʹia has been ready now for a year and your zeal has stirred up the majority of them
3  but i am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you might not prove empty in this respect and that you may really be ready just as i said you would be
4  otherwise if the macedoʹnians should come with me and find you not ready wenot to mention youshould be put to shame by our confidence in you
5  so i thought it necessary to encourage the brothers to come to you ahead of time and to get your promised bountiful gift ready in advance so that this might be ready as a generous gift and not as something extorted
6  but as to this whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully
7  let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart not grudgingly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver
8  moreover god is able to cause all his undeserved kindness to abound toward you so that you are always completely selfsufficient in everything as well as having plenty for every good work
9  just as it is written he has distributed widely he has given to the poor
his righteousness continues forever
10  now the one who abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the harvest of your righteousness
11  in everything you are being enriched for every sort of generosity which produces through us an expression of thanks to god
12  because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide well for the needs of the holy ones but also to be rich in many expressions of thanks to god
13  through the proof that this relief ministry gives they glorify god because you are submissive to the good news about the christ as you publicly declared and because you are generous in your contribution to them and to all
14  and with supplication for you they express affection for you because of the surpassing undeserved kindness of god upon you
15  thanks be to god for his indescribable free gift
7  therefore since we have these promises beloved ones let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
2  make room for us in your hearts
we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have taken advantage of no one
3  i do not say this to condemn you
for i have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together
4  i have great freeness of speech toward you
i have great boasting in regard to you
i am filled with comfort i am overflowing with joy in all our affliction
5  in fact when we arrived in macedoʹnia our bodies got no relief but we continued to be afflicted in every waythere were fights on the outside fears within
6  but god who comforts those who are downhearted comforted us by the presence of titus
7  and not only by his presence but also by the comfort he received because of you as he reported back to us about your longing for me your deep sorrow and your earnest concern for me so i rejoiced even more
8  for even if i saddened you by my letter i do not regret it
even if i did at first regret it seeing that the letter saddened you though only for a little while
9  now i rejoice not because you were just saddened but because you were saddened into repenting
for you were saddened in a godly way so that you suffered no harm because of us
10  for sadness in a godly way produces repentance leading to salvation leaving no regret but the sadness of the world produces death
11  for see what a great earnestness your being saddened in a godly way produced in you yes clearing of yourselves yes indignation yes fear yes earnest desire yes zeal yes righting of the wrong in every respect you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in this matter
12  although i wrote to you i did not do it for the one who did the wrong nor for the one who was wronged but so that your earnestness for us might be made evident among you in the sight of god
13  that is why we have been comforted
but in addition to our comfort we rejoiced even more over the joy of titus because all of you refreshed his spirit
14  for if i have boasted to him about you i have not been put to shame but just as all the things we told you were true so also our boasting to titus has proved true
15  also his tender affections toward you are greater as he remembers the obedience of all of you how you received him with fear and trembling
16  i rejoice that in every way i may have confidence in you
6  working together with him we also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of god and miss its purpose
2  for he says in an acceptable time i heard you and in a day of salvation i helped you
look now is the especially acceptable time
look now is the day of salvation
3  in no way are we giving any cause for stumbling so that no fault may be found with our ministry
4  but in every way we recommend ourselves as gods ministers by the endurance of much by tribulations by times of need by difficulties
5  by beatings by imprisonments by riots by hard work by sleepless nights by times without food
6  by purity by knowledge by patience by kindness by holy spirit by love free from hypocrisy
7  by truthful speech by gods power through the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left
8  through glory and dishonor through bad report and good report
we are regarded as deceivers and yet we are truthful
9  as unknown and yet we are recognized as dying and yet look we live as punished and yet not handed over to death
10  as sorrowing but ever rejoicing as poor but making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things
11  we have opened our mouth to speak to you corinthians and we have opened wide our heart
12  we are not restricted in our affections for you but you are restricted in your own tender affections for us
13  so in responsei speak as to my childrenyou too open your hearts wide
14  do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers
for what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have or what sharing does light have with darkness
15  further what harmony is there between christ and beʹlial or what does a believer share in common with an unbeliever
16  and what agreement does gods temple have with idols for we are a temple of a living god just as god said i will reside among them and walk among them and i will be their god and they will be my people
17  therefore get out from among them and separate yourselves says jehovah and quit touching the unclean thing and i will take you in
18  and i will become a father to you and you will become sons and daughters to me says jehovah the almighty
13  this is the third time i am coming to you
on the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter must be established
2  although i am absent now it is as if i were present for the second time and i give my warning in advance to those who sinned previously and to all the rest that if ever i come again i will not spare them
3  since you are seeking proof that christ who is not weak toward you but strong among you is really speaking through me
4  for indeed he was executed on the stake because of weakness but he is alive because of gods power
true we also are weak with him but we will live together with him because of gods power toward you
5  keep testing whether you are in the faith keep proving what you yourselves are
or do you not recognize that jesus christ is in union with you unless you are disapproved
6  i truly hope you will recognize that we are not disapproved
7  now we pray to god that you may do nothing wrong not that we may appear approved but that you may do what is fine even if we may appear disapproved
8  for we can do nothing against the truth but only for the truth
9  we certainly rejoice whenever we are weak but you are powerful
and this is what we are praying for your being readjusted
10  that is why i write these things while absent so that when i am present i may not have to be severe in using the authority that the lord gave me to build up and not to tear down
11  finally brothers continue to rejoice to be readjusted to be comforted to think in agreement to live peaceably and the god of love and of peace will be with you
12  greet one another with a holy kiss
13  all the holy ones send you their greetings
14  the undeserved kindness of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the sharing in the holy spirit be with all of you
5  for we know that if our earthly house this tent should be torn down we are to have a building from god a house not made with hands everlasting in the heavens
2  for in this house we do indeed groan earnestly desiring to put on the one for us from heaven
3  so that when we do put it on we will not be found naked
4  in fact we who are in this tent groan being weighed down because we do not want to put this one off but we want to put the other on so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life
5  now the one who prepared us for this very thing is god who gave us the spirit as a token of what is to come
6  so we are always of good courage and know that while we have our home in the body we are absent from the lord
7  for we are walking by faith not by sight
8  but we are of good courage and would prefer to be absent from the body and to make our home with the lord
9  so whether at home with him or absent from him we make it our aim to be acceptable to him
10  for we must all appear before the judgment seat of the christ so that each one may be repaid according to the things he has practiced while in the body whether good or bad
11  therefore since we know the fear of the lord we keep persuading men but we are wellknown to god
however i hope that we are wellknown also to your consciences
12  we are not recommending ourselves to you again but giving you an incentive to boast about us so that you may be able to answer those who boast over the outward appearance but not over what is in the heart
13  for if we were out of our mind it was for god if we are sound in mind it is for you
14  for the love the christ has compels us because this is what we have concluded that one man died for all so then all had died
15  and he died for all so that those who live should live no longer for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised up
16  so from now on we know no man from a fleshly viewpoint
even if we once knew christ according to the flesh we certainly no longer know him in that way
17  therefore if anyone is in union with christ he is a new creation the old things passed away look new things have come into existence
18  but all things are from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of the reconciliation
19  namely that god was by means of christ reconciling a world to himself not counting their offenses against them and he entrusted to us the message of the reconciliation
20  therefore we are ambassadors substituting for christ as though god were making an appeal through us
as substitutes for christ we beg become reconciled to god
21  the one who did not know sin he made to be sin for us so that by means of him we might become gods righteousness
1  paul an apostle of christ jesus through gods will and timothy our brother to the congregation of god that is in corinth including all the holy ones who are in all achaʹia
2  may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
3  praised be the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of tender mercies and the god of all comfort
4  who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from god
5  for just as the sufferings for the christ abound in us so the comfort we receive through the christ also abounds
6  now if we face trials it is for your comfort and salvation and if we are being comforted it is for your comfort which acts to help you to endure the same sufferings that we also suffer
7  and our hope for you is unwavering knowing as we do that just as you share in the sufferings so you will also share in the comfort
8  for we do not want you to be unaware brothers of the tribulation we experienced in the province of asia
we were under extreme pressure beyond our own strength so that we were very uncertain even of our lives
9  in fact we felt that we had received the sentence of death
this was so that we would trust not in ourselves but in the god who raises up the dead
10  from such a great risk of death he did rescue us and will rescue us and our hope is in him that he will also continue to rescue us
11  you also can help us by your supplication for us in order that many may give thanks in our behalf for the favor we receive in answer to the prayers of many
12  for the thing we boast of is this our conscience bears witness that we have conducted ourselves in the world and especially toward you with holiness and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but with gods undeserved kindness
13  for we are really not writing you about anything except what you can read and understand and i hope you will continue to understand these things fully
14  just as you have also understood to an extent that we are a cause for you to boast just as you will also be for us in the day of our lord jesus
15  so with this confidence i was intending to come first to you so that you might have a second occasion for joy
16  for i intended to visit you on my way to macedoʹnia to return to you from macedoʹnia and then to have you send me off to judeʹa
17  well when i had such an intention i did not view the matter lightly did i or do i purpose things in a fleshly way so that i am saying yes yes and then no no
18  but god can be relied on that what we say to you is not yes and yet no
19  for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you through us that is through me and silvaʹnus and timothy did not become yes and yet no but yes has become yes in his case
20  for no matter how many the promises of god are they have become yes by means of him
therefore also through him is the amen said to god which brings him glory through us
21  but the one who guarantees that you and we belong to christ and the one who anointed us is god
22  he has also put his seal on us and has given us the token of what is to come that is the spirit in our hearts
23  now i call on god as a witness against me that it is to spare you that i have not yet come to corinth
24  not that we are the masters over your faith but we are fellow workers for your joy for it is by your faith that you are standing
2  for i have made up my mind not to come to you again in sadness
2  for if i make you sad who will be there to cheer me up except the one i saddened
3  i wrote what i did so that when i come i may not be saddened by those over whom i ought to rejoice because i have confidence that what brings me joy brings all of you the same joy
4  for out of much tribulation and anguish of heart i wrote you with many tears not to sadden you but to let you know the depth of love i have for you
5  now if anyone has caused sadness he has saddened not me but all of you to an extentnot to be too harsh in what i say
6  this rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man
7  now you should instead kindly forgive and comfort him so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sadness
8  i therefore exhort you to confirm your love for him
9  for this is also why i wrote to you to determine whether you would give proof of your obedience in all things
10  if you forgive anyone for anything i do also
in fact whatever i have forgiven if i have forgiven anything has been for your sake in christs sight
11  so that we may not be overreached by satan for we are not ignorant of his designs
12  now when i arrived in troʹas to declare the good news about the christ and a door was opened to me in the lord
13  my spirit felt no relief because of not finding titus my brother
so i said goodbye to them and departed for macedoʹnia
14  but thanks be to god who always leads us in a triumphal procession in company with the christ and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him in every place
15  for to god we are a sweet fragrance of christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing
16  to the latter ones an odor of death leading to death to the former ones a fragrance of life leading to life
and who is adequately qualified for these things
17  we are for we are not peddlers of the word of god as many men are but we speak in all sincerity as sent from god yes in the sight of god and in company with christ
3  are we starting to recommend ourselves again or do we need like some men letters of recommendation to you or from you
2  you yourselves are our letter inscribed on our hearts and known and being read by all mankind
3  for you are shown to be a letter of christ written by us as ministers inscribed not with ink but with the spirit of a living god not on stone tablets but on fleshly tablets on hearts
4  we have this sort of confidence toward god through the christ
5  not that we of ourselves are adequately qualified to consider that anything comes from us but our being adequately qualified comes from god
6  who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant not of a written code but of spirit for the written code condemns to death but the spirit makes alive
7  now if the code that administers death and that was engraved in letters on stones came with such glory that the sons of israel could not gaze at the face of moses because of the glory of his face a glory that was to be done away with
8  why should the administering of the spirit not be with even greater glory
9  for if the code administering condemnation was glorious how much more glorious would be the administering of righteousness
10  in fact even what had once been made glorious has been stripped of glory because of the glory that excels it
11  for if what was to be done away with was brought in with glory how much greater would be the glory of what remains
12  since we have such a hope we are using great freeness of speech
13  and not doing what moses did when he would put a veil over his face so that the sons of israel might not gaze intently at the end of what was to be done away with
14  but their minds were dulled
for to this present day the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read because it is taken away only by means of christ
15  in fact to this day whenever moses is read a veil lies upon their hearts
16  but when one turns to jehovah the veil is taken away
17  now jehovah is the spirit and where the spirit of jehovah is there is freedom
18  and all of us while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of jehovah are transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another exactly as it is done by jehovah the spirit
12  i have to boast
it is not beneficial but i will move on to supernatural visions and revelations of the lord
2  i know a man in union with christ who 14 years agowhether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knowswas caught away to the third heaven
3  yes i know such a manwhether in the body or apart from the body i do not know god knows
4  who was caught away into paradise and heard words that cannot be spoken and that are not lawful for a man to say
5  i will boast about such a man but i will not boast about myself except of my weaknesses
6  for even if i want to boast i will not be unreasonable for i would say the truth
but i refrain from doing so in order that no one should give me more credit than what he sees in me or hears from me
7  just because of receiving such extraordinary revelations
to keep me from becoming overly exalted i was given a thorn in the flesh an angel of satan to keep slapping me so that i might not be overly exalted
8  three times i begged the lord about this that it would depart from me
9  but he said to me my undeserved kindness is sufficient for you for my power is being made perfect in weakness
most gladly then i will boast about my weaknesses in order that the power of the christ may remain over me like a tent
10  so i take pleasure in weaknesses in insults in times of need in persecutions and difficulties for christ
for when i am weak then i am powerful
11  i have become unreasonable
you compelled me to for i ought to have been recommended by you
for i did not prove to be inferior to your superfine apostles in a single thing even if i am nothing
12  indeed the signs of an apostle were produced among you with great endurance and by signs and wonders and powerful works
13  for how were you less favored than the rest of the congregations except that i myself did not become a burden to you kindly forgive me for this wrong
14  look this is the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not become a burden
for i am seeking not your possessions but you for the children are not expected to save up for their parents but the parents for their children
15  for my part i will most gladly spend and be completely spent for you
if i love you so much more am i to be loved the less
16  but be that as it may i did not burden you
nevertheless you say i was crafty and i caught you by trickery
17  i did not take advantage of you through any of those whom i sent to you did i
18  i urged titus and i sent the brother with him
titus did not take advantage of you at all did he we walked in the same spirit did we not in the same footsteps did we not
19  have you been thinking all along that we have been making our defense to you it is before god that we are speaking in union with christ
but beloved ones all that we do is to build you up
20  for i am afraid that somehow when i arrive i may not find you as i wish and i may not be as you wish but instead there may be strife jealousy outbursts of anger dissension backbiting whispering being puffed up with pride and disorder
21  perhaps when i come again my god might humiliate me before you and i may have to mourn over many of those who previously sinned but have not repented of their uncleanness and sexual immorality and brazen conduct that they have practiced
