1  a pronouncement that habakʹkuk the prophet received in a vision
2  how long o jehovah must i cry for help but you do not hear how long must i ask for help from violence but you do not intervene
3  why do you make me witness wrongdoing and why do you tolerate oppression why are destruction and violence before me and why do quarreling and conflict abound
4  so law is paralyzedand justice is never carried out
for the wicked surround the righteousthat is why justice is perverted
5  look among the nations and pay attention stare in amazement and be astoundedfor something will happen in your daysthat you will not believe even if it is told to you
6  for here i am raising up the chaldeʹansthe ruthless and impetuous nation
they sweep through vast stretches of the earthto seize homes not theirs
7  they are frightening and fearsome
they establish their own justice and authority
8  their horses are swifter than leopardsand they are fiercer than wolves in the night
their warhorses gallop forwardtheir horses come from far away
they swoop down like the eagle rushing to feed
9  all of them come bent on violence
the assembling of their faces is like the east windand they scoop up captives like sand
10  they scoff at kingsand laugh at high officials
they laugh at every fortified placethey pile up a dirt ramp and capture it
11  then they move forward like the wind and pass throughbut they will become guiltybecause they credit their power to their god
12  are you not from everlasting o jehovah o my god my holy one you do not die
o jehovah you appointed them to execute judgmentmy rock you established them for punishment
13  your eyes are too pure to look on what is eviland you cannot tolerate wickedness
why then do you tolerate the treacherousand keep silent when a wicked man swallows up someone more righteous than he is
14  why do you make man like the fish of the sealike creeping things that have no ruler
15  all of these he hauls up with a fishhook
he catches them in his dragnetand he gathers them in his fishing net
that is why he rejoices greatly
16  that is why he offers sacrifices to his dragnetand makes sacrifices to his fishing netfor by them his portion is richand his food is choice
17  will he then keep emptying out his dragnet will he go on slaughtering nations without compassion
2  at my guardpost i will keep standingand i will station myself on the rampart
i will keep watch to see what he will speak by means of meand what i will reply when i am reproved
2  jehovah then answered me write down the vision and inscribe it clearly on tabletsso that the one reading aloud from it may do so easily
3  for the vision is yet for its appointed timeand it is rushing toward its end and it will not lie
even if it should delay keep in expectation of it for it will without fail come true
it will not be late
4  look at the one who is proudhe is not upright within himself
but the righteous one will live by his faithfulness
5  indeed because the wine is treacherousthe arrogant man will not reach his goal
he makes his appetite as large as the gravehe is like death and cannot be satisfied
he keeps gathering all the nationsand collecting for himself all the peoples
6  will not all of these speak a proverb an allusion and riddles against him they will say woe to him who accumulates what is not hisfor how longand who makes even greater his own debt
7  will not your creditors rise up suddenly they will wake up and violently shake youand you will become something for them to plunder
8  because you plundered many nationsall the rest of the peoples will plunder youbecause of your shedding mens bloodand your violence to the earthto the cities and those living in them
9  woe to the one who makes evil gain for his houseso as to set his nest on the heightto escape the grasp of calamity
10  you have plotted shame against your house
by wiping out many peoples you sin against yourself
11  for a stone will cry out from the walland from the woodwork a rafter will answer it
12  woe to the one who builds a city by bloodshedand who establishes a town by unrighteousness
13  look is it not from jehovah of armies that peoples will work hard to feed the fireand that nations tire themselves out for nothing
14  for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of jehovahas the waters cover the sea
15  woe to the one who gives his companions something to drinkadding to it rage and anger to make them drunkin order to look on their nakedness
16  you will be glutted with dishonor rather than glory
you toodrink and expose your uncircumcised condition
the cup in the right hand of jehovah will come around to youand disgrace will cover over your glory
17  for the violence done to lebʹanon will cover youand the destruction that terrified the beasts will come upon youbecause of your shedding mens bloodand your violence to the earthto the cities and those living in them
18  of what benefit is a carved imagewhen its maker has carved it of what benefit is a metal statue and a teacher of lieseven though its maker trusts in itmaking worthless gods that are speechless
19  woe to the one who says to a piece of wood awake or to a speechless stone wake up instruct us look it is overlaid in gold and silverand there is no breath at all within it
20  but jehovah is in his holy temple
be silent before him all the earth
3  the prayer of habakʹkuk the prophet in dirges
2  o jehovah i have heard the report about you
i am in awe o jehovah of your activity
in the midst of the years bring it to life in the midst of the years make it known
may you remember to show mercy during the turmoil
3  god came from teʹmanthe holy one from mount paʹran
selah his majesty covered the heavenswith his praise the earth was filled
4  his brightness was like the light
two rays flashed from his handwhere his strength was hidden
5  before him went pestilenceand burning fever followed at his feet
6  he stood still and shook the earth
with a look he made nations leap
the eternal mountains were smashedand the ancient hills bowed down
the paths of long ago are his
7  i saw trouble in the tents of cuʹshan
the tent cloths of the land of midʹian trembled
8  is it against the rivers o jehovahis it against the rivers that your anger is burning or is your fury against the sea for you rode on your horsesyour chariots were victorious
9  your bow is uncovered and ready
the rods are assigned with an oath
selah you split the earth with rivers
10  mountains writhed in pain at the sight of you
a downpour of waters swept through
the deep roared with its voice
it lifted its hands high
11  sun and moon stood still in their lofty abode
your arrows went out like the light
the lightning of your spear was brilliant
12  you marched through the earth with indignation
you trampled the nations in anger
13  you went out for the salvation of your people to save your anointed one
you crushed the leader of the house of the wicked
it was exposed from the foundation to the top
selah
14  you pierced the head of his warriors with his own weaponswhen they stormed out to scatter me
they were overjoyed to devour an afflicted one in secret
15  through the sea you trod with your horsesthrough the surging of vast waters
16  i heard and i trembled withinat the sound my lips quivered
rottenness entered my bonesmy legs beneath me were shaking
but i quietly wait for the day of distressfor it is coming upon the people who attack us
17  although the fig tree may not blossomand there may be no fruit on the vinesalthough the olive crop may failand the fields may produce no foodalthough the flock may disappear from the penand there may be no cattle in the stalls
18  yet as for me i will exult in jehovahi will be joyful in the god of my salvation
19  the sovereign lord jehovah is my strengthhe will make my feet like those of a deerand cause me to tread on high places
