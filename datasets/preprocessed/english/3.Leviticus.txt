10  later aarons sons naʹdab and abiʹhu each took his fire holder and put fire in it and placed incense on it
then they began offering before jehovah unauthorized fire which he had not commanded them to do
2  at this a fire came out from before jehovah and consumed them so that they died before jehovah
3  then moses said to aaron this is what jehovah has said i will be made holy among those near to me and i will be glorified before all the people
and aaron kept silent
4  so moses called mishʹael and elzaʹphan the sons of uzʹziel aarons uncle and said to them come here carry your brothers from in front of the holy place to a place outside the camp
5  so they came forward and carried the men away in their robes to a place outside the camp just as moses had told them
6  moses then said to aaron and his other sons eleaʹzar and ithʹamar do not let your heads go ungroomed or tear your garments so that you may not die and that god may not become indignant against all the assembly
your brothers of the whole house of israel will weep over those whom jehovah has killed by the fire
7  you must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting or you will die for jehovahs anointing oil is upon you
so they did according to moses word
8  then jehovah said to aaron
9  do not drink wine or other alcoholic beverages you and your sons with you when you come into the tent of meeting so that you will not die
it is a permanent statute for your generations
10  this is to distinguish between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean
11  and to teach the israelites all the regulations that jehovah has spoken to them through moses
12  then moses spoke to aaron and to eleaʹzar and ithʹamar his sons who were left take what was left of the grain offering from jehovahs offerings made by fire and eat it as unleavened bread near the altar because it is something most holy
13  you must eat it in a holy place because it is your allowance and the allowance of your sons from jehovahs offerings made by fire for this is what i have been commanded
14  you will also eat the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion in a clean place you and your sons and your daughters with you because these things have been given as your allowance and the allowance of your sons from the communion sacrifices of the israelites
15  they will bring the leg of the sacred portion and the breast of the wave offering along with the offerings of fat made by fire in order to wave the wave offering back and forth before jehovah and it will serve as a permanent allowance for you and your sons with you just as jehovah has commanded
16  and moses diligently searched for the goat of the sin offering and he discovered that it had been burned up
so he grew indignant at eleaʹzar and ithʹamar aarons sons who were left and he said
17  why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place since it is something most holy and he has given it to you so that you may answer for the error of the assembly and make atonement for them before jehovah
18  look its blood has not been brought inside the holy place
you certainly should have eaten it in the holy place just as i was commanded
19  aaron replied to moses look today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before jehovah and yet these things happened to me
if i had eaten the sin offering today would that have been pleasing to jehovah
20  when moses heard that he was satisfied
4  jehovah went on to say to moses
2  tell the israelites if someone sins unintentionally by doing any of the things that jehovah commanded should not be done
3  if the anointed priest sins and brings guilt on the people then he must present a sound young bull to jehovah as a sin offering for the sin he committed
4  he will bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before jehovah and lay his hand on the bulls head and he is to slaughter the bull before jehovah
5  then the anointed priest will take some of the bulls blood and bring it into the tent of meeting
6  and the priest will dip his finger in the blood and spatter some of the blood seven times before jehovah in front of the curtain of the holy place
7  the priest will also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of perfumed incense which is before jehovah in the tent of meeting and he will pour all the rest of the bulls blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting
8  he will then remove all the fat of the bull of the sin offering including the fat that covers the intestines and the fat that surrounds the intestines
9  and the two kidneys with the fat on them that is near the loins
and he will remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys
10  it will be the same as what is removed from a bull of the communion sacrifice
and the priest will make them smoke on the altar of burnt offering
11  but as for the skin of the bull and all its flesh along with its head its shanks its intestines and its dung
12  all the rest of the bullhe will have it taken to the outskirts of the camp to a clean place where the ashes are discarded and he will burn it on wood in the fire
it should be burned where the ashes are discarded
13  now if the entire assembly of israel has become guilty by committing a sin unintentionally but the congregation was unaware that they had done something that jehovah commanded them not to do
14  and then the sin becomes known the congregation must present a young bull for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting
15  the elders of the assembly will lay their hands on the bulls head before jehovah and the bull will be slaughtered before jehovah
16  then the anointed priest will bring some of the bulls blood into the tent of meeting
17  the priest is to dip his finger into the blood and spatter some of it seven times before jehovah in front of the curtain
18  he will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before jehovah which is in the tent of meeting and he will pour all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting
19  he will remove all its fat and make it smoke on the altar
20  he is to do to the bull just as he did to the other bull of the sin offering
that is how he will do it and the priest will make atonement for them and they will be forgiven
21  he will have the bull taken to the outskirts of the camp and will burn it just as he burned the first bull
it is a sin offering for the congregation
22  when a chieftain unintentionally sins by doing one of all the things that jehovah his god commands should not be done and has become guilty
23  or if he becomes aware of a sin that he has committed against the commandment then he must bring a sound young male goat as his offering
24  he will lay his hand on the head of the young goat and slaughter it in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before jehovah
it is a sin offering
25  the priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and he will pour the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering
26  he will make all its fat smoke on the altar like the fat of the communion sacrifice and the priest will make atonement for him for his sin and it will be forgiven him
27  if any one of the people of the land sins unintentionally and becomes guilty by doing one of the things that jehovah commands should not be done
28  or if he becomes aware of a sin that he has committed then he should bring a sound young female goat as his offering for the sin he has committed
29  he will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the same place as the burnt offering
30  the priest will take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and he will pour all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar
31  he will remove all its fat just as the fat is removed from the communion sacrifice and the priest will make it smoke on the altar as a pleasing aroma to jehovah and the priest will make atonement for him and it will be forgiven him
32  but if he offers a lamb as his sin offering he should bring a sound female lamb
33  he will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered
34  the priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and he will pour all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar
35  he will remove all its fat the same way that the fat of the young ram of the communion sacrifice is removed and the priest will make them smoke on the altar on top of jehovahs offerings made by fire and the priest will make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed and it will be forgiven him
26  you must not make worthless gods for yourselves and you must not set up a carved image or a sacred pillar for yourselves and you must not put a stone figure in your land in order to bow down toward it for i am jehovah your god
2  you should keep my sabbaths and show reverence for my sanctuary
i am jehovah
3  if you continue walking in my statutes and keeping my commandments and you carry them out
4  i will give you showers of rain at their proper time and the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will give their fruit
5  your threshing season will extend until your grape harvest and the grape harvest will extend until the sowing season and you will eat your bread to satisfaction and dwell in security in your land
6  i will put peace in the land and you will lie down with no one making you afraid and i will rid the land of vicious wild animals and a sword of war will not pass through your land
7  you will certainly pursue your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword
8  five of you will pursue 100 and 100 of you will pursue 10000 and your enemies will fall before you by the sword
9  i will direct my favor to you and make you fruitful and multiply you and i will keep my covenant with you
10  while you are still eating the old produce of the preceding year you will need to clear out the old to make way for the new
11  and i will place my tabernacle in your midst and i will not reject you
12  i will walk among you and be your god and you for your part will be my people
13  i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt to be their slaves no longer and i broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk with heads held high
14  however if you will not listen to me or keep all these commandments
15  and if you reject my statutes and if you abhor my judicial decisions so that you do not keep all my commandments and you violate my covenant
16  i for my part will do the following to you i will punish you with distress with tuberculosis and burning fever making your eyes fail and your life waste away
you will sow your seed simply for nothing for your enemies will eat it
17  i will set my face against you and you will be defeated by your enemies and those who hate you will tread on you and you will flee when no one is pursuing you
18  if even this does not make you listen to me i will have to chastise you seven times as much for your sins
19  i will break your stubborn pride and make your heavens like iron and your earth like copper
20  you will exhaust your strength for nothing as your land will not yield its produce and the trees of the land will not produce fruit
21  but if you keep walking in opposition to me and refuse to listen to me i will then have to strike you seven times as much according to your sins
22  i will send the wild animals of the field among you and they will bereave you of children and annihilate your domestic animals and reduce your numbers and your roads will be deserted
23  if in spite of these things you do not accept my correction and you insist on walking in opposition to me
24  then i too will walk in opposition to you and i myself will strike you seven times for your sins
25  i will bring an avenging sword upon you for breaking the covenant
if you gather yourselves into your cities i will send disease into your midst and you will be given into the hand of an enemy
26  when i destroy your supply of bread ten women will be able to bake your bread in only one oven and then ration your bread by weight and you will eat but you will not be satisfied
27  if in spite of this you will not listen to me and you insist on walking in opposition to me
28  i will intensify my opposition to you and i myself will have to chastise you seven times for your sins
29  so you will have to eat the flesh of your sons and you will eat the flesh of your daughters
30  i will annihilate your sacred high places and cut down your incense stands and pile your carcasses on the carcasses of your disgusting idols and i will turn away from you in disgust
31  i will give your cities to the sword and make your sanctuaries desolate and i will not smell the pleasing aromas of your sacrifices
32  i myself will make the land desolate and your enemies who are dwelling in it will stare in amazement over it
33  and i will scatter you among the nations and i will unsheathe a sword after you and your land will be made desolate and your cities will be devastated
34  at that time the land will pay off its sabbaths all the days it lies desolate while you are in the land of your enemies
at that time the land will rest as it must repay its sabbaths
35  all the days it lies desolate it will rest because it did not rest during your sabbaths when you were dwelling on it
36  as for those who survive i will fill their hearts with despair in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a blowing leaf will cause them to flee and they will flee like someone running from the sword and fall without anyone pursuing them
37  they will stumble over one another like those running from a sword though no one is pursuing them
you will not be able to resist your enemies
38  you will perish among the nations and the land of your enemies will consume you
39  those of you who remain will be left to rot in the lands of your enemies because of your error
yes they will rot away because of the errors of their fathers
40  then they will confess their own error and the error and unfaithfulness of their fathers and admit that they behaved unfaithfully by walking in opposition to me
41  then i also walked in opposition to them by bringing them into the land of their enemies
perhaps then their uncircumcised heart will be humbled and then they will pay off their error
42  and i will remember my covenant with jacob and my covenant with isaac and i will remember my covenant with abraham and i will remember the land
43  while the land was abandoned by them it was paying off its sabbaths and lying desolate without them and they were paying for their error because they rejected my judicial decisions and they abhorred my statutes
44  but despite all of this while they are in the land of their enemies i will never completely reject them nor cast them away to the point of exterminating them which would violate my covenant with them for i am jehovah their god
45  for their sakes i will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom i brought out of the land of egypt under the eyes of the nations in order to prove myself their god
i am jehovah
46  these are the regulations the judicial decisions and the laws that jehovah established between himself and the israelites on mount siʹnai through moses
11  then jehovah said to moses and aaron
2  tell the israelites these are the living creatures of the earth that you may eat
3  every animal that has a split hoof and a cleft in its hooves and that chews the cud may be eaten
4  but you must not eat these animals that chew the cud or have a split hoof the camel which chews the cud but does not have a split hoof
it is unclean for you
5  also the rock badger because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof
it is unclean for you
6  also the hare because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof
it is unclean for you
7  also the pig because it has a split hoof and a cleft in the hoof but does not chew the cud
it is unclean for you
8  you must not eat any of their flesh or touch their dead body
they are unclean for you
9  this is what you may eat of everything in the waters anything in the waters that has fins and scales whether in the seas or in the rivers it you may eat
10  but anything in the seas and in the rivers that has no fins and scales among all the swarming creatures and of every other living creature that is in the waters it is a loathsome thing for you
11  yes they should be loathsome to you and you must not eat any of their flesh and you must loathe their carcasses
12  everything in the waters that has no fins and scales is a loathsome thing to you
13  these are the flying creatures that you are to loathe they should not be eaten for they are loathsome the eagle the osprey the black vulture
14  the red kite and every kind of black kite
15  every kind of raven
16  the ostrich the owl the gull every kind of falcon
17  the little owl the cormorant the longeared owl
18  the swan the pelican the vulture
19  the stork every kind of heron the hoopoe and the bat
20  every winged swarming creature that goes on all fours is something loathsome to you
21  of the winged swarming creatures that move on all fours you may eat only those that have jointed legs above their feet for leaping on the ground
22  of these you may eat various kinds of migratory locusts other edible locusts crickets and grasshoppers
23  all other winged swarming creatures with four legs are something loathsome to you
24  by these you would make yourselves unclean
everyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean until the evening
25  anyone carrying any of their dead bodies should wash his garments he will be unclean until the evening
26  any animal that has a split hoof but does not have a cleft and does not chew its cud is unclean to you
everyone touching them will be unclean
27  every living creature that walks on paws among the creatures that walk on all fours is unclean to you
everyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean until the evening
28  the one who carries their dead bodies should wash his garments and he will be unclean until the evening
they are unclean to you
29  these are the swarming creatures of the earth that are unclean to you the mole rat the mouse every kind of lizard
30  the gecko the large lizard the newt the sand lizard and the chameleon
31  these swarming creatures are unclean to you
everyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean until the evening
32  now anything they fall on when they die will be unclean whether a wooden utensil a garment a skin or a piece of sackcloth
any utensil that is used should be immersed in water and it will be unclean until the evening then it will be clean
33  if they fall into an earthenware vessel you are to smash it and anything that was in it will be unclean
34  any kind of food that comes in contact with water from such a vessel will be unclean and any drinkable liquid in such a vessel will be unclean
35  anything their dead bodies fall on will be unclean
whether oven or small stove it should be broken into pieces
they are unclean and they will remain unclean to you
36  only a spring and a cistern for storing water will continue clean but anyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean
37  if their dead bodies fall on a plant seed that is to be sown it is clean
38  but if water is put on a seed and part of their dead body falls on it the seed is unclean to you
39  now if an animal that you use for food dies whoever touches its dead body will be unclean until the evening
40  whoever eats any of its dead body should wash his garments and he will be unclean until the evening
whoever carries off its dead body should wash his garments and he will be unclean until the evening
41  every swarming creature of the earth is something loathsome
it must not be eaten
42  you must not eat any creature that crawls on its belly any creature that goes on all fours or any of earths swarming creatures with a great number of legs for they are something loathsome
43  do not make yourselves loathsome by means of any swarming creature and do not defile yourselves and become unclean by them
44  for i am jehovah your god and you must sanctify yourselves and become holy because i am holy
so you must not make yourselves unclean by any swarming creature that moves on the earth
45  for i am jehovah who is leading you up out of the land of egypt to prove myself god to you and you must be holy because i am holy
46  this is the law about the animals the flying creatures every living creature that moves through the waters and concerning every creature that swarms on the earth
47  in order to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten
8  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
2  take aaron and his sons with him the garments the anointing oil the bull of the sin offering the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread
3  and make all the assembly gather together at the entrance of the tent of meeting
4  then moses did just as jehovah had commanded him and the assembly gathered together at the entrance of the tent of meeting
5  moses now said to the assembly this is what jehovah has commanded us to do
6  so moses brought aaron and his sons near and washed them with water
7  after that he put the robe on him wrapped him with the sash clothed him with the sleeveless coat and put the ephʹod on him and tied it with the woven belt of the ephʹod binding it securely on him
8  next he placed the breastpiece on him and put the uʹrim and the thumʹmim in the breastpiece
9  then he placed the turban on his head and he put on the front of the turban the shining plate of gold the holy sign of dedication just as jehovah had commanded moses
10  moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and sanctified them
11  after that he spattered some of it seven times on the altar and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand in order to sanctify them
12  finally he poured some of the anointing oil on aarons head and anointed him in order to sanctify him
13  moses then brought aarons sons near and clothed them with robes and wrapped them with sashes and put headgear on them just as jehovah had commanded moses
14  then he brought the bull of the sin offering and aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering
15  moses slaughtered it and took the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides and he purified the altar from sin but the rest of the blood he poured at the base of the altar in order to sanctify it to make atonement on it
16  after that he took all the fat that was on the intestines the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and moses made them smoke on the altar
17  then he had the rest of the bull its skin its flesh and its dung burned with fire outside the camp just as jehovah had commanded moses
18  he now brought the ram of the burnt offering near and aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram
19  moses then slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar
20  he cut the ram into its pieces and moses made the head the pieces and the suet smoke
21  he washed the intestines and the shanks with water and moses made the entire ram smoke on the altar
it was a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma
it was an offering made by fire to jehovah just as jehovah had commanded moses
22  then he brought the second ram the ram of the installation and aaron and his sons laid their hands on the rams head
23  moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on aarons right earlobe and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot
24  next moses brought aarons sons forward and put some of the blood on their right earlobe and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot but moses sprinkled the rest of the blood on all sides of the altar
25  then he took the fat the fat tail all the fat that was on the intestines the appendage of the liver the two kidneys and their fat and the right leg
26  he took out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before jehovah one unleavened ringshaped loaf one ringshaped loaf of oiled bread and one wafer
he then placed them on the pieces of fat and the right leg
27  after that he put all of them on the palms of aaron and the palms of his sons and began to wave them back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah
28  then moses took them from their hands and made them smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering
they were an installation sacrifice as a pleasing aroma
it was an offering made by fire to jehovah
29  moses then took the breast and waved it back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah
from the installation ram it became the portion for moses just as jehovah had commanded moses
30  and moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and spattered it on aaron and his garments and on his sons and the garments of his sons who were with him
thus he sanctified aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments
31  then moses said to aaron and his sons boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting and you will eat it there with the bread that is in the installation basket just as i was commanded aaron and his sons will eat it
32  what is left over of the flesh and the bread you will burn with fire
33  you must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days until the days for completing your installation are over because it will take seven days to install you as priests
34  jehovah commanded that we do what we have done today in order to make atonement for you
35  you will stay at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and carry out your obligation to jehovah so that you may not die for so i have been commanded
36  and aaron and his sons did all the things that jehovah had commanded by means of moses
16  jehovah spoke to moses after the death of aarons two sons who died for approaching jehovah
2  jehovah said to moses tell aaron your brother that he may not come at just any time into the holy place inside the curtain in front of the cover on the ark so that he may not die for i will appear over the cover in a cloud
3  this is what aaron should bring when he comes into the holy place a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering
4  he should put on the holy linen robe and the linen shorts should cover his body and he should wrap himself with the linen sash and his head with the linen turban
they are holy garments
he will bathe himself in water and put them on
5  he should take from the assembly of the israelites two young male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering
6  aaron must then present the bull of the sin offering which is for himself and he will make atonement in behalf of himself and his house
7  he will then take the two goats and make them stand before jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting
8  aaron will draw lots over the two goats the one lot for jehovah and the other lot for azaʹzel
9  aaron will present the goat that was designated by lot for jehovah and make it a sin offering
10  but the goat designated by lot for azaʹzel should be brought alive to stand before jehovah in order to perform the atonement upon it so that it may be sent away for azaʹzel into the wilderness
11  aaron will present the bull of the sin offering which is for himself and make atonement in behalf of himself and his house afterward he will slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself
12  he will then take the fire holder full of burning coals from the altar before jehovah and two handfuls of fine perfumed incense and he will bring them inside the curtain
13  he will also put the incense on the fire before jehovah and the cloud of the incense will envelop the ark cover which is on the testimony so that he may not die
14  he will take some of the bulls blood and spatter it with his finger in front of the cover on the east side and he will spatter some of the blood with his finger seven times before the cover
15  he will then slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the people and bring its blood inside the curtain and do with its blood the same as he did with the bulls blood he is to spatter it toward the cover and before the cover
16  he must make atonement for the holy place concerning the acts of uncleanness of the israelites and concerning their transgressions and their sins and that is what he should do for the tent of meeting which is located among them in the midst of their acts of uncleanness
17  no other man should be in the tent of meeting from the time he goes in to make atonement in the holy place until he comes out
he will make atonement in behalf of himself and his house and in behalf of the entire congregation of israel
18  he will then come out to the altar which is before jehovah and make atonement for it and he will take some of the bulls blood and some of the goats blood and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides
19  he will also spatter some of the blood on it with his finger seven times and cleanse it and sanctify it from the acts of uncleanness of the israelites
20  when he has finished making atonement for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar he will also present the live goat
21  aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the errors of the israelites and all their transgressions and all their sins and he will put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man designated to do this
22  the goat will carry upon itself all their errors into a desert land and he will send the goat away into the wilderness
23  aaron will then enter into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments that he put on when he went into the holy place and he will lay them down there
24  he must bathe himself in water in a holy place and put on his garments then he will come out and offer up his burnt offering and the peoples burnt offering and make atonement in his own behalf and in behalf of the people
25  he will make the fat of the sin offering smoke on the altar
26  the man who sent away the goat for azaʹzel should wash his garments and bathe himself in water and after that he may come into the camp
27  and the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering whose blood was brought into the holy place to make atonement will be taken outside the camp and their skins and their flesh and their dung will be burned in the fire
28  the one who burns them should wash his garments and bathe himself in water and after that he may come into the camp
29  it will serve as a lasting statute for you in the seventh month on the tenth of the month you should afflict yourselves and you must not do any work whether a native or a foreigner who is residing among you
30  on this day atonement will be made for you to declare you clean
you will be clean from all your sins before jehovah
31  it is a sabbath of complete rest for you and you should afflict yourselves
it is a lasting statute
32  the priest who is anointed and installed to serve as priest in place of his father will make atonement and put on the linen garments the holy garments
33  he will make atonement for the holy sanctuary the tent of meeting and the altar and he will make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the congregation
34  this will serve as a lasting statute for you to make atonement for the israelites concerning all their sins once each year
so he did just as jehovah had commanded moses
18  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
2  speak to the israelites and say to them i am jehovah your god
3  you must not behave as they do in the land of egypt where you were dwelling and you must not do what they do in the land of caʹnaan where i am bringing you
and you must not walk in their statutes
4  you should carry out my judicial decisions and you should keep my statutes and walk in them
i am jehovah your god
5  you must keep my statutes and my judicial decisions anyone who does so will live by means of them
i am jehovah
6  no man among you should approach any of his close relatives to have sexual relations
i am jehovah
7  you must not have sexual relations with your father and you must not have sexual relations with your mother
she is your mother and you must not have sexual relations with her
8  you must not have sexual relations with your fathers wife
it is exposing your father to shame
9  you must not have sexual relations with your sister either the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother whether she is born in the same household or born outside of it
10  you must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your son or the daughter of your daughter because they are your own nakedness
11  you must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your fathers wife the offspring of your father because she is your sister
12  you must not have sexual relations with your fathers sister
she is your fathers blood relative
13  you must not have sexual relations with your mothers sister because she is your mothers blood relative
14  you must not expose your fathers brother to shame by having sexual relations with his wife
she is your aunt
15  you must not have sexual relations with your daughterinlaw
she is your sons wife and you must not have relations with her
16  you must not have sexual relations with your brothers wife because it is exposing your brother to shame
17  you must not have sexual relations with a woman and her daughter
you must not take the daughter of her son and the daughter of her daughter in order to have relations
they are her close relatives it is an obscene act
18  you must not take a woman in addition to her sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while her sister is alive
19  you must not approach a woman during her menstrual impurity to have sexual relations with her
20  you must not have sexual intercourse with the wife of your fellow man making yourself unclean
21  you must not allow any of your offspring to be offered to moʹlech
you must not profane the name of your god in that way
i am jehovah
22  you must not lie down with a male in the same way that you lie down with a woman
it is a detestable act
23  a man must not have sexual intercourse with an animal to become unclean by it nor should a woman offer herself to an animal to have intercourse with it
it is a violation of what is natural
24  do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things for it is by all these things that the nations that i am driving out from before you have made themselves unclean
25  therefore the land is unclean and i will bring punishment on it for its error and the land will vomit its inhabitants out
26  but you yourselves must keep my statutes and my judicial decisions and you must not do any of these detestable things whether a native or a foreigner who is residing among you
27  for all these detestable things were done by the men who lived in the land before you and now the land is unclean
28  then the land will not have to vomit you out for defiling it in the same way that it will vomit out the nations that were before you
29  if anyone does any of these detestable things all those doing them must be cut off from among their people
30  you must keep your obligation to me by not practicing any of the detestable customs that were carried on before you so that you do not make yourselves unclean by them
i am jehovah your god
17  jehovah went on to say to moses
2  speak to aaron and his sons and all the israelites and say to them this is what jehovah has commanded
3  if any man of the house of israel slaughters a bull or a young ram or a goat in the camp or if he slaughters it outside the camp
4  instead of bringing it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to jehovah before the tabernacle of jehovah bloodguilt will be counted to that man
he has shed blood and that man must be cut off from among his people
5  this is so that the israelites will bring the sacrifices which they now sacrifice in the open field to jehovah to the entrance of the tent of meeting to the priest
they are to sacrifice these as communion sacrifices to jehovah
6  and the priest will sprinkle the blood on jehovahs altar at the entrance of the tent of meeting and make the fat smoke as a pleasing aroma to jehovah
7  so they should no longer offer sacrifices to the goatlike demons with which they are prostituting themselves
this will serve as a lasting statute for you throughout your generations
8  you should say to them any man of the house of israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst who offers up a burnt offering or a sacrifice
9  and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to jehovah must be cut off from his people
10  if any man of the house of israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst eats any sort of blood i will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood and i will cut him off from among his people
11  for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i myself have given it on the altar for you to make atonement for yourselves because it is the blood that makes atonement by means of the life in it
12  that is why i have said to the israelites none of you should eat blood and no foreigner who is residing in your midst should eat blood
13  if one of the israelites or some foreigner who is residing in your midst is hunting and catches a wild animal or a bird that may be eaten he must pour its blood out and cover it with dust
14  for the life of every sort of flesh is its blood because the life is in it
consequently i said to the israelites you must not eat the blood of any sort of flesh because the life of every sort of flesh is its blood
anyone eating it will be cut off
15  if anyone whether a native or a foreigner eats an animal found dead or one torn by a wild animal he must then wash his garments and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening then he will be clean
16  but if he does not wash them and does not bathe himself he will answer for his error
9  on the eighth day moses called aaron and his sons and the elders of israel
2  he said to aaron take for yourself a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering sound ones and present them before jehovah
3  but you will say to the israelites take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a young ram each a year old sound ones for a burnt offering
4  and a bull and a ram for communion sacrifices to sacrifice them before jehovah and a grain offering mixed with oil for today jehovah will appear to you
5  so they took what moses had commanded before the tent of meeting
then the whole assembly came forward and stood before jehovah
6  and moses said this is what jehovah has commanded you to do so that the glory of jehovah may appear to you
7  then moses said to aaron approach the altar and present your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement in your own behalf and in behalf of your house and present the offering of the people and make atonement in their behalf just as jehovah has commanded
8  aaron immediately approached the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering that was for him
9  then aarons sons presented the blood to him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and he poured the rest of the blood at the base of the altar
10  he made the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering smoke on the altar just as jehovah had commanded moses
11  and he burned the flesh and the skin with fire outside the camp
12  then he slaughtered the burnt offering and aarons sons handed him the blood and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar
13  they handed him the pieces of the burnt offering along with the head and he made them smoke on the altar
14  further he washed the intestines and the shanks and made them smoke on the burnt offering on the altar
15  he then presented the offering of the people and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and slaughtered it and made a sin offering with it like the first one
16  and he presented the burnt offering and handled it according to the regular procedure
17  he next presented the grain offering filling his hand with some of it and making it smoke on the altar in addition to the burnt offering of the morning
18  after that he slaughtered the bull and the ram of the communion sacrifice that was for the people
then aarons sons handed him the blood and he sprinkled it around on all sides of the altar
19  as for the pieces of fat of the bull the fat tail of the ram the fat covering the internal organs the kidneys and the appendage of the liver
20  they placed all those pieces of fat on the breasts after which he made the pieces of fat smoke on the altar
21  but the breasts and the right leg aaron waved back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah just as moses had commanded
22  then aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the communion sacrifices
23  finally moses and aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and blessed the people
jehovahs glory now appeared to all the people
24  and fire came out from jehovah and began consuming the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar
when all the people saw it they started shouting and they fell with their faces to the ground
27  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
2  speak to the israelites and tell them if a man makes a special vow to offer the estimated value of a person to jehovah
3  the estimated value of a male from 20 to 60 years old will be 50 shekels of silver by the standard shekel of the holy place
4  but if it is a female the estimated value will be 30 shekels
5  if the age is from 5 to 20 years old the estimated value of the male will be 20 shekels and 10 shekels for the female
6  if the age is from one month up to five years old the estimated value of the male will be five shekels of silver and three shekels of silver for the female
7  if the age is 60 years and over the estimated value will be 15 shekels for the male and 10 shekels for the female
8  but if he is too poor to pay the estimated value the person will stand before the priest and the priest will set a value on him
the priest will make the valuation according to what the one making the vow can afford
9  if the vow involves an animal that is suitable for offering to jehovah whatever may be given to jehovah will become something holy
10  he may not replace it or exchange it with good for bad or with bad for good
but if he should exchange it with one animal for another animal the original and what is exchanged for it will both become holy
11  if it is an unclean animal that may not be presented as an offering to jehovah he will then stand the animal before the priest
12  the priest will then set its value as to whether it is good or bad
the value estimated by the priest will stand
13  but if he ever wants to buy it back he must then give a fifth of it in addition to the estimated value
14  now if a man should sanctify his house as something holy to jehovah the priest will then set its value whether it is good or bad
according to the value that the priest sets that is what it will cost
15  but if the one who sanctifies his house wants to buy it back he must then give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it and it will become his
16  if a man sanctifies to jehovah some of the field that he possesses the value will be estimated in proportion to the seed needed to sow it a hoʹmer of barley seed will be 50 shekels of silver
17  if he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee the estimated value stands
18  if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee the priest will calculate for him the price in proportion to the years that are left until the next year of jubilee and a deduction should be made from the estimated value
19  but if the one who sanctified it should ever buy the field back he must then give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it and it will remain his
20  now if he should not buy the field back and the field is sold to another man it may not be bought back again
21  when the field is released in the jubilee it will become something holy to jehovah as a field that is devoted to him
it will become the property of the priests
22  if a man sanctifies to jehovah a field he purchased that is not part of his hereditary property
23  the priest will calculate for him the amount of the valuation up until the year of jubilee and he will give the estimated value on that day
it is something holy to jehovah
24  in the year of jubilee the field will return to the one he bought it from to the one the land belongs to
25  every value should be estimated by the standard shekel of the holy place
the shekel should amount to 20 geʹrahs
26  however no one should sanctify the firstborn of the animals since it is born as the firstborn for jehovah
whether bull or sheep it already belongs to jehovah
27  if it is among the unclean animals and he redeems it according to the estimated value he should give a fifth of it in addition to it
but if it is not bought back it will be sold according to the estimated value
28  but no devoted thing that a man devotes unconditionally to jehovah from his belongings may be sold or bought back whether from mankind or animals or the field he possesses
every devoted thing is something most holy to jehovah
29  furthermore no condemned person who is set apart for destruction may be redeemed
he should be put to death without fail
30  every tenth part of the land whether from the produce of the field or the fruit of the trees belongs to jehovah
it is something holy to jehovah
31  if a man ever wants to buy any of his tenth part back he should give a fifth of it in addition to it
32  as for every tenth part of the herd and flock everything that passes under the shepherds staff the tenth animal should become something holy to jehovah
33  he should not examine whether it is good or bad neither should he exchange it
but if he would ever try to exchange it both the original and what is exchanged for it should become something holy
it may not be bought back
34  these are the commandments that jehovah gave to moses for the israelites on mount siʹnai
7  this is the law of the guilt offering it is something most holy
2  they will slaughter the guilt offering in the place where they slaughter the burnt offerings and its blood should be sprinkled on all sides of the altar
3  he will present all its fat including the fat tail the fat that covers the intestines
4  and the two kidneys with their fat that is near the loins
he will also remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys
5  the priest will make them smoke on the altar as an offering made by fire to jehovah
it is a guilt offering
6  every male among the priests will eat it and it should be eaten in a holy place
it is something most holy
7  the law regarding the sin offering applies to the guilt offering it belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it
8  when the priest presents the burnt offering for someone the skin of the burnt offering that was presented to the priest will become his
9  every grain offering that is baked in the oven or prepared in the pan or on the griddle belongs to the priest who presents it
it will become his
10  but every grain offering that is mixed with oil or that is dry will be for all of aarons sons each will have an equal share
11  now this is the law of the communion sacrifice that one may present to jehovah
12  if he presents it as an expression of thanksgiving he will present along with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened ringshaped loaves mixed with oil unleavened wafers spread with oil and ringshaped loaves made with fine flour wellmixed and blended with oil
13  he will present his offering along with ringshaped loaves of leavened bread and the thanksgiving sacrifice of his communion sacrifices
14  he is to present from it one of each offering as a sacred portion to jehovah it will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the communion sacrifices
15  the flesh of the thanksgiving sacrifice of his communion sacrifices is to be eaten on the day he offers it
he must not save any of it until morning
16  if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a voluntary offering it is to be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice and what is left of it may also be eaten on the next day
17  but whatever is left of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day is to be burned with fire
18  however if any of the flesh of his communion sacrifice is eaten on the third day the one presenting it will not be accepted with approval
it will not be credited to him it is an offensive thing and the person who eats some of it will answer for his error
19  flesh that touches anything unclean is not to be eaten
it is to be burned with fire
everyone who is clean may eat the clean flesh
20  but any person who is unclean and eats the flesh of the communion sacrifice which is for jehovah that person must be cut off from his people
21  if someone touches anything unclean whether the uncleanness of a man or an unclean animal or any unclean disgusting thing and eats some of the flesh of the communion sacrifice which is for jehovah that person must be cut off from his people
22  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
23  tell the israelites you must not eat any fat of a bull or a young ram or a goat
24  the fat of an animal found dead and the fat of an animal killed by another animal may be used for any other purpose but you must never eat it
25  for whoever eats fat from an animal that he presents as an offering made by fire to jehovah must be cut off from his people
26  you must not eat any blood in any of your dwelling places whether that of birds or that of animals
27  anyone who eats any blood must be cut off from his people
28  jehovah went on to speak to moses saying
29  tell the israelites whoever presents his communion sacrifice to jehovah will bring part of the offering from his communion sacrifice to jehovah
30  he will bring in his own hands the fat along with the breast as an offering made by fire to jehovah and he will wave it back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah
31  the priest will make the fat smoke on the altar but the breast will belong to aaron and his sons
32  you will give the right leg as a sacred portion to the priest from your communion sacrifices
33  the son of aaron who presents the blood of the communion sacrifices and the fat will have the right leg as his portion
34  for i take the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion from the communion sacrifices of the israelites and i give them to aaron the priest and his sons as a lasting regulation for the israelites
35  this was the portion from jehovahs offerings made by fire to be set aside for the priests for aaron and his sons on the day he presented them to serve as priests to jehovah
36  jehovah commanded to give them this portion from the israelites on the day he anointed them
it is a permanent statute for their generations
37  this is the law concerning the burnt offering the grain offering the sin offering the guilt offering the installation sacrifice and the communion sacrifice
38  just as jehovah commanded moses on mount siʹnai in the day he commanded the israelites to present their offerings to jehovah in the wilderness of siʹnai
23  jehovah continued speaking to moses saying
2  speak to the israelites and tell them the seasonal festivals of jehovah that you should proclaim are holy conventions
these are my seasonal festivals
3  six days work may be done but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest a holy convention
you may not do any sort of work
it is to be a sabbath to jehovah wherever you dwell
4  these are the seasonal festivals of jehovah holy conventions that you should proclaim at the times appointed for them
5  in the first month on the 14th day of the month at twilight is the passover to jehovah
6  on the 15th day of this month is the festival of unleavened bread to jehovah
seven days you should eat unleavened bread
7  on the first day you will observe a holy convention
you should not do any hard work
8  but you are to present an offering made by fire to jehovah for seven days
there will be a holy convention on the seventh day
you should not do any hard work
9  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
10  speak to the israelites and tell them when you eventually come into the land that i am giving you and you have reaped its harvest you must bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest
11  and he will wave the sheaf back and forth before jehovah to gain approval for you
the priest should wave it on the day after the sabbath
12  on the day you have the sheaf waved you must offer a sound young ram in its first year as a burnt offering to jehovah
13  its grain offering will be two tenths of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with oil as an offering made by fire to jehovah a pleasing aroma
its drink offering will be a fourth of a hin of wine
14  you must not eat any bread roasted grain or new grain until this day until you bring the offering of your god
it is a lasting statute for all your generations wherever you dwell
15  you are to count seven sabbaths from the day after the sabbath from the day that you bring the sheaf of the wave offering
they should be complete weeks
16  you will count off 50 days until the day after the seventh sabbath and then you should present a new grain offering to jehovah
17  you should bring from your dwelling places two loaves as a wave offering
these should be made of two tenths of an eʹphah of fine flour
they should be baked with leaven as first ripe fruits to jehovah
18  and you should present along with the loaves seven sound male lambs each a year old and one young bull and two rams
they will serve as a burnt offering to jehovah along with the corresponding grain offering and drink offerings as an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to jehovah
19  and you must offer one young goat as a sin offering and two male lambs each a year old as a communion sacrifice
20  the priest will wave them back and forth along with the loaves of the first ripe fruits as a wave offering before jehovah together with the two male lambs
they should serve as something holy to jehovah for the priest
21  on this day you will make a proclamation for a holy convention for yourselves
you may not do any hard work
it is a lasting statute in all your dwelling places for all your generations
22  when you reap the harvest of your land you must not reap the edge of your field completely and you should not pick up what is left from your harvest
you should leave it for the poor and for the foreign resident
i am jehovah your god
23  jehovah went on speaking to moses saying
24  tell the israelites in the seventh month on the first of the month you should observe a complete rest a memorial signaled by a trumpet blast a holy convention
25  you may not do any hard work and you will present an offering made by fire to jehovah
26  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
27  however on the tenth of this seventh month is the day of atonement
you should observe a holy convention and you must afflict yourselves and present an offering made by fire to jehovah
28  you are not to do any sort of work on this particular day because it is a day of atonement to make atonement for you before jehovah your god
29  anyone who will not afflict himself on this day will be cut off from his people
30  and i will destroy from among his people every person who does any sort of work on this day
31  you must not do any sort of work
it is a lasting statute for all your generations wherever you dwell
32  it is a sabbath of complete rest for you and you will afflict yourselves on the ninth of the month in the evening
you should observe your sabbath from evening to evening
33  jehovah continued speaking to moses saying
34  tell the israelites on the 15th day of this seventh month is the festival of booths for seven days to jehovah
35  there is to be a holy convention on the first day and you should not do any hard work
36  seven days you must present an offering made by fire to jehovah
on the eighth day you should observe a holy convention and you should present an offering made by fire to jehovah
it is a solemn assembly
you may not do any hard work
37  these are the seasonal festivals of jehovah that you should proclaim as holy conventions for presenting an offering made by fire to jehovah the burnt offering and the grain offering of the sacrifice and the drink offerings according to the daily schedule
38  these are in addition to what is offered on jehovahs sabbaths and your gifts your vow offerings and your voluntary offerings which you should give to jehovah
39  however on the 15th day of the seventh month when you have gathered the produce of the land you should celebrate the festival of jehovah for seven days
on the first day is a complete rest and on the eighth day is a complete rest
40  on the first day you will take the fruit of majestic trees the fronds of palm trees the branches of leafy trees and poplars of the valley and you will rejoice before jehovah your god for seven days
41  you will celebrate it as a festival to jehovah for seven days in the year
as a lasting statute during all your generations you should celebrate it in the seventh month
42  you should dwell in the booths for seven days
all the natives in israel should dwell in the booths
43  so that your future generations may know that it was in the booths that i made the israelites dwell when i was bringing them out of the land of egypt
i am jehovah your god
44  so moses spoke of the seasonal festivals of jehovah to the israelites
22  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
2  tell aaron and his sons that they should be careful how they handle the holy things of the israelites and not profane my holy name regarding the things they are sanctifying to me
i am jehovah
3  say to them throughout your generations any of your offspring who while he is unclean comes near to the holy things that the israelites sanctify to jehovah that person will be cut off from before me
i am jehovah
4  no man of aarons offspring who has leprosy or a discharge may eat of the holy things until he becomes clean neither the man who touches someone who became unclean by a dead person nor a man who has a seminal emission
5  nor a man who touches an unclean swarming creature or who touches a man who is unclean for any reason and who can make him unclean
6  the person who touches any of these will be unclean until the evening and may not eat any of the holy things but he should bathe himself in water
7  when the sun has set he will be clean and afterward he may eat some of the holy things because it is his food
8  also he should not eat any animal found dead or anything torn by wild animals and become unclean by it
i am jehovah
9  they must keep their obligation to me so that they may not incur sin because of it and have to die for it because they were profaning it
i am jehovah who is sanctifying them
10  no unauthorized person may eat anything holy
no foreign guest of a priest or hired worker may eat anything holy
11  but if a priest should purchase someone with his own money that person may share in eating it
slaves born in his house may also share in eating his food
12  if the daughter of a priest should marry someone who is not a priest she may not eat of the contribution of the holy things
13  but if the daughter of a priest should become a widow or is divorced and she has no offspring and she returns to her fathers house as in her youth she may eat some of her fathers food but no unauthorized person may eat it
14  now if a man eats a holy thing by mistake he must add a fifth of its value and give the holy offering to the priest
15  so they should not profane the holy things of the israelites that they contribute to jehovah
16  and cause themselves to incur punishment for their guilt because of eating their holy things for i am jehovah who is sanctifying them
17  jehovah continued speaking to moses saying
18  speak to aaron and his sons and all the israelites and say to them when an israelite man or a foreign resident in israel presents a burnt offering to jehovah to fulfill his vows or to make a voluntary offering
19  he should present a sound male from the herd the young rams or the goats in order to gain approval
20  you must not present anything with a defect for it will not serve to gain approval for you
21  if a man presents a communion sacrifice to jehovah to pay a vow or as a voluntary offering it should be a sound animal from the herd or the flock in order to gain approval
no defect at all should be in it
22  no offering should be blind have a fracture a cut a wart scabbiness or ringworm you must not present any of these to jehovah or make such an offering on the altar for jehovah
23  you may present a bull or a sheep with a limb that is too long or too short as a voluntary offering but it will not be accepted with approval as a vow offering
24  you must not present to jehovah one having the testicles damaged or crushed or pulled off or cut off and you should not offer such animals in your land
25  and you must not present any of these from the hand of a foreigner as the bread of your god for they are corrupted and defective
they will not be accepted with approval for you
26  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
27  when a bull or a young ram or a goat is born it will continue with its mother for seven days but from the eighth day forward it will be accepted with approval as an offering an offering made by fire to jehovah
28  as for a bull or a sheep you must not slaughter it and its young on the same day
29  if you sacrifice a thanksgiving sacrifice to jehovah you should sacrifice it to gain approval for yourselves
30  it should be eaten on that day
you must not leave any of it until morning
i am jehovah
31  you must keep my commandments and carry them out
i am jehovah
32  you must not profane my holy name and i must be sanctified in the midst of the israelites
i am jehovah who is sanctifying you
33  the one bringing you out of the land of egypt to prove myself god to you
i am jehovah
6  jehovah went on to say to moses
2  if someone sins and behaves unfaithfully toward jehovah by deceiving his neighbor in connection with something entrusted to him or something deposited with him or he robs or defrauds his neighbor
3  or he finds something lost and is deceptive about it and if he swears falsely over any such sin he may commit this is what he should do
4  if he has sinned and is guilty he must return what he stole what he extorted what he took by fraud what was entrusted to him or the lost thing that he found
5  or anything about which he swore falsely and he must make full compensation for it and he will add to it a fifth of its value
he will give it to the owner on the day his guilt is proved
6  and he will bring to the priest as his guilt offering to jehovah a sound ram from the flock according to the assessed value for a guilt offering
7  the priest will make atonement for him before jehovah and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done resulting in his guilt
8  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
9  command aaron and his sons and say this is the law of the burnt offering the burnt offering will remain on the hearth on the altar all night long until the morning and the fire will be kept burning on the altar
10  the priest will clothe himself with his official dress of linen and he will put the linen shorts on over his flesh
then he will remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire had consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar
11  then he will take off his garments and put on other garments and take the ashes to a clean place outside the camp
12  the fire will be kept burning on the altar
it must not go out
the priest must burn wood on it each morning and arrange the burnt offering over it and he will make the fat of the communion sacrifices smoke over it
13  fire will be kept constantly burning on the altar
it must not go out
14  now this is the law of the grain offering you sons of aaron are to present it before jehovah in front of the altar
15  one of them will take a handful from the fine flour of the grain offering and some of its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering and he will make it smoke on the altar as a pleasing aroma for a token offering to jehovah
16  aaron and his sons will eat what is left of it
it will be eaten as unleavened bread in a holy place
they will eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting
17  it should not be baked with anything leavened
i have given it as their share out of my offerings made by fire
it is something most holy like the sin offering and like the guilt offering
18  every male among the sons of aaron will eat it
it is their permanent allowance throughout your generations from jehovahs offerings made by fire
everything that touches them will become holy
19  jehovah spoke again to moses
20  this is the offering that aaron and his sons will present to jehovah on the day he is anointed the tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour as a regular grain offering half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening
21  it will be made with oil on a griddle
you will bring it wellmixed with oil and present it in pieces as a baked product of the grain offering as a pleasing aroma to jehovah
22  the anointed priest who succeeds him from among his sons will make it
it is a lasting regulation as a whole offering it will be made to smoke to jehovah
23  every grain offering of a priest should be a whole offering
it must not be eaten
24  jehovah spoke again to moses and said
25  tell aaron and his sons this is the law of the sin offering in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered the sin offering will also be slaughtered before jehovah
it is a most holy thing
26  the priest who offers it for sin will eat it
it will be eaten in a holy place in the courtyard of the tent of meeting
27  everything that touches its flesh will become holy and when anyone spatters some of its blood on his garment you should wash what was spattered with blood in a holy place
28  the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled is to be shattered
but if it was boiled in a copper vessel then the vessel must be scoured and washed with water
29  every male among the priests will eat it
it is something most holy
30  however no sin offering is to be eaten if some of its blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place
it is to be burned with fire
21  jehovah went on to say to moses talk to the priests aarons sons and say to them no one should defile himself for a dead person among his people
2  but he may do so for a close blood relative for his mother his father his son his daughter his brother
3  and he may defile himself for his sister if she is a virgin who is near to him and has not yet married
4  he may not defile himself and make himself profane for a woman who belongs to a husband of his people
5  they should not make their heads bald or shave off the fringe of their beard or make cuts on their body
6  they should be holy to their god and they should not profane the name of their god for they are presenting jehovahs offerings made by fire the bread of their god and they must be holy
7  they should not marry a prostitute a woman who has been defiled or a woman divorced from her husband because the priest is holy to his god
8  you must sanctify him because he is one presenting the bread of your god
he should be holy to you because i jehovah the one sanctifying you am holy
9  now if the daughter of a priest should profane herself by committing prostitution she is profaning her father
she should be burned in the fire
10  the high priest of his brothers on whose head the anointing oil is poured and who has been installed to wear the priestly garments should not let his head go ungroomed or tear his garments
11  he should not approach any dead person he may not defile himself even for his father or his mother
12  he should not go out from the sanctuary and should not profane the sanctuary of his god for the sign of dedication the anointing oil of his god is upon him
i am jehovah
13  he must take as a wife a woman who is a virgin
14  he may not marry a widow a divorced woman one who has been defiled or a prostitute but he should take a virgin from his people as a wife
15  he should not profane his offspring among his people for i am jehovah who is sanctifying him
16  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
17  tell aaron no man of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect may approach to present the bread of his god
18  if there is any man who has a defect he may not approach a man who is blind or lame or has a disfigured face or one limb too long
19  a man with a fractured foot or a fractured hand
20  a hunchback or a dwarf or a man with an eye defect or eczema or ringworm or damaged testicles
21  no man of the offspring of aaron the priest who has a defect may approach to present jehovahs offerings made by fire
because he has a defect he may not approach to present the bread of his god
22  he may eat the bread of his god from the most holy things and from the holy things
23  however he may not come near the curtain and he may not approach the altar because there is a defect in him and he should not profane my sanctuary for i am jehovah who is sanctifying them
24  so moses spoke to aaron and his sons and all the israelites
25  jehovah spoke further to moses on mount siʹnai saying
2  speak to the israelites and tell them when you eventually come into the land that i am giving you then the land will observe a sabbath to jehovah
3  six years you should sow your field with seed and six years you should prune your vineyard and you will gather the lands produce
4  but in the seventh year there should be a sabbath of complete rest for the land a sabbath to jehovah
you should not sow your field with seed or prune your vineyard
5  you must not reap what grows on its own from the grain left after the harvest and the grapes of your unpruned vine you must not gather
there should be a year of complete rest for the land
6  however you may eat the food that grows in the land during its sabbath you your male and female slaves your hired worker and the foreign settlers who are residing with you may eat it
7  as well as the domestic and the wild animals in your land
everything the land produces may be eaten
8  you will count off seven sabbath years seven times seven years and the days of the seven sabbath years will amount to 49 years
9  you will then sound the horn loudly in the seventh month on the tenth of the month on the day of atonement you should cause the sound of the horn to be heard in all your land
10  you must sanctify the 50th year and proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants
it will become a jubilee for you and each of you will return to his property and each of you should return to his family
11  a jubilee is what that 50th year will become for you
you will not sow seed or reap what grew on its own from leftover grain nor gather the grapes of unpruned vines
12  for it is a jubilee
it is to be holy to you
you may eat only what the land produces by itself
13  in this year of the jubilee each of you should return to his property
14  if you sell anything to your fellow man or if you buy from him do not exploit one another
15  you should buy from your fellow man taking into account the number of the years after the jubilee and he should sell to you according to the remaining years for crops
16  if there are many years remaining he may increase its purchase price and when there are few years left he should reduce its purchase price because he is selling you the number of crops to be produced
17  no one among you should exploit his fellow man and you must be in fear of your god for i am jehovah your god
18  by your carrying out my statutes and keeping my judicial decisions you will dwell in security in the land
19  the land will give its fruitage and you will eat to satisfaction and dwell there in security
20  but if you should say what will we eat in the seventh year if we may not sow seed or gather our crops
21  i will command my blessing for you in the sixth year and the land will yield a crop sufficient for three years
22  then you will sow seed in the eighth year and eat from the old crop until the ninth year
until its crop arrives you will eat from the old
23  the land should not be sold on a permanent basis because the land is mine
for you are foreign residents and settlers from my standpoint
24  throughout the land of your possession you should grant the right of buying back the land
25  if your brother becomes poor and has to sell some of his property a repurchaser who is closely related to him must come and buy back what his brother sold
26  if anyone has no repurchaser but he becomes prosperous and finds the means to repurchase it
27  he should calculate its value for the years since he sold it and refund the difference to the man whom he sold it to
then he may return to his property
28  but if he does not find the means to get it back from him what he sold will remain with the purchaser until the jubilee year and it will revert to him in the jubilee and he will return to his property
29  now if a man should sell a home in a walled city his right of repurchase will also continue until the end of the year from the time of his completing the sale his right of repurchase will be valid a whole year
30  but if it is not bought back by the end of one full year the house within the walled city will become the permanent property of its purchaser throughout his generations
it should not be released in the jubilee
31  however the houses of settlements with no surrounding wall should be considered to be part of the field of the countryside
the right of repurchase should continue for it and it should be released in the jubilee
32  as for the houses of the levites within their cities the levites will have the permanent right to repurchase them
33  when the property of the levites is not bought back the house sold in the city belonging to them will also be released in the jubilee because the houses of the cities of the levites are their property among the israelites
34  moreover the field of pasture ground surrounding their cities may not be sold for it is their permanent possession
35  if your brother who is nearby becomes poor and cannot support himself you must sustain him as you would a foreign resident and a settler so that he may keep alive with you
36  do not take interest or make a profit from him
you must be in fear of your god and your brother will keep alive with you
37  you must not lend him your money on interest or give out your food for profit
38  i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt to give you the land of caʹnaan to prove myself your god
39  if your brother who lives nearby becomes poor and he has to sell himself to you you must not force him to do slave labor
40  he should be treated like a hired worker like a settler
he should serve with you until the jubilee year
41  then he will leave you he and his children with him and return to his family
he should return to the property of his forefathers
42  for they are my slaves whom i brought out of the land of egypt
they should not sell themselves the way a slave is sold
43  you must not treat him cruelly and you must be in fear of your god
44  your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you from them you may buy a male or a female slave
45  also from the sons of the foreign settlers who are residing with you from them and from their families that are born to them in your land you may buy slaves and they will become your possession
46  you may pass them on as an inheritance to your sons after you to inherit as a permanent possession
you may use them as workers but you must not subject your israelite brothers to cruel treatment
47  but if a foreign resident or a settler among you becomes wealthy and your brother has become poor alongside him and must sell himself to the foreign resident or the settler who lives among you or to a member of the family of the foreign resident
48  he will continue to have the right of repurchase after he has sold himself
one of his brothers may buy him back
49  or his uncle or the son of his uncle may buy him back or any close relative one of his family may buy him back
or if he himself has become wealthy he may also buy himself back
50  he should calculate with his purchaser the time from the year he sold himself to him until the jubilee year and the money of his sale will correspond to the number of years
his workdays during that time will be assessed at the rate of a hired worker
51  if there are many years remaining he should pay his repurchase price in proportion to the years that are left
52  but if only a few years remain until the jubilee year he should then calculate for himself and pay his repurchase price in proportion to the years remaining
53  he should continue to serve him year by year as a hired worker and you should see to it that he does not treat him cruelly
54  however if he cannot buy himself back on these terms he will then go free in the year of jubilee he and his children with him
55  for the israelites are my own slaves
they are my slaves whom i brought out of the land of egypt
i am jehovah your god
13  jehovah continued to speak to moses and aaron saying
2  if a man develops on his skin a swelling a scab or a blotch and it could become the disease of leprosy on his skin he must then be brought to aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests
3  the priest will examine the infection on his skin
when the hair in the infection has turned white and the appearance of the infection is deeper than the skin it is the disease of leprosy
the priest will examine it and declare him unclean
4  but if the blotch on his skin is white and its appearance is not deeper than the skin and the hair has not turned white the priest will then quarantine the infected person for seven days
5  the priest will then examine him on the seventh day and if it appears that the infection has stopped and has not spread on the skin the priest will quarantine him for another seven days
6  the priest should examine him again on the seventh day and if the infection has faded and has not spread in the skin the priest will declare him clean it was only a scab
the man will then wash his garments and be clean
7  but if the scab has definitely spread on the skin after he appears before the priest to establish his purification he will then appear again before the priest
8  the priest will examine it and if the scab has spread in the skin the priest will then declare him unclean
it is leprosy
9  if the disease of leprosy develops in a man he must then be brought to the priest
10  and the priest will examine him
if there is a white swelling on the skin and it has turned the hair white and there is an open sore in the swelling
11  it is chronic leprosy on his skin and the priest will declare him unclean
he should not quarantine him for he is unclean
12  now if the leprosy breaks out all over the skin and the leprosy covers the person with the disease from head to foot as far as the priest can see
13  and the priest has examined him and sees that the leprosy has covered all his skin he will then declare the infected person clean
all of it has turned white and he is clean
14  but whenever an open sore appears in it he will be unclean
15  when the priest sees the open sore he will declare him unclean
the open sore is unclean
it is leprosy
16  but if the open sore again turns white he will then come to the priest
17  the priest will examine him and if the infection has turned white the priest will then declare the infected person clean
he is clean
18  if a person develops a boil on his skin and it heals
19  but in the place of the boil a white swelling or a reddishwhite blotch has developed he must then show himself to the priest
20  the priest will examine it and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white the priest will then declare him unclean
it is the disease of leprosy that has broken out in the boil
21  but if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin and appears faded the priest will then quarantine him for seven days
22  and if it has clearly spread on the skin the priest will then declare him unclean
it is a disease
23  but if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread it is only the inflammation from the boil and the priest will declare him clean
24  or if someone has a scar from the fire and the raw flesh of the scar becomes a reddishwhite blotch or a white one
25  the priest will then examine it
if the hair in the blotch has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin it is leprosy that has broken out in the scar and the priest will declare him unclean
it is the disease of leprosy
26  but if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in the blotch and it is not deeper than the skin and it is faded the priest will then quarantine him for seven days
27  the priest will examine him on the seventh day and if it has clearly spread on the skin the priest will then declare him unclean
it is the disease of leprosy
28  but if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread over the skin and it is faded it is only a swelling of the scar and the priest will declare him clean because it is an inflammation of the scar
29  when a man or a woman develops an infection on the head or on the chin
30  the priest will then examine the infection
if it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair is yellow and thin the priest will then declare such one unclean it is an infection of the scalp or the beard
it is leprosy of the head or of the chin
31  but if the priest sees that the infection does not appear to be deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it the priest should quarantine the infected person for seven days
32  the priest will examine the infection on the seventh day and if the infected area has not spread and no yellow hair has developed in it and the appearance of the infected area is not deeper than the skin
33  the person should have himself shaved but he will not have the infected area shaved
then the priest will quarantine the infected person for seven days
34  the priest will again examine the infected area on the seventh day and if the infection of the scalp and beard has not spread on the skin and it does not appear deeper than the skin the priest must then declare him clean and he should wash his garments and be clean
35  but if the infection clearly spreads on the skin after his purification
36  the priest will examine him and if the infection has spread on the skin the priest does not need to look for yellow hair that person is unclean
37  but if the examination shows that the infection has not spread and black hair has grown on it the infection has been healed
he is clean and the priest will declare him clean
38  if a man or a woman develops blotches on the skin and the blotches are white
39  the priest will examine them
if the skin blotches are faded white it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin
that person is clean
40  if a man loses the hair of his head and becomes bald he is clean
41  if he loses the hair on the front of his head and becomes bald there he is clean
42  but if a reddishwhite sore develops on the bald part of his scalp or on his forehead it is leprosy breaking out on his scalp or on his forehead
43  the priest will examine him and if the swelling from the infection is reddishwhite on the bald spot on top of his head or on his forehead and it looks like leprosy on his skin
44  he is a leper
he is unclean and the priest should declare him unclean because of the disease on his head
45  as for the leper who has the disease his garments should be torn and his head should be left ungroomed and he should cover over his mustache and call out unclean unclean
46  he will be unclean the whole time that he has the disease
since he is unclean he should live in isolation
his dwelling place will be outside the camp
47  if the disease of leprosy contaminates a garment whether a woolen or a linen garment
48  either in the warp or in the woof of the linen or of the wool or in a skin or in anything made of skin
49  and the yellowishgreen or reddish stain from the disease contaminates the garment a skin the warp the woof or any article of skin it is a contamination from leprosy and it should be shown to the priest
50  the priest will examine the disease and he must quarantine the disease for seven days
51  when he examines the disease on the seventh day and sees that it has spread in the garment in the warp in the woof or in the skin regardless of what the skin is used for the disease is malignant leprosy and it is unclean
52  he should burn the garment or the warp or the woof in the wool or in the linen or any article of skin in which the disease has developed for it is malignant leprosy
it should be burned in the fire
53  but if the priest examines it and the disease has not spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin
54  the priest will then command that they should wash the contaminated item and he will quarantine it for another seven days
55  the priest will then examine the contaminated item after it has been thoroughly washed
if the appearance of the contamination has not changed even if the disease has not spread it is unclean
you should burn it in the fire because it has been eaten away either from its underside or from its outside
56  but if the priest has examined it and the contaminated part is faded after it has been thoroughly washed he will then tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof
57  however if it still appears in another part of the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin it is spreading and you should burn any contaminated item in the fire
58  but when the contamination disappears from the garment or the warp or the woof or any article of skin that you wash it should then be washed a second time and it will be clean
59  this is the law of the disease of leprosy in a garment of wool or of linen or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin for declaring it clean or unclean
14  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
2  this is to be the law of the leper on the day his purification is established when he is to be brought to the priest
3  the priest will go outside the camp and examine him
if the leper has been cured of the leprosy
4  the priest will command him to bring two live clean birds cedarwood scarlet material and hyssop for his cleansing
5  the priest will command that the one bird be killed in an earthenware vessel over running water
6  but he should take the living bird along with the cedarwood the scarlet material and the hyssop and dip them together in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water
7  then he will spatter it seven times on the one cleansing himself from the leprosy and declare him clean and he will set the living bird free in the open field
8  the one cleansing himself must wash his garments and shave off all his hair and bathe in water and he will be clean
afterward he may come into the camp but he will dwell outside his tent for seven days
9  on the seventh day he should shave off all the hair on his head and his chin and his eyebrows
after he shaves off all his hair he will wash his garments and bathe himself in water and he will be clean
10  on the eighth day he will take two sound young rams one sound female lamb in its first year three tenths of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering and one log measure of oil
11  and the priest who declares him clean will present the man who is cleansing himself along with the offerings before jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting
12  the priest will take the one young ram and offer it as a guilt offering together with the log measure of oil and he will wave them back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah
13  then he will slaughter the young ram in the place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are usually slaughtered in a holy place because like the sin offering the guilt offering belongs to the priest
it is something most holy
14  then the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and the priest will put it on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot
15  and the priest will take some of the log measure of oil and pour it into his own left palm
16  the priest will then dip his right finger into the oil that is in his left palm and spatter some of the oil with his finger seven times before jehovah
17  then the priest will put some of the remaining oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot over the blood of the guilt offering
18  the priest will put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself and the priest will make atonement for him before jehovah
19  the priest will sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one cleansing himself from his impurity and afterward he will slaughter the burnt offering
20  and the priest will offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar and the priest will make atonement for him and he will be clean
21  however if he is poor and does not have enough means he will then take one young ram as a guilt offering for a wave offering in order to make atonement for himself along with one tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering a log measure of oil
22  and two turtledoves or two young pigeons according to his means
the one will serve as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering
23  on the eighth day he will bring them for establishing his purification to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting before jehovah
24  the priest will take the young ram of the guilt offering and the log measure of oil and the priest will wave them back and forth as a wave offering before jehovah
25  he will then slaughter the young ram of the guilt offering and the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot
26  the priest will pour some of the oil into his own left palm
27  and he will then spatter with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before jehovah
28  and the priest will put some of the oil that is in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot on the same places that he put the blood of the guilt offering
29  the priest will then put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself in order to make atonement for him before jehovah
30  he will offer up one of the turtledoves or one of the young pigeons according to his means
31  the one he can afford as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering along with the grain offering and the priest will make atonement for the one cleansing himself before jehovah
32  this is the law for the one in whom the disease of leprosy was but who does not have the means when establishing his purification
33  then jehovah said to moses and aaron
34  when you come into the land of caʹnaan which i am giving you as a possession and i contaminate a house in your land with the disease of leprosy
35  the one to whom the house belongs should then come and tell the priest some kind of contamination has appeared in my house
36  the priest will give orders to clear out the house before he comes to examine the contamination in order that he may not declare everything that is in the house unclean and after that the priest will come in to inspect the house
37  he will examine the affected area and if the walls of the house are contaminated with yellowishgreen or reddish depressions and they appear to be deeper than the wall surface
38  the priest will then go out of the house to the entryway of the house and quarantine the house for seven days
39  then the priest will return on the seventh day and make an inspection
if the contamination has spread in the walls of the house
40  the priest will then give orders and the contaminated stones must be torn out and thrown outside the city into an unclean place
41  then he is to have the inside of the house thoroughly scraped and the plaster and mortar that is removed should be discarded outside the city in an unclean place
42  they will then insert other stones in the place of the stones they removed and he should use different mortar and have the house plastered
43  if though the contamination returns and breaks out in the house after the stones were torn out and the house was scraped and replastered
44  the priest will then go in and inspect it
if the contamination has spread in the house it is malignant leprosy in the house
the house is unclean
45  he will then have the house pulled downits stones its timbers and all the plaster and mortar of the houseand carried outside the city to an unclean place
46  but whoever enters the house any of the days it is quarantined will be unclean until the evening
47  and whoever lies down in the house should wash his garments and whoever eats in the house should wash his garments
48  however if the priest comes and sees that the contamination has not spread in the house after the house was replastered the priest will then declare the house clean because the contamination has been healed
49  in order to purify the house from uncleanness he will take two birds cedarwood scarlet material and hyssop
50  he is to kill the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water
51  then he will take the cedarwood the hyssop the scarlet material and the live bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the running water and he must spatter it toward the house seven times
52  and he will purify the house from uncleanness with the blood of the bird the running water the live bird the cedarwood the hyssop and the scarlet material
53  he will then set the live bird free outside the city in the open field and make atonement for the house and it will be clean
54  this is the law respecting any case of leprosy infection of the scalp or the beard
55  leprosy of the garment or the house
56  and respecting swellings scabs and blotches
57  in order to determine when something is unclean and when something is clean
this is the law about leprosy
19  jehovah spoke further to moses saying
2  speak to the entire assembly of the israelites and tell them you should be holy because i jehovah your god am holy
3  each of you should respect his mother and his father and you should keep my sabbaths
i am jehovah your god
4  do not turn to worthless gods or make for yourselves gods of cast metal
i am jehovah your god
5  now if you offer a communion sacrifice to jehovah you should sacrifice it in such a way that you gain approval for yourselves
6  it should be eaten on the day of your sacrifice and on the next day but what is left over until the third day should be burned in the fire
7  if though any of it is eaten on the third day it is an offensive thing that will not be accepted with approval
8  the one eating it will answer for his error because he has profaned a holy thing of jehovah and that person must be cut off from his people
9  when you reap the harvest of your land you must not reap the edge of your field completely and you must not pick up the gleaning of your harvest
10  also you must not gather the leftovers of your vineyard or pick up the scattered grapes of your vineyard
you should leave them for the poor and the foreign resident
i am jehovah your god
11  you must not steal you must not deceive and you must not deal falsely with one another
12  you must not swear to a lie in my name and thus profane the name of your god
i am jehovah
13  you must not defraud your fellow man and you must not rob
you should not withhold the wages of a hired worker all night until morning
14  you must not curse a deaf man or put an obstacle before a blind man and you must be in fear of your god
i am jehovah
15  you must not be unjust in your judgment
you must not show partiality to the poor or show preference to the rich
with justice you should judge your fellow man
16  you must not go around spreading slander among your people
you must not stand up against the life of your fellow man
i am jehovah
17  you must not hate your brother in your heart
you should by all means reprove your fellow man so that you will not bear sin along with him
18  you must not take vengeance nor hold a grudge against the sons of your people and you must love your fellow man as yourself
i am jehovah
19  you should keep my statutes you must not interbreed two sorts of your domestic animals
you must not sow your field with two sorts of seed and you must not wear a garment made with two sorts of thread mixed together
20  now if a man lies down with a woman and has intercourse with her and she is a servant who is designated for another man but she has not been redeemed or given her freedom there should be a punishment
however they should not be put to death for she was not yet set free
21  he should bring his guilt offering to jehovah to the entrance of the tent of meeting a ram of guilt offering
22  the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before jehovah for the sin that he committed and he will be forgiven for the sin that he committed
23  when you come into the land and you plant any tree for food you must consider its fruitage impure and forbidden
for three years it will be forbidden to you
it must not be eaten
24  but in the fourth year all its fruit will be holy for rejoicing before jehovah
25  then in the fifth year you may eat its fruit in order to add its produce to your harvest
i am jehovah your god
26  you must eat nothing containing blood
you must not look for omens or practice magic
27  you must not shave the hair on the side of your head or disfigure the edges of your beard
28  you must not make cuts in your flesh for a dead person and you must not make tattoo markings on yourselves
i am jehovah
29  do not dishonor your daughter by making her a prostitute so that the land may not commit prostitution and be filled with loose morals
30  you must keep my sabbaths and you must show reverence for my sanctuary
i am jehovah
31  do not turn to the spirit mediums and do not consult fortunetellers so as to become unclean by them
i am jehovah your god
32  before gray hair you should rise up and you must show honor to an older man and you must be in fear of your god
i am jehovah
33  if a foreigner resides with you in your land you must not mistreat him
34  the foreigner who resides with you should become to you like a native among you and you must love him as yourself for you were foreign residents in the land of egypt
i am jehovah your god
35  you must not use dishonest standards in measuring length weight or volume
36  you should use accurate scales accurate weights an accurate dry measure and an accurate liquid measure
i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt
37  so you must keep all my statutes and all my judicial decisions and you must follow them
i am jehovah
24  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
2  command the israelites to bring to you pure beaten olive oil for the lights to keep the lamps lit constantly
3  outside the curtain of the testimony in the tent of meeting aaron should arrange to keep the lamps lit from evening to morning before jehovah constantly
it is a permanent statute for all your generations
4  he should set the lamps in order on the lampstand of pure gold before jehovah constantly
5  you will take fine flour and bake it into 12 ringshaped loaves
two tenths of an eʹphah should go into each loaf
6  you will place them in two sets of layers six to the layer set on the table of pure gold before jehovah
7  you should put pure frankincense on each layer set and it will serve as the bread for a token offering made by fire to jehovah
8  on each sabbath day he should regularly arrange it before jehovah
it is a lasting covenant with the israelites
9  it will become aarons and his sons and they will eat it in a holy place because it is something most holy for him from jehovahs offerings made by fire as a lasting regulation
10  now among the israelites was a son of an israelite woman and an egyptian man and a fight broke out between him and an israelite man in the camp
11  the son of the israelite woman began to abuse the name and to curse it
so they brought him to moses
incidentally his mother was sheloʹmith the daughter of dibʹri of the tribe of dan
12  they placed him in custody until jehovahs decision was made clear to them
13  then jehovah said to moses
14  bring the one who cursed to the outside of the camp and all those who heard him must lay their hands on his head and then the entire assembly must stone him
15  and you should tell the israelites if any man curses his god he will answer for his sin
16  so the abuser of jehovahs name should be put to death without fail
the entire assembly should stone him without fail
the foreign resident should be put to death the same as the native for his abusing the name
17  if a man takes a human life he should be put to death without fail
18  anyone who strikes and kills a domestic animal should make compensation for it life for life
19  if a man injures his fellow man then what he has done should be done to him
20  fracture for fracture eye for eye tooth for tooth the same sort of injury he inflicted should be inflicted on him
21  the man who strikes and kills an animal should make compensation for it but the one who strikes and kills a man should be put to death
22  one judicial decision will apply for you whether a foreign resident or a native because i am jehovah your god
23  moses then spoke to the israelites and they brought the one who uttered the curse to the outside of the camp and they stoned him
thus the israelites did just as jehovah had commanded moses
5  if someone sins because he has heard a public call to testify and he is a witness or has seen or learned about it and he does not report it then he will answer for his error
2  or when a person touches anything unclean whether the dead body of an unclean wild animal an unclean domestic animal or an unclean swarming creature he is unclean and has become guilty even if he does not realize it
3  or in case someone without being aware of it touches human uncleannessanything unclean that may make him uncleanand he comes to know it then he becomes guilty
4  or if someone rashly swears to do somethingwhether it is to do good or to do evil no matter what it may beand he was unaware of it but then he realizes that he has sworn rashly he becomes guilty
5  if he becomes guilty as respects one of these things then he must confess in what way he has sinned
6  he will also bring his guilt offering to jehovah for the sin that he committed namely a female from the flock either a female lamb or a young female goat for a sin offering
then the priest will make atonement for him for his sin
7  if though he cannot afford a sheep he must bring to jehovah two turtledoves or two young pigeons as his guilt offering for the sin one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering
8  he is to bring them to the priest who will present first the one for the sin offering and nip off its head at the front of its neck without severing it
9  he will spatter some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar but the remainder of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar
it is a sin offering
10  he will handle the other one as a burnt offering according to the regular procedure and the priest will make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed and it will be forgiven him
11  now if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons he must bring as his offering for his sin a tenth of an eʹphah of fine flour for a sin offering
he should not add oil to it or place frankincense on it for it is a sin offering
12  he will bring it to the priest and the priest will take from it his handful as a token offering and make it smoke on the altar on top of jehovahs offerings made by fire
it is a sin offering
13  the priest will make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed any one of these sins and it will be forgiven him
the remainder of the offering will become the priests just like the grain offering
14  jehovah continued to speak to moses saying
15  if someone behaves unfaithfully by unintentionally sinning against the holy things of jehovah he is to bring to jehovah a sound ram from the flock as a guilt offering its value in silver shekels is set according to the standard shekel of the holy place
16  and he will make compensation for the sin he has committed against the holy place and he will also add a fifth of its value
he will give it to the priest so that the priest may make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering and it will be forgiven him
17  if someone sins by doing any of the things that jehovah commands should not be done even if he is not aware of it he is still guilty and will answer for his error
18  he should bring to the priest a sound ram from the flock according to the estimated value for a guilt offering
then the priest will make atonement for him for the unintentional mistake that he unknowingly committed and it will be forgiven him
19  it is a guilt offering
he has certainly become guilty of sinning against jehovah
15  jehovah continued to speak to moses and aaron saying
2  speak to the israelites and tell them if a man has a discharge from his genital organ this discharge makes him unclean
3  he is unclean from the discharge whether the discharge continues to flow from his genitals or is obstructed he is still unclean
4  any bed that the one with the discharge lies on will be unclean and anything he sits on will be unclean
5  a man who touches his bed must wash his garments and he should bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
6  anyone who sits on an article that the one having a discharge sat on should wash his garments bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
7  whoever touches the flesh of the one having a discharge should wash his garments bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
8  if the one who has a discharge spits on someone clean that person must wash his garments bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
9  any saddle that the one with the discharge rides on will be unclean
10  anyone touching anything that was under him will be unclean until the evening and anyone who carries those items will wash his garments bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
11  if the one with the discharge has not washed his hands in water and he touches someone that person must then wash his garments bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
12  an earthenware vessel that the one having a discharge touches should be smashed and any wooden vessel should be washed with water
13  when the discharge stops and the person becomes clean from it he will then count seven days for his purification and he must wash his garments bathe himself in running water and he will be clean
14  on the eighth day he should take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest
15  and the priest will offer them the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering and the priest will make atonement for him before jehovah concerning his discharge
16  now if a man has an emission of semen he should bathe his whole body in water and be unclean until the evening
17  he must wash with water any garment and any skin with semen on it and it will be unclean until the evening
18  when a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen they should bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
19  if a woman has a discharge of blood from her body she will continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days
anyone touching her will be unclean until the evening
20  anything she lies down on in her menstrual impurity will be unclean and everything she sits on will be unclean
21  anyone touching her bed should wash his garments bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
22  anyone touching any article she sat on should wash his garments bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
23  if she sat on the bed or on another article his touching it will make him unclean until the evening
24  and if a man lies down with her and her menstrual impurity comes on him he will then be unclean for seven days and any bed on which he lies down will be unclean
25  when a womans discharge of blood flows for many days when it is not the regular time of her menstruation or if she should have a flow longer than her usual menstruation she will be unclean during all the days of her discharge as in the days of her menstrual impurity
26  any bed she lies on during the days of her discharge will become like the bed of her menstrual impurity and any article she sits on will become unclean like the uncleanness of her menstrual impurity
27  anyone touching them will be unclean and he must wash his garments bathe in water and be unclean until the evening
28  however when she is clean from her discharge she will count for herself seven days and afterward she will be clean
29  on the eighth day she should take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and she will bring them to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting
30  the priest will make the one a sin offering and the other a burnt offering and the priest will make atonement for her before jehovah concerning her unclean discharge
31  thus you must keep the israelites separate from their uncleanness so that they do not die in their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle which is in their midst
32  this is the law about the man having a discharge the man who is unclean because of an emission of semen
33  the woman during her menstrual impurity any male or female who has a discharge flowing from the body and a man who lies down with an unclean woman
20  jehovah went on speaking to moses saying
2  you are to say to the israelites any man of israel and any foreigner who resides in israel who gives any of his offspring to moʹlech should be put to death without fail
the people of the land should stone him to death
3  i myself will set my face against that man and i will cut him off from among his people because he has given some of his offspring to moʹlech and has defiled my holy place and has profaned my holy name
4  if the people of the land should deliberately close their eyes to what that man does when he gives his offspring to moʹlech and they do not put him to death
5  then i myself will certainly set my face against that man and his family
i will cut off that man from his people along with all who join him in prostituting themselves to moʹlech
6  as for the person who turns to the spirit mediums and the fortunetellers so as to commit spiritual prostitution with them i will certainly turn against that person and cut him off from his people
7  you must sanctify yourselves and become holy because i am jehovah your god
8  and you must keep my statutes and carry them out
i am jehovah who is sanctifying you
9  if there is any man who curses his father or his mother he should be put to death without fail
since he has cursed his father or his mother his own blood is upon him
10  now regarding a man who commits adultery with another mans wife the one who commits adultery with the wife of his fellow man should be put to death without fail the adulterer and the adulteress
11  a man who lies down with his fathers wife has exposed his father to shame
both of them should be put to death without fail
their own blood is upon them
12  if a man lies down with his daughterinlaw both of them should be put to death without fail
they have violated what is natural
their own blood is upon them
13  if a man lies down with a male the same as one lies down with a woman both of them have done a detestable thing
they should be put to death without fail
their own blood is upon them
14  if a man takes a woman and her mother it is an obscene act
they should burn him and them in the fire so that obscene conduct may not continue among you
15  if a man has intercourse with a beast he should be put to death without fail and you should kill the beast
16  if a woman approaches any beast to have intercourse with it you must kill the woman and the beast
they should be put to death without fail
their own blood is upon them
17  if a man has sexual relations with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother and he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness it is a disgrace
they must be cut off before the eyes of the sons of their people
he has exposed his sister to shame
he should answer for his error
18  if a man lies down with a menstruating woman and has sexual relations with her both he and she have exposed her flow of blood
both of them must be cut off from among their people
19  you must not have sexual relations with your mothers sister or your fathers sister because that would be exposing a blood relative to shame
they should answer for their error
20  a man who lies down with his uncles wife has exposed his uncle to shame
they should answer for their sin
they should die childless
21  if a man takes his brothers wife it is something abhorrent
he has exposed his brother to shame
they should become childless
22  you must keep all my statutes and all my judicial decisions and carry them out so that the land where i am bringing you to dwell will not vomit you out
23  you must not walk in the statutes of the nations that i am driving out from before you for they have done all these things and i abhor them
24  that is why i said to you you will take possession of their land and i will give it to you as your possession a land flowing with milk and honey
jehovah your god i am who has set you apart from the peoples
25  you must make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean and between the unclean bird and the clean you must not make yourselves loathsome by means of an animal or a bird or anything that creeps on the ground that i set apart for you to regard as unclean
26  you must be holy to me because i jehovah am holy and i am setting you apart from the peoples to become mine
27  any man or woman who acts as a spirit medium or is a fortuneteller should be put to death without fail
the people should stone them to death
their own blood is upon them

2  speak to the israelites and tell them if any one of you would present an offering to jehovah from the domestic animals you should present your offering from the herd or from the flock
3  if his offering is a burnt offering from the herd he should present a sound male animal
he should present it of his own free will before jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting
4  he is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering and it will be accepted in his behalf to make atonement for him
5  then the young bull must be slaughtered before jehovah and the sons of aaron the priests will present the blood and sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting
