1  a pronouncement against ninʹeveh the book of the vision of naʹhum the elʹkoshite
2  jehovah is a god who requires exclusive devotion and takes vengeancejehovah takes vengeance and is ready to express his wrath
jehovah takes vengeance against his foesand he stores up wrath for his enemies
3  jehovah is slow to anger and great in powerbut by no means will jehovah hold back due punishment
his path is in destructive wind and stormand the clouds are the dust of his feet
4  he rebukes the sea and he dries it upand he makes all the rivers run dry
baʹshan and carʹmel witherand the blossoms of lebʹanon wither
5  mountains quake because of himand the hills melt
the earth will be in an upheaval because of his facealong with the land and all those dwelling in it
6  who can stand before his indignation and who can withstand the heat of his anger his wrath will be poured out like fireand the rocks will be shattered because of him
7  jehovah is good a stronghold in the day of distress
he is mindful of those seeking refuge in him
8  with a sweeping flood he will make a complete extermination of her placeand darkness will pursue his enemies
9  what will you plot against jehovah he is causing a complete extermination
distress will not arise a second time
10  for they are interwoven like thornsand they are like those drunk with beerbut they will be consumed like dry stubble
11  from you will come one who plots evil against jehovahgiving worthless advice
12  this is what jehovah says though they were at full strength and numerouseven so they will be cut down and will pass away
i have afflicted you but i will afflict you no more
13  and now i will break his yoke bar from off youand i will tear your bonds in two
14  jehovah has commanded concerning youyour name will not be perpetuated further
i will do away with the carved images and metal statues from the house of your gods
i will make a grave for you because you are contemptible
15  look on the mountains are the feet of one bringing good newsthe one proclaiming peace
celebrate your festivals o judah pay your vowsfor the worthless one will never pass through you again
he will be utterly destroyed
2  one who scatters has come up against you
guard the fortifications
keep watch over the road
brace yourselves and muster all your strength
2  for jehovah will restore the pride of jacobalong with the pride of israelfor the devastators have devastated themand they have ruined their shoots
3  the shields of his mighty men are dyed redhis warriors are dressed in crimson
the iron fittings of his war chariots flash like firein the day he prepares for battleand the juniper spears are brandished
4  the war chariots race madly through the streets
they rush up and down the public squares
they shine like burning torches and flash like lightning
5  he will summon his officers
they will stumble as they advance
they rush to her wallthey set up the barricade
6  the gates of the rivers will be openedand the palace will be dissolved
7  it has been decreed she is exposedshe is carried away and her slave girls moanthey sound like doves as they beat their breasts
8  throughout her days ninʹeveh was like a pool of watersbut now they are fleeing
stand still stand still but no one is turning back
9  plunder silver plunder gold there is no end to the treasures
it is stocked with all sorts of precious things
10  the city is empty desolate devastated their hearts melt in fear their knees buckle their hips trembleall their faces are flushed
11  where is the lair of lions where the young lions feedwhere the lion goes out leading its cubwith no one to make them afraid
12  the lion tore apart enough prey for his cubsand strangled for his lionesses
he kept his dens filled with preyhis lairs with torn animals
13  look i am against you declares jehovah of armiesi will burn up her war chariots in smokeand the sword will devour your young lions
i will cut off your prey from the earthand the sound of your messengers will be heard no more
3  woe to the city of bloodshed she is completely full of deception and robbery
she is never without prey
2  there is the crack of the whip and the rattle of wheelsthe dashing horse and the bounding chariot
3  the mounted horseman the flashing sword and the glittering spearthe multitude of the slain and the heaps of carcassesthere is no end to the dead bodies
they keep stumbling over the dead bodies
4  this is because of the many acts of prostitution of the prostituteshe who is attractive and charming a mistress of sorcerieswho ensnares nations by her prostitution and families by her sorceries
5  look i am against you declares jehovah of armiesi will lift your skirts up over your facei will cause nations to see your nakednessand kingdoms your disgrace
6  and i will throw filth on youand make you despicablei will make a spectacle of you
7  everyone who sees you will flee from you and sayninʹeveh has been devastated who will sympathize with her where will i find comforters for you
8  are you better than noaʹmon which sat by the nile canals waters surrounded herher wealth was the sea and her wall was the sea
9  ethioʹpia was her source of boundless strength also egypt
put and the libʹyans were your helpers
10  but even she became an exileshe went into captivity
her children also were dashed to pieces on every street corner
they cast lots over her honored menand all her great men have been bound with fetters
11  you will also become drunkyou will go into hiding
you will seek refuge from the enemy
12  all your fortifications are like fig trees with the first ripe fruitsif they are shaken they will fall into the mouth of devourers
13  look your troops are like women in your midst
the gates of your land will be wide open for your enemies
fire will consume the bars of your gates
14  draw water for the siege strengthen your fortifications
go down into the mire and tread the claygrab hold of the brick mold
15  even there fire will consume you
a sword will cut you down
it will devour you as the young locusts do
make yourself as numerous as the young locusts yes make yourself as numerous as the locusts
16  you have multiplied your merchants more than the stars of the heavens
the young locust strips off its skin and flies away
17  your guards are like the locustand your officers like a locust swarm
they camp in the stone pens on a cold daybut when the sun shines they fly awayand no one knows where they are
18  your shepherds are drowsy o king of assyrʹiayour nobles stay in their residences
your people are scattered on the mountainsand no one is gathering them together
19  there is no relief for your catastrophe
your wound is beyond healing
all those hearing the report about you will clap their handsfor who has not suffered from your relentless cruelty
