1  the older man to the chosen lady and to her children whom i truly love and not only i but also all those who have come to know the truth
2  because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever
3  there will be with us undeserved kindness mercy and peace from god the father and from jesus christ the son of the father with truth and love
4  i rejoice very much because i have found some of your children walking in the truth just as we received commandment from the father
5  so now i request you lady that we love one another
i am writing you not a new commandment but one that we had from the beginning
6  and this is what love means that we go on walking according to his commandments
this is the commandment just as you have heard from the beginning that you should go on walking in it
7  for many deceivers have gone out into the world those not acknowledging jesus christ as coming in the flesh
this is the deceiver and the antichrist
8  look out for yourselves so that you do not lose the things we have worked to produce but that you may obtain a full reward
9  everyone who pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the christ does not have god
the one who does remain in this teaching is the one who has both the father and the son
10  if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him
11  for the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works
12  although i have many things to write to you i do not want to do so with paper and ink but i am hoping to come to you and to speak with you facetoface so that your joy may be in full measure
13  the children of your sister the chosen one send you their greetings
