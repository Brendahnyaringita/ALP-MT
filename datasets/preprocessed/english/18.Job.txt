10  i loathe my life
i will give vent to my complaints
i will speak out in my bitter distress
2  i will say to god do not pronounce me guilty
tell me why you are contending with me
3  does it benefit you to oppressto despise the work of your handswhile you favor the advice of the wicked
4  do you have eyes of fleshor do you see as mortal man does
5  are your days like the days of mortalsor are your years like those of a man
6  that you should search out my errorand keep looking for my sin
7  you know that i am not guiltyand no one can save me from your hand
8  your own hands have shaped me and made mebut now you would completely destroy me
9  remember please that you made me out of claybut now you make me return to dust
10  did you not pour me out like milkand curdle me like cheese
11  with skin and flesh you clothed meand with bones and sinews you wove me together
12  you have given me life and loyal loveyou have guarded my spirit with your care
13  but you secretly intended to do these things
i know that these things are from you
14  if i sinned you would watch meand you would not acquit me of my error
15  if i am guilty too bad for me and even if i am innocent i cannot raise my headfor i am filled with dishonor and affliction
16  if i raise my head up you hunt for me like a lionand again show your power against me
17  you bring new witnesses against meand increase your anger against meas hardship after hardship comes upon me
18  so why did you bring me out from the womb i should have died before any eye could see me
19  it would have been as though i never existedi would have been taken straight from the womb to the grave
20  are not my days few let him leave me alonelet him turn his eyes away from me so that i may find some relief
21  before i go awayand i will not returnto the land of deepest darkness
22  to the land of utter glooma land of deep shadow and disorderwhere even the light is like the gloom
4  elʹiphaz the teʹmanite then said in reply
2  if someone tries to speak to you will you become impatient for who can hold back from speaking
3  true you have corrected manyand you used to strengthen the weak hands
4  your words would raise up anyone stumblingand you would strengthen those whose knees were buckling
5  but now it has happened to you and you are overwhelmedit touches you and you are dismayed
6  does your reverence for god not give you confidence does your way of integrity not give you hope
7  remember please what innocent person has ever perished when have the upright ever been destroyed
8  what i have seen is that those who plow what is harmfuland those who sow trouble will reap the same
9  by the breath of god they perishand through a blast of his anger they come to an end
10  the lion roars and a young lion growlsbut even the teeth of strong lions are broken
11  a lion perishes for lack of preyand the cubs of a lion are scattered
12  now a word was brought to me in secretand a whisper of it reached my ear
13  in troubling thoughts during visions of the nightwhen deep sleep falls upon men
14  a terrible trembling came upon mefilling all my bones with dread
15  a spirit passed over my facethe hair of my flesh bristled
16  it then stood stillbut i did not recognize its appearance
a form was in front of my eyesthere was a calm and then i heard a voice
17  can a mortal man be more righteous than god can a man be cleaner than his own maker
18  look he has no faith in his servantsand he finds fault with his angels
19  how much more so with those dwelling in houses of claywhose foundation is in the dustwho are crushed as easily as a moth
20  they are completely crushed from morning to eveningthey perish forever and no one takes notice
21  are they not like a tent whose cord is pulled out they die without wisdom
26  job said in reply
2  how you have helped the one with no power how you have saved the arm that has no strength
3  what great advice you have given to the one lacking wisdom how freely you have revealed your practical wisdom
4  to whom are you trying to speakand who inspired you to say such things
5  those who are powerless in death tremblethey are even lower than the waters and their inhabitants
6  the grave is naked in front of godand the place of destruction lies uncovered
7  he stretches out the northern sky over empty spacesuspending the earth upon nothing
8  he wraps up the waters in his cloudsso that the clouds do not burst under their weight
9  he shuts off the view of his thronespreading out his cloud over it
10  he marks out the horizon on the surface of the watershe makes a boundary between light and darkness
11  the very pillars of heaven shakethey are stunned by his rebuke
12  he stirs up the sea with his powerand by his understanding he breaks the sea monster to pieces
13  with his breath he makes the skies clearhis hand pierces the elusive serpent
14  look these are just the fringes of his waysonly a faint whisper has been heard of him so who can understand his mighty thunder
11  zoʹphar the naʹamathite said in reply
2  will all these words go unansweredor will a lot of talking make someone right
3  will your empty talk silence people will no one rebuke you for your mocking words
4  for you say my teaching is pureand i am clean in your eyes
5  but if only god would speakand open his lips to you
6  then he would reveal to you the secrets of wisdomfor practical wisdom has many sides
then you would realize that god allows some of your error to be forgotten
7  can you discover the deep things of godor discover everything about the almighty
8  it is higher than heaven
what can you accomplish it is deeper than the grave
what can you know
9  it is longer than the earthand broader than the sea
10  if he passes by and detains someone and convenes a courtwho can resist him
11  for he knows when men are deceitful
when he sees what is evil will he not take notice
12  but an emptyheaded man will understandonly when a wild donkey can give birth to a man
13  if only you would prepare your heartand stretch out your hands to him
14  if your hand is doing wrong put it far awayand let no unrighteousness dwell in your tents
15  for then you could lift up your face with no defectyou could stand firm free of fear
16  for then you will forget your troubleyou will remember it as waters that have flowed past you
17  your life will become brighter than middayeven its darkness will be like the morning
18  you will be confident because there is hopeand you will look around and lie down in security
19  you will lie down with no one to make you afraidand many people will seek your favor
20  but the eyes of the wicked will failand they will find no place to escapeand their only hope will be death
8  bilʹdad the shuʹhite then said in reply
2  how long will you keep speaking like this the words of your mouth are but a mighty wind
3  will god pervert justiceor will the almighty pervert righteousness
4  if your sons sinned against himhe let them be punished for their revolt
5  but if you would just look to godand plead with the almighty for favor
6  and if you were truly pure and uprighthe would pay attention to youand restore you to your rightful place
7  and though your beginning was smallyour future would be great
8  ask please the former generationand pay attention to the things their fathers found out
9  for we were born only yesterday and we know nothingbecause our days on earth are a shadow
10  will they not instruct youand tell you what they know
11  will a papyrus plant grow tall where there is no marsh will a reed grow tall without water
12  while it is still in the bud not yet plucked offit will dry up before any other plant
13  this is the outcome of all who forget godfor the hope of the godless will perish
14  whose confidence is in vainand whose trust is as fragile as a spiders web
15  he will lean against his house but it will not keep standinghe will try to hold on to it but it will not last
16  he is a moist plant in the sunlightand his shoots spread out in the garden
17  in a heap of stones his roots become entwinedhe looks for a house among the stones
18  but when he is uprooted from his placethat place will deny him and say i have never seen you
19  yes that is how he will disappearthen others will spring up from the dust
20  surely god will not reject those who keep integritynor will he support evil men
21  for he will yet fill your mouth with laughterand your lips with shouts of joy
22  those hating you will be clothed with shameand the tent of wicked ones will be no more
30  now they laugh at memen younger than i amwhose fathers i would have refusedto put with the dogs that guarded my flock
2  of what use was the power of their hands to me their vigor has perished
3  they are worn out from want and hungerthey gnaw at the parched groundthat was already ruined and desolated
4  they gather the salt herb from the bushestheir food is the root of broom trees
5  they are driven out of the communitypeople shout at them as they would at a thief
6  they live on the slopes of ravinesin holes in the ground and in the rocks
7  from the bushes they cry outand huddle together among the nettles
8  as sons of the senseless and the nameless onesthey have been driven out of the land
9  but now they mock me even in their songsi have become an object of scorn to them
10  they detest me and keep their distance from methey do not hesitate to spit in my face
11  because god has disarmed me and humbled methey throw off all restraint in my presence
12  on my right they rise up like a mobthey put me to flightand put up barriers of destruction in my path
13  they tear up my roadwaysand make my calamity worsewithout anyone to stop them
14  they come as if through a wide breach in the wallthey roll in amid the devastation
15  terror overwhelms memy dignity is driven away like the windand my salvation vanishes like a cloud
16  now my life ebbs from medays of affliction take hold of me
17  aching pierces my bones at nightthe gnawing pain never stops
18  with great force my garment is disfiguredlike the collar of my garment it chokes me
19  god has thrown me down into the mudi am reduced to dust and ashes
20  i cry to you for help but you do not answer mei stand up but you just look at me
21  you have cruelly turned against mewith the full might of your hand you assault me
22  you pick me up and carry me off with the windthen you toss me about in the storm
23  for i know that you will bring me down to deathto the house where everyone living will meet
24  but no one would strike at a broken manas he cries for help during his time of disaster
25  have i not wept for those who have fallen on hard times have i not grieved for the poor
26  although i hoped for good bad camei expected the light but darkness came
27  the churning inside me did not stopdays of affliction confronted me
28  i walk about gloomy there is no sunlight
in the assembly i rise and cry for help
29  i have become a brother to jackalsand a companion to the daughters of the ostrich
30  my skin has blackened and fallen offmy bones burn from the heat
31  my harp is used only for mourningand my flute for the sound of weeping
16  job said in reply
2  i have heard many things like these before
all of you are troublesome comforters
3  is there an end to empty words what provokes you to answer this way
4  i could also speak as you do
if you were in my placei could make persuasive speeches against youand shake my head at you
5  instead though i would strengthen you with the words of my mouthand the consolation of my lips would bring relief
6  if i speak my own pain is not relievedand if i stop speaking how much is my pain reduced
7  but now he has made me wearyhe has devastated my whole household
8  you also seize me and it has become a witnessso that my own skinniness rises up and testifies to my face
9  his anger has torn me to pieces and he harbors animosity against me
he grinds his teeth against me
my adversary pierces me with his eyes
10  they have opened their mouth wide against meand they have scornfully struck my cheeksin large numbers they gather against me
11  god hands me over to young boysand he thrusts me into the hands of the wicked
12  i was untroubled but he shattered mehe grabbed me by the back of the neck and crushed methen he set me up as his target
13  his archers surround mehe pierces my kidneys and feels no compassionhe pours out my gall on the earth
14  he breaks through against me with breach after breachhe rushes at me like a warrior
15  i have sewn sackcloth together to cover my skinand i have buried my dignity in the dust
16  my face is red from weepingand on my eyelids is deep shadow
17  although my hands have done no violenceand my prayer is pure
18  o earth do not cover my blood and let there be no restingplace for my outcry
19  even now my witness is in the heavensthe one who can testify for me is in the heights
20  my companions ridicule meas my eye sheds tears to god
21  let someone arbitrate between a man and godas one would between a man and his fellow
22  for the years to come are fewand i will go away on the path of no return
35  eliʹhu continued his response
2  are you so convinced that you are right that you would sayi am more righteous than god
3  for you say what does it matter to you am i better off than if i had sinned
4  i will reply to youand to your companions with you
5  look up to heaven and seeobserve the clouds which are high above you
6  if you sin how do you hurt him if your transgressions multiply what do you do to him
7  if you are righteous what do you give himwhat does he receive from you
8  your wickedness affects only a human like yourselfand your righteousness a son of man
9  people cry out when under great oppressionthey cry for relief from the domination of the powerful
10  but no one says where is god my grand makerthe one causing songs to be sung in the night
11  he teaches us more than the beasts of the earthand he makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens
12  people cry out but he does not answerbecause of the pride of the wicked
13  surely god does not hear an empty crythe almighty does not pay attention to it
14  how much less then when you complain that you do not see him your legal case is before him so you should wait anxiously for him
15  for he has not angrily called for an accountingnor has he taken note of your extreme rashness
16  job opens his mouth wide in vainhe multiplies words without knowledge
18  bilʹdad the shuʹhite said in reply
2  how long before you stop making such speeches show some understanding so that we may then speak
3  why should we be viewed as animalsand be considered stupid in your eyes
4  even if you tear yourself to pieces in your angerwill the earth be abandoned for your sakeor will the rock move away from its place
5  yes the light of the wicked will be extinguishedand the flame of his fire will not shine
6  the light in his tent will certainly grow darkand the lamp over him will be extinguished
7  his vigorous stride is shortenedand his own counsel will make him fall
8  for his feet will lead him into a netand he will wander onto its mesh
9  a trap will seize him by the heela snare will catch him
10  a rope is hidden for him on the groundand a trap lies in his path
11  terrors frighten him on all sidesand chase him at his feet
12  his strength fails himand disaster will make him stagger
13  his skin is eaten awaythe most deadly disease consumes his limbs
14  he is torn away from the security of his tentand marched to the king of terrors
15  strangers will live in his tentsulfur will be scattered on his home
16  his roots will dry up beneath himand his branches will wither above him
17  the memory of him will fade from the earthand in the street his name will be unknown
18  he will be driven from the light into the darknessand chased away from the productive land
19  he will have no offspring and no descendants among his peopleand he will be without a survivor in the place where he lives
20  when his day comes the people in the west will be appalledand the people in the east will be seized with horror
21  this is what happens to the tents of a wrongdoerand to the place of the one who has not known god
17  my spirit has been broken my days have been extinguishedthe graveyard awaits me
2  mockers surround meand my eye must gaze at their rebellious behavior
3  please accept my security and keep it with you
who else will shake hands with me and pledge in my behalf
4  for you have concealed discernment from their heartthat is why you do not exalt them
5  he may offer to share with his friendswhile the eyes of his children fail
6  he has made me an object of scorn among the peoplesso that i became one in whose face they spit
7  from anguish my eyes grow dimand all my limbs are but a shadow
8  upright people stare in amazement at thisand the innocent one is disturbed over the godless
9  the righteous one keeps holding fast to his wayand the one with clean hands grows stronger
10  however you may all come and resume your arguingfor i have not found anyone wise among you
11  my days are finishedmy plans the desires of my heart have been shattered
12  they keep turning night into daysaying light must be near because it is dark
13  if i wait the grave will become my homei will spread out my bed in darkness
14  i will call out to the pit you are my father to the maggot my mother and my sister
15  where then is my hope who can see hope for me
16  it will go down to the barred gates of the gravewhen we all descend together into the dust
9  job said in reply
2  for a fact i know that this is so
but how can mortal man be in the right in a case with god
3  if someone wishes to argue with himthat one could not answer one of his questions in a thousand
4  he is wise in heart and mighty in power
who can resist him and come off uninjured
5  he moves mountains without anyone knowing ithe overturns them in his anger
6  he shakes the earth out of its placeso that its pillars tremble
7  he commands the sun not to shineand seals off the light of the stars
8  he spreads out the heavens by himselfand he treads upon the high waves of the sea
9  he made the ash the keʹsil and the kiʹmah constellationsand the constellations of the southern sky
10  he does great and unsearchable thingswonderful things that cannot be counted
11  he passes by me and i cannot see himhe moves past me but i do not discern him
12  when he snatches something who can resist him who can say to him what are you doing
13  god will not restrain his angereven the helpers of raʹhab will bow down to him
14  how much more when i answer himmust i choose my words carefully to argue with him
15  even if i were in the right i would not answer him
i could only plead for mercy from my judge
16  if i call out to him will he answer me i do not believe that he will listen to my voice
17  for he crushes me with a stormand multiplies my wounds for no reason
18  he does not let me catch my breathhe keeps filling me with bitter things
19  if it is a matter of power he is the strong one
if it is a matter of justice he says who can call me to account
20  if i were in the right my own mouth would condemn meeven if i keep my integrity he will declare me guilty
21  even if i keep my integrity i am not confident about myselfi reject this life of mine
22  it is all the same
that is why i sayhe destroys the innocent and the wicked alike
23  if a flash flood should cause sudden deathhe would mock at the despair of the innocent
24  the earth has been handed over to the wickedhe covers the eyes of its judges
if it is not he then who is it
25  now my days are swifter than a runnerthey run away without seeing good
26  they glide by like reed boatslike eagles that swoop down on their prey
27  if i say i will forget my complainti will change my expression and be cheerful
28  i would still be afraid because of all my painsand i know you would not find me innocent
29  i would be found guilty
so why should i struggle in vain
30  if i wash myself in water from melting snowand i cleanse my hands in lye
31  then you would dip me in a pitso that even my own garments would detest me
32  for he is not a man like me that i may answer himthat we should go to court together
33  there is no person to decide between uswho could serve as our judge
34  if he would stop beating meand not let his terror frighten me
35  then i would speak to him unafraidfor it is not in me to speak out of fear
28  there is a place to mine silverand a place for gold that they refine
2  iron is taken from the groundand copper is smelted from rocks
3  man conquers the darknesshe probes to the limit in the gloom and darknesssearching for ore
4  he sinks a shaft far from where people residein forgotten places far from where people walksome men descend and swing suspended
5  food grows on top of the earthbut below there is an upheaval as if by fire
6  there in the stones is sapphireand the dust contains gold
7  no bird of prey knows the path to itthe eye of a black kite has not seen it
8  no majestic beasts have trodden on itthe young lion has not prowled there
9  man strikes the flinty rock with his handhe overturns the mountains at their foundation
10  he cuts water channels in the rockhis eyes spot every precious thing
11  he dams up the sources of riversand brings what was hidden to the light
12  but wisdomwhere can it be foundand where is the source of understanding
13  no man recognizes its valueand it cannot be found in the land of the living
14  the deep waters say it is not in me and the sea says it is not with me
15  it cannot be bought with pure goldnor can silver be weighed out in exchange for it
16  it cannot be bought with gold of oʹphirnor with rare onyx and sapphire
17  gold and glass cannot be compared to itnor can a vessel of fine gold be exchanged for it
18  coral and crystal are not worthy of mentionfor a bagful of wisdom is worth more than one full of pearls
19  the topaz of cush cannot be compared to itit cannot be purchased even with pure gold
20  but from where does wisdom comeand where is the source of understanding
21  it has been hidden from the eyes of every living thingand concealed from the birds of the heavens
22  destruction and death sayour ears have heard only a report of it
23  god understands the way to find ithe alone knows where it resides
24  for he looks to the ends of the earthand he sees everything under the heavens
25  when he set the force of the windand measured out the waters
26  when he made a regulation for the rainand a path for the thunderous storm cloud
27  then he saw wisdom and explained ithe established and tested it
28  and he said to man look the fear of jehovahthat is wisdomand to turn away from bad is understanding
27  job continued his discourse saying
2  as surely as god lives who has deprived me of justiceas the almighty lives who has made me bitter
3  as long as my breath is within meand spirit from god is in my nostrils
4  my lips will not speak unrighteousnessnor will my tongue mutter deceit
5  it is unthinkable for me to declare you men righteous until i die i will not renounce my integrity
6  i will maintain my righteousness and never let it gomy heart will not condemn me as long as i live
7  may my enemy become like the wickedthose assaulting me like the unrighteous
8  for what hope does the godless man have when he is destroyedwhen god takes away his life
9  will god hear his outcrywhen distress comes upon him
10  or will he find delight in the almighty will he call on god at all times
11  i will teach you about the power of godi will not hide anything about the almighty
12  look if you have all seen visionswhy are your speeches completely empty
13  this is the wicked mans share from godthe inheritance that tyrants receive from the almighty
14  if his sons become many they will fall by the swordand his descendants will not have enough food
15  those who survive him will be buried by the plagueand their widows will not weep for them
16  even if he piles up silver like the dustand stores up fine clothing like the clay
17  though he may gather itthe righteous man will wear itand the innocent will divide up his silver
18  the house he builds is as fragile as a moths cocoonlike a shelter made by a watchman
19  he will go to bed rich but will gather nothingwhen he opens his eyes nothing will be there
20  terror overtakes him like a flooda storm snatches him away by night
21  an east wind will carry him off and he will be goneit sweeps him away from his place
22  it will hurl itself at him without pityas he desperately tries to flee from its force
23  it claps its hands at himand whistles at him from its place
7  is not the life of mortal man on earth like compulsory laborand are not his days like those of a hired worker
2  like a slave he longs for the shadowand like a hired worker he waits for his wages
3  thus i have been assigned months of futilityand nights of misery have been counted out for me
4  when i lie down i ask when will i get up but as the night drags on i toss restlessly until the dawning of the day
5  my flesh is covered with maggots and clods of dirtmy skin is full of scabs and pus
6  my days go by more quickly than a weavers shuttleand they come to an end without hope
7  remember that my life is windthat my eye will never again see happiness
8  the eye that sees me now will see me no moreyour eyes will look for me but i will be gone
9  like a cloud that fades and vanishesthe one who goes down to the grave does not come back up
10  he will not return again to his houseand his place will acknowledge him no more
11  therefore i will not restrain my mouth
i will speak in the anguish of my spiriti will complain in my bitter distress
12  am i the sea or a sea monsterthat you should set a guard over me
13  when i say my couch will comfort memy bed will help ease my misery
14  then you terrify me with dreamsand frighten me with visions
15  so that i would choose suffocationyes death rather than this body of mine
16  i loathe my life i do not want to go on living
leave me alone for my days are like a breath
17  what is mortal man that you should concern yourself with himand fix your attention on him
18  why do you inspect him every morningand test him every moment
19  will you not look away from meand leave me alone long enough to swallow my saliva
20  if i have sinned how could i harm you the observer of mankind why have you made me your target have i become a burden to you
21  why do you not pardon my transgressionand excuse my error for soon i will lie down in the dustand you will look for me but i will be gone
34  so eliʹhu continued to say in reply
2  listen to my words you who are wisehear me you who know so much
3  for the ear tests wordsjust as the tongue tastes food
4  let us evaluate for ourselves what is rightlet us decide among ourselves what is good
5  for job has said i am in the rightbut god has denied me justice
6  would i lie about what my own judgment should be my wound is incurable though there is no transgression
7  what other man is like jobwho drinks up derision like water
8  he is in company with wrongdoersand in association with wicked men
9  for he has said a man does not benefitfrom trying to please god
10  so listen to me you men of understanding it is unthinkable for the true god to act wickedlyfor the almighty to do wrong
11  for he will reward a man according to what he doesand bring upon him the consequences of his ways
12  for a certainty god does not act wickedlythe almighty does not pervert justice
13  who put him in charge of the earthand who appointed him over the whole world
14  if he fixes his attention on themif he gathers their spirit and breath to himself
15  all humans would perish togetherand mankind would return to the dust
16  so if you have understanding pay attention to thislisten carefully to what i say
17  should someone who hates justice be in controlor would you condemn a powerful one who is righteous
18  would you say to a king you are good for nothing or to nobles you are wicked
19  there is one who does not show partiality to princesand who does not favor the rich over the poorfor they are all the work of his hands
20  they may die suddenly in the middle of the nightthey shake violently and pass awayeven the powerful are removed but not by human hands
21  for gods eyes are upon the ways of a manand he sees all his steps
22  there is no darkness or deep shadowwhere wrongdoers can conceal themselves
23  for god has not set an appointed time for any manto appear before him in judgment
24  he breaks the powerful without needing to investigateand sets up others in their place
25  for he knows what they are doinghe overthrows them during the night and they are crushed
26  he strikes them for their wickednessin a place where all can see
27  because they have turned away from following himand have no regard for any of his ways
28  they cause the poor to cry out to himso that he hears the outcry of the helpless
29  when god remains silent who can condemn him when he hides his face who can see him whether toward a nation or a man the result is the same
30  so that a godless person may not ruleor lay snares for the people
31  for will anyone say to godi have been punished although i have committed no offense
32  teach me what i have failed to seeif i have done anything wrong i will not do it again
33  should he reward you on your terms when you reject his judgment you must decide not i
so tell me what you know so well
34  men of understanding will say to meany wise man who hears me
35  job speaks without knowledgeand his words lack insight
36  let job be tested to the limitbecause his replies are like those of wicked men
37  he adds rebellion to his sinhe scornfully claps his hands before usand multiplies his words against the true god
37  at this my heart poundsand leaps from its place
2  listen carefully to the rumbling of his voiceand the thunder that comes from his mouth
3  he unleashes it under the entire heavensand sends his lightning to the ends of the earth
4  after that is a roaring soundhe thunders with a majestic voiceand he does not hold it back when his voice is heard
5  god thunders with his voice in a wonderful wayhe does great things that are beyond our understanding
6  for he says to the snow fall to the earth and to the downpour of rain pour down mightily
7  god puts a stop to all human activityso that every mortal man will know his work
8  the wild animals go into their densand remain in their lairs
9  the storm wind blows from its chamberand the cold comes from the north winds
10  by the breath of god the ice is producedand the broad waters are frozen solid
11  yes he weighs down the clouds with moisturehe scatters his lightning in the clouds
12  they swirl around where he directs themthey carry out whatever he commands on the surface of the inhabited earth
13  whether it is for punishment or for the sake of the landor for loyal love he causes it to happen
14  listen to this jobstop and consider carefully the wonderful works of god
15  do you know how god controls the cloudsand how he causes the lightning to flash from his cloud
16  do you know how the clouds float these are the wonderful works of the one perfect in knowledge
17  why does your clothing become hotwhen the earth is still because of the south wind
18  can you with him spread out the skiesas solid as a metal mirror
19  tell us what we should say to himwe cannot answer because we are in the dark
20  should he be told that i want to speak or has anyone said something that should be communicated to him
21  they cannot even see the lightthough it is bright in the skyuntil a wind passes by and clears away the clouds
22  out of the north comes golden splendorgods majesty is aweinspiring
23  understanding the almighty is beyond our reachhe is great in powerand he never violates his justice and abundant righteousness
24  therefore people should fear him
for he does not favor any who think that they are wise
23  job said in reply
2  even today i will complain stubbornlymy strength is exhausted because of my sighing
3  if only i knew where to find god i would go to his place of dwelling
4  i would present my case before himand fill my mouth with arguments
5  i would learn how he would answer meand take note of what he says to me
6  would he contend with me using his great power no surely he would give me a hearing
7  there the upright one could set matters straight with himand i would be acquitted once and for all by my judge
8  but if i go east he is not thereand i return and i cannot find him
9  when he is working on the left i cannot look upon himthen he turns to the right but i still do not see him
10  but he knows the path i have taken
after he has tested me i will come out as pure gold
11  my feet have closely followed his footstepsi have kept to his way without deviating
12  i have not departed from the commandment of his lips
i have treasured up his sayings even more than what was required of me
13  when he is determined who can resist him when he wants to do something he does it
14  for he will carry out completely what has been determined for meand he has many such things in store
15  that is why i am anxious because of himwhen i think about him my fear grows
16  god has made me faintheartedand the almighty has made me afraid
17  but i have not yet been silenced by the darknessnor by the gloom that has covered my face
42  then job said in reply to jehovah
2  now i know that you are able to do all thingsand that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you
3  you said who is this who is obscuring my counsel without knowledge therefore i spoke but without understandingabout things too wonderful for me which i do not know
4  you said please listen and i will speak
i will question you and you inform me
5  my ears have heard about youbut now i do see you with my eyes
6  that is why i take back what i saidand i repent in dust and ashes
7  after jehovah had spoken these words to job jehovah said to elʹiphaz the teʹmanite my anger burns against you and your two companions for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant job has
8  now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up a burnt sacrifice for yourselves
and my servant job will pray for you
i will surely accept his request not to deal with you according to your foolishness for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant job has
9  so elʹiphaz the teʹmanite bilʹdad the shuʹhite and zoʹphar the naʹamathite went and did what jehovah had told them to do
and jehovah accepted jobs prayer
10  after job had prayed for his companions jehovah removed jobs tribulation and restored his prosperity
jehovah gave him double what he had before
11  all his brothers and sisters and all his former friends came to him and ate a meal with him in his house
they sympathized with him and comforted him over all the calamity that jehovah had allowed to come upon him
each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring
12  so jehovah blessed the last part of jobs life more than the beginning and job came to have 14000 sheep 6000 camels 1000 pairs of cattle and 1000 female donkeys
13  he also came to have seven more sons and three more daughters
14  he named the first daughter jemiʹmah the second keziʹah and the third kerʹenhapʹpuch
15  no women in all the land were as beautiful as jobs daughters and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers
16  after this job lived for 140 years and he saw his children and his grandchildrenfour generations
17  finally job died after a long and satisfying life
22  elʹiphaz the teʹmanite said in reply
2  can a man be of use to god can anyone with insight be of benefit to him
3  does the almighty care that you are righteousor does he gain anything because you follow the course of integrity
4  will he punish youand enter into judgment with you for your reverence
5  is it not because your own wickedness is so greatand there is no end to your errors
6  for you seize a pledge from your brothers for no reasonand you strip people of their garments leaving them naked
7  you do not give the tired one a drink of waterand you hold back food from the hungry
8  the land belongs to the powerful manand the favored one dwells in it
9  but you sent away widows emptyhandedand you crushed the arms of fatherless children
10  that is why you are surrounded by trapsand sudden terrors frighten you
11  that is why it is so dark that you cannot seeand a flood of water covers you
12  is not god in the heights of heaven and see how high all the stars are
13  but you have said what does god really know can he judge through thick gloom
14  clouds screen him off so that he does not seeas he walks about on the vault of heaven
15  will you follow the ancient paththat wicked men have walked
16  men who have been snatched away before their timewhose foundation was washed away by a flood
17  they were saying to the true god leave us alone and what can the almighty do to us
18  yet he is the one who filled their houses with good things
such wicked thinking is far from my own
19  the righteous will see this and rejoiceand the innocent will mock them and say
20  our opponents have been destroyedand a fire will consume what is left of them
21  get to know him and you will be at peacethen good things will come your way
22  accept the law from his mouthand keep his sayings in your heart
23  if you return to the almighty you will be restoredif you remove unrighteousness from your tent
24  if you would throw your gold into the dustand the gold of oʹphir into the rocky ravines
25  then the almighty will become your goldand he will be your choicest silver
26  for then your delight will be in the almightyand you will lift up your face to god
27  you will entreat him and he will hear youand your vows you will pay
28  whatever you decide to do will succeedand light will shine upon your path
29  for you will be humiliated when you speak arrogantlybut he will save the humble
30  he will rescue those who are innocentso if your hands are clean you will certainly be rescued
38  then jehovah answered job out of the windstorm
2  who is this who is obscuring my counseland speaking without knowledge
3  brace yourself please like a mani will question you and you inform me
4  where were you when i founded the earth tell me if you think you understand
5  who set its measurements in case you knowor who stretched a measuring line across it
6  into what were its pedestals sunkor who laid its cornerstone
7  when the morning stars joyfully cried out togetherand all the sons of god began shouting in applause
8  and who barricaded the sea behind doorswhen it burst out from the womb
9  when i clothed it with cloudsand wrapped it in thick gloom
10  when i established my limit for itand put its bars and doors in place
11  and i said you may come this far and no fartherhere is where your proud waves will stop
12  have you ever commanded the morningor made the dawn know its place
13  to take hold of the ends of the earthand to shake the wicked out of it
14  it is transformed like clay under a sealand its features stand out like those of a garment
15  but the light of the wicked is held back from themand their uplifted arm is broken
16  have you gone down to the sources of the seaor explored the deep waters
17  have the gates of death been revealed to youor have you seen the gates of deep darkness
18  have you understood the vast expanse of the earth tell me if you know all of this
19  in which direction does the light reside and where is the place of darkness
20  that you should take it to its territoryand understand the paths to its home
21  do you know this because you were already bornand the number of your years is great
22  have you entered the storehouses of the snowor have you seen the storehouses of the hail
23  which i have reserved for the time of distressfor the day of battle and war
24  from what direction is light dispersedand from where does the east wind blow on the earth
25  who has cut a channel for the floodand made a path for the thunderous storm cloud
26  to make it rain where no man liveson the wilderness where there are no humans
27  to satisfy devastated wastelandsand cause the grass to sprout
28  does the rain have a fatheror who fathered the dewdrops
29  from whose womb did the ice emergeand who gave birth to the frost of heaven
30  when the waters are covered as if with stoneand the surface of the deep waters is frozen solid
31  can you tie the ropes of the kiʹmah constellationor untie the cords of the keʹsil constellation
32  can you lead out a constellation in its seasonor guide the ash constellation along with its sons
33  do you know the laws governing the heavensor can you impose their authority on the earth
34  can you raise your voice to the cloudsto cause a flood of water to cover you
35  can you send out lightning bolts will they come and say to you here we are
36  who put wisdom within the cloudsor gave understanding to the sky phenomenon
37  who is wise enough to count the cloudsor who can tip over the water jars of heaven
38  when the dust pours into a massand the clods of earth stick together
39  can you hunt prey for a lionor satisfy the appetites of young lions
40  when they crouch in their lairsor lie in ambush in their dens
41  who prepares food for the ravenwhen its young cry to god for helpand wander about because there is nothing to eat
32  so these three men stopped trying to answer job because he was convinced of his own righteousness
2  but eliʹhu the son of barʹachel the buzʹite of the family of ram had become very angry
his anger blazed against job for trying to prove himself right rather than god
3  he was also very angry with jobs three companions because they could not find an answer but had declared god wicked
4  eliʹhu had been waiting to respond to job because they were older than he was
5  when eliʹhu saw that the three men had nothing to say in answer his anger flared up
6  so eliʹhu the son of barʹachel the buzʹite began to speak saying i am youngand you men are aged
so i respectfully held backand i dared not tell you what i know
7  i thought let age speakand let a multitude of years declare wisdom
8  but it is the spirit in peoplethe breath of the almighty that gives them understanding
9  age alone does not make one wisenor is it only old men who understand what is right
10  so i say listen to meand i will also tell you what i know
11  look i have waited for your wordsi kept listening to your reasoningas you searched for things to say
12  i paid close attention to youbut none of you could prove job wrongor answer his arguments
13  so do not say we have found wisdomit is god who refutes him not a man
14  he did not direct his words against meso i will not reply to him with your arguments
15  they are dismayed they have no more answersthey have nothing left to say
16  i have waited but they do not continue speakingthey just stand there with no further answer
17  so i too will give an answeri too will tell what i know
18  for i am full of wordsthe spirit within me compels me
19  my insides are like wine that has no ventlike new wineskins ready to burst
20  let me speak so that i can find relief i will open my lips and give an answer
21  i will not show partiality to anyonenor will i flatter any human
22  for i do not know how to flatterif i did my maker would quickly do away with me
6  job then said in reply
2  if only my anguish could be fully weighedand put on scales together with my calamity
3  for now it is heavier than the sands of the seas
that is why my words have been wild talk
4  for the arrows of the almighty have pierced meand my spirit is drinking their venomthe terrors from god are lined up against me
5  will a wild donkey cry out when it has grassor will a bull bellow when it has fodder
6  is tasteless food eaten without saltor is there flavor in the juice of a mallow
7  i have refused to touch such things
they are like contamination in my food
8  o that my request would be realizedand that god would grant my desire
9  that god would be willing to crush meand that he would reach out his hand and do away with me
10  for even that would bring me comforti would leap for joy despite the unrelenting painfor i have not denied the sayings of the holy one
11  do i have the strength to keep waiting and what end awaits me that i should continue to live
12  is my strength like that of rock or is my flesh made of copper
13  is there any way that i can help myselfwhen all my means of support has been driven from me
14  anyone who withholds loyal love from his fellow manwill forsake the fear of the almighty
15  my own brothers have been as treacherous as a winter streamlike the water of winter streams that dry up
16  they are darkened by iceand in them the melting snow is hidden
17  but in due season they become waterless and come to an endwhen it becomes hot they dry up
18  their course is divertedthey flow into the desert and vanish
19  the caravans of teʹma look for themthe travelers from sheʹba wait for them
20  they are ashamed because of their misplaced trustthey come there only to be disappointed
21  for this is how you have become to meyou have seen the terror of my calamity and you are afraid
22  have i said give me something or requested that you make a gift for me from your wealth
23  have i asked to be rescued from the hand of an enemyor to be saved from oppressors
24  instruct me and i will be silenthelp me to understand my mistake
25  honest words are not painful but what benefit can be found in your reproof
26  are you scheming to reprove my wordsa desperate mans sayings which the wind blows away
27  you would also cast lots over an orphanand sell your own friend
28  so now turn and look at mefor i would not lie to your very faces
29  reconsider pleasedo not misjudge meyes reconsider for my righteousness is yet intact
30  is my tongue speaking unjustly does my palate not discern that something is wrong
31  i have made a covenant with my eyes
so how could i show improper attention to a virgin
2  what then would be my share from god abovewhat inheritance from the almighty on high
3  does not disaster await the wrongdoerand calamity those doing what is harmful
4  does he not see my waysand count all my steps
5  have i ever walked in untruth has my foot hurried to deceive
6  let god weigh me with accurate scalesthen he will recognize my integrity
7  if my footsteps deviate from the wayor my heart has followed after my eyesor my hands have been defiled
8  then let me sow seed and someone else eatand let what i plant be uprooted
9  if my heart has been enticed by a womanand i have lain in wait at my neighbors door
10  then let my wife grind grain for another manand let other men have sexual relations with her
11  for that would be shameful conductan error deserving punishment by the judges
12  it would be a fire that would devour and destroyconsuming even the roots of all my produce
13  if i denied justice to my male or female servantswhen they had a complaint against me
14  what can i do when god confronts me what can i answer him when he calls for an accounting
15  did not the one who made me in the womb also make them was it not the same one who formed us before our birth
16  if i refused to give the poor what they desiredor saddened the eyes of the widow
17  if i ate my portion of food alonewithout sharing it with the orphans
18  for from my youth the orphan grew up with me as though i were his fatherand i have been a guide for the widow from childhood
19  if i saw anyone perishing for lack of clothingor a poor man with nothing to cover himself
20  if he did not bless meas he warmed himself with the wool of my sheep
21  if i shook my fist against the orphanwhen he needed my assistance in the city gate
22  then let my arm fall from my shoulderand let my arm be broken at the elbow
23  for i dreaded disaster from godand i could not stand before his dignity
24  if i put my confidence in goldor said to fine gold you are my security
25  if i found my joy in my great wealthbecause of the many possessions i acquired
26  if i saw the sun shiningor the moon moving in its splendor
27  and my heart was secretly enticedand my mouth kissed my hand in worship of them
28  then that would be an error deserving punishment by the judgesfor i would have denied the true god above
29  have i ever rejoiced over the destruction of my enemyor gloated because evil befell him
30  i never allowed my mouth to sinby asking for his life in an oath
31  have the men of my tent not saidwho can find anyone who has not been satisfied with his food
32  no stranger had to spend the night outsidei opened my doors to the traveler
33  have i ever tried to cover over my transgressions like other menby hiding my error in the pocket of my garment
34  have i been in fear of the reaction of the multitudeor have i been terrified by the contempt of other familiesmaking me silent and afraid to go outside
35  if only someone would listen to me i would sign my name to what i have said
let the almighty answer me if only my accuser had written out the charges in a document
36  i would carry it on my shoulderand i would bind it around my head like a crown
37  i would give him an accounting for every step i tooki would approach him confidently like a prince
38  if my own ground would cry out against meand its furrows would weep together
39  if i have eaten its fruitage without paymentor if i have caused its owners to despair
40  then let thorns sprout for me instead of wheatand foulsmelling weeds instead of barley
the words of job end here
21  job said in reply
2  listen carefully to what i saylet this be the consolation you give me
3  bear with me while i speakafter i speak you may then mock me
4  is my complaint directed toward a man if it were would i not lose patience
5  look at me and stare in amazementput your hand over your mouth
6  when i think about it i am disturbedand my whole body shudders
7  why do the wicked live ongrow old and become wealthy
8  their children are always in their presenceand they get to see their descendants
9  their houses are secure they are free from fearand god does not punish them with his rod
10  their bulls breed without failuretheir cows give birth and do not miscarry
11  their boys run outside just like a flockand their children skip about
12  they sing accompanied by tambourine and harpand rejoice at the sound of the flute
13  they spend their days in contentmentand go down peacefully to the grave
14  but they say to the true god leave us alone we have no desire to know your ways
15  who is the almighty that we should serve him what would we gain by being acquainted with him
16  but i know that they do not control their own prosperity
the thinking of the wicked is far from me
17  how often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished how often does disaster come upon them how often does god deal out destruction to them in his anger
18  do they ever become like straw before the windand like chaff that a storm wind carries away
19  god will store up a mans punishment for his own sons
but may god repay him so that he will know it
20  may his own eyes see his ruinand may he be the one to drink from the rage of the almighty
21  for what does he care about what happens to his house after himif the number of his months is cut short
22  can anyone teach knowledge to godwhen he is the one who judges even the highest ones
23  one man dies in his full vigorwhen he is completely carefree and at ease
24  when his thighs are padded with fatand his bones are strong
25  but another man dies deeply distressednever having tasted good things
26  together they will lie down in the dustand maggots will cover both of them
27  look i know exactly what you are thinkingand the schemes you devise to wrong me
28  for you say where is the house of the prominent manand where is the tent in which the wicked one lived
29  have you not questioned travelers do you not carefully study their observations
30  that an evil person is spared on the day of disasterand rescued on the day of fury
31  who will confront him about his wayand who will repay him for what he has done
32  when he is carried to the graveyarda vigil will be kept over his tomb
33  the clods of earth of the valley will be sweet to himand all mankind follows after himlike the countless number before him
34  so why offer me meaningless comfort there is nothing but deceit in your answers
25  bilʹdad the shuʹhite said in reply
2  rulership and fearsome might are hishe establishes peace in heaven
3  can his troops be numbered upon whom does his light not rise
4  so how can mortal man be righteous before godor how can one born of a woman be innocent
5  even the moon is not brightand the stars are not pure in his eyes
6  how much less so mortal man who is a maggotand a son of man who is a worm
13  yes my eye has seen all of thismy ear has heard and understood it
2  what you know i also knowi am not inferior to you
3  for my part i would rather speak to the almighty himselfi desire to argue my case with god
4  but you are smearing me with liesall of you are useless physicians
5  if only you would keep absolutely silentthat would show wisdom on your part
6  listen please to my argumentsand pay attention to the pleadings of my lips
7  will you speak unjustly on gods behalfand will you speak deceitfully for him
8  will you take his sidewill you try to plead the case of the true god
9  would it turn out well if he examined you will you fool him as you would a mortal man
10  he will surely rebuke youif you secretly try to show favoritism
11  will not his very dignity terrify youand the dread of him fall upon you
12  your wise sayings are proverbs of ashesyour defenses are as fragile as defenses of clay
13  keep silent before me so that i may speak
then let whatever may come upon me come
14  why do i put myself in dangerand take my life in my hands
15  though he may slay me i would still waiti would argue my case before his face
16  he would then become my salvationfor no godless person may come in before him
17  listen closely to my wordpay attention to my declaration
18  see now i have prepared my legal casei know i am in the right
19  who will contend with me i would die if i were to stay silent
20  only grant two things to me o godso that i will not conceal myself from before you
21  remove your heavy hand far away from meand do not let the fear of you terrify me
22  either call and i will answeror let me speak and you answer me
23  what are my errors and sins reveal to me my transgression and my sin
24  why do you hide your faceand consider me your enemy
25  will you try to frighten a windblown leafor chase after dry stubble
26  for you keep recording bitter accusations against meand you make me answer for the sins of my youth
27  you have put my feet in stocksyou scrutinize all my pathsand you trace out each of my footprints
28  so man decays like something rottenlike a garment eaten by moths
14  man born of womanis shortlived and filled with trouble
2  he comes up like a blossom and then withers awayhe flees like a shadow and disappears
3  yes you have fixed your eye upon himand you bring him into judgment with yourself
4  who can produce someone clean from someone unclean no one can
5  if his days are decidedthe number of his months is with youyou have set a limit for him that he may not go beyond
6  turn your gaze away from him so that he may restuntil like a hired worker he finishes out his day
7  for there is hope even for a tree
if it is cut down it will sprout againand its twigs will continue to grow
8  if its root grows old in the groundand its stump dies in the soil
9  at the scent of water it will sproutand it will produce branches like a new plant
10  but a man dies and lies powerlesswhen a human expires where is he
11  waters disappear from the seaand a river drains away and dries up
12  man also lies down and does not get up
until heaven is no more they will not wake upnor will they be aroused from their sleep
13  o that in the grave you would conceal methat you would hide me until your anger passes bythat you would set a time limit for me and remember me
14  if a man dies can he live again i will wait all the days of my compulsory serviceuntil my relief comes
15  you will call and i will answer you
you will long for the work of your hands
16  but for now you keep counting my every stepyou watch only for my sin
17  my transgression is sealed up in a bagand you seal up my error with glue
18  as a mountain falls and crumbles awayand a rock is dislodged from its place
19  as water wears away stonesand its torrents wash away earths soilso you have destroyed the hope of mortal man
20  you keep overpowering him until he perishesyou change his appearance and you send him away
21  his sons are honored but he does not know itthey become insignificant but he does not realize it
22  he feels pain only while he is still in his fleshhe mourns only while he is still alive
29  job continued his discourse saying
2  if only i were in the months gone byin the days when god was watching over me
3  when he caused his lamp to shine upon my headwhen i walked through darkness by his light
4  when i was in my primewhen gods friendship was felt in my tent
5  when the almighty was still with mewhen my children were all around me
6  when my steps were awash in butterand the rocks poured out streams of oil for me
7  when i used to go out to the city gateand take my seat in the public square
8  the young men would see me and step asideand even the old men would rise and remain standing
9  princes refrained from speakingthey would put their hand over their mouth
10  the voices of the prominent men were silencedtheir tongue was stuck to the roof of their mouth
11  whoever heard me would speak well of meand those who saw me would testify for me
12  for i would rescue the poor who cried for helpalong with the fatherless child and anyone who had no helper
13  the one about to perish would bless meand i made the heart of the widow rejoice
14  i put on righteousness as my clothingmy justice was like a robe and a turban
15  i became eyes to the blindand feet to the lame
16  i was a father to the poori would investigate the legal case of those i did not know
17  i would break the jaws of the wrongdoerand tear the prey away from his teeth
18  i used to say i will die in my own homeand my days will be as numerous as the grains of sand
19  my roots will spread out into the watersand dew will stay all night on my branches
20  my glory is constantly renewedand the bow in my hand will keep shooting
21  people would listen expectantlywaiting in silence for my advice
22  after i had spoken they had nothing more to saymy words would fall gently on their ears
23  they waited for me as for the rainthey opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain
24  when i smiled at them they could hardly believe itthe light of my face would reassure them
25  i gave them direction as their headand i lived like a king among his troopslike one who comforts the mourners
40  jehovah continued to answer job
2  should a faultfinder contend with the almighty let the one who wants to reprove god answer
3  job said in answer to jehovah
4  look i am unworthy
what can i reply to you i put my hand over my mouth
5  i spoke once but i will not answer againtwice but i will say no more
6  then jehovah answered job out of the windstorm
7  brace yourself please like a mani will question you and you inform me
8  will you call into question my justice will you condemn me so that you may be right
9  do you have an arm as powerful as the true godsor can your voice thunder like his
10  adorn yourself please with glory and majestyclothe yourself with dignity and splendor
11  release the fury of your angerlook at everyone who is haughty and bring him low
12  look at everyone who is haughty and humble himand tread down the wicked where they stand
13  hide them all in the dustbind them in the hidden place
14  then even i would acknowledge to youthat your right hand can save you
15  here now is beheʹmoth which i made as i made you
it eats grass like a bull
16  look at the strength in its hipsand the power in the muscles of its belly
17  it stiffens its tail like a cedarthe sinews of its thighs are woven together
18  its bones are tubes of copperits limbs are like wroughtiron rods
19  it ranks first among the works of godonly its maker can approach it with his sword
20  for the mountains produce food for itwhere all the wild animals play
21  it lies down under the lotus treesin the shelter of the reeds of the marsh
22  the lotus trees cast their shadow on itand the poplars of the valley surround it
23  if the river is turbulent it does not panic
it is confident although the jordan rushes against its mouth
24  can anyone capture it while it is watchingor pierce its nose with a hook
39  do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth have you watched the deer give birth to their young
2  do you count the months that they must complete do you know the time when they give birth
3  they crouch down when they give birth to their youngand their labor pains end
4  their young become strong and grow up in the open fieldthey go out and do not return to them
5  who set the wild donkey freeand who untied the ropes of the wild donkey
6  i have made the desert plain its homeand the salt land its dwelling
7  it scorns the tumult of the cityit does not hear the shouts of the driver
8  it roams the hills seeking pasturelooking for every green plant
9  is the wild bull willing to serve you will it spend the night in your stable
10  will you hold a wild bull to the furrow with a ropeor will it follow you to plow the valley
11  will you trust in its great strengthand let it do your heavy work
12  will you rely on it to bring back your harvestand will it gather it to your threshing floor
13  the wings of the ostrich flap joyfullybut can her pinions and plumage compare with the storks
14  for she leaves her eggs on the groundand she keeps them warm in the dust
15  she forgets that some foot may crush themor that a wild animal may trample them
16  she treats her sons harshly as if they were not hersshe has no fear that her labor may be in vain
17  for god has deprived her of wisdomand given her no share in understanding
18  but when she rises up and flaps her wingsshe laughs at the horse and at its rider
19  are you the one who gives the horse its strength do you clothe its neck with a rustling mane
20  can you cause it to leap like a locust its majestic snorting is terrifying
21  it paws the ground in the valley and exults mightilyit charges into the battle
22  it laughs at fear and is afraid of nothing
it does not turn back because of the sword
23  the quiver rattles against itthe spear and the javelin flash
24  trembling with excitement it surges forwardit cannot stand still at the sound of the horn
25  when the horn blows it says aha it smells the battle from afarand hears the shouting of commanders and the battle cry
26  is it by your understanding that the falcon soarsspreading its wings to the south
27  or is it at your order that an eagle flies upwardand builds its nest high up
28  spending the night on a cliffdwelling in its stronghold on a rocky crag
29  from there it searches for foodits eyes look far into the distance
30  its young sip up bloodand wherever the slain are there it is
19  job said in reply
2  how long will you keep irritating my soulcrushing me with words
3  these ten times you have rebuked meyou are not ashamed to deal harshly with me
4  and if indeed i made a mistakemy error remains with me
5  if you insist on exalting yourselves over meclaiming that the reproach against me is justified
6  know then that it is god who has misled meand he has caught me in his hunting net
7  look i keep crying out violence but i get no answeri keep crying for help but there is no justice
8  my path he has blocked with a stone wall and i cannot pass byhe has covered my roadways with darkness
9  he has stripped me of my gloryand removed the crown from my head
10  he breaks me down on all sides until i perishmy hope he uproots like a tree
11  his anger burns against meand he views me as his enemy
12  his troops come together and besiege meand they camp around my tent
13  my own brothers he has driven far away from meand those who know me have turned away from me
14  my close companions are goneand those whom i knew well have forgotten me
15  guests in my house and my slave girls consider me a strangeri am a foreigner in their eyes
16  i call for my servant but he does not respondwith my mouth i beg him for compassion
17  my very breath has become loathsome to my wifeand i am a stench to my own brothers
18  even young children despise mewhen i rise up they begin jeering at me
19  all my close friends detest meand those whom i loved have turned against me
20  my bones stick to my skin and my fleshand i escape with the skin of my teeth
21  show me mercy my companions show me mercyfor gods own hand has touched me
22  why do you keep persecuting me as god doesattacking me without letup
23  if only my words were written downif only they could be inscribed in a book
24  o that they were carved forever in the rockwith an iron stylus and lead
25  for i well know that my redeemer is alivehe will come later and rise up over the earth
26  after my skin has thus been destroyedwhile yet in my flesh i will see god
27  whom i will see for myselfwhom my own eyes will see not someone elses
but deep inside i feel overwhelmed
28  for you say in what way are we persecuting him since the root of the problem is with me
29  be in fear of the sword yourselvesfor the sword brings punishment against errorsyou should know that there is a judge
24  why does the almighty not set a time why do those who know him not see his day
2  people move boundary markersthey carry off flocks for their own pasture
3  they drive away the donkey of fatherless childrenand seize the widows bull as security for a loan
4  they force the poor off the roadthe helpless of the earth must hide from them
5  the poor forage for food like wild donkeys in the wildernessthey seek food in the desert for their children
6  they must harvest in anothers fieldand glean from the vineyard of the wicked
7  they spend the night naked without clothingthey have no covering for the cold
8  they are drenched by the mountain rainsthey cling to the rocks for lack of shelter
9  the fatherless child is snatched away from the breastand the garments of the poor are taken as security for a loan
10  forcing them to go about naked without clothingand hungry as they carry the sheaves of grain
11  they toil among the terrace walls in the heat of the daythey tread the winepresses yet they go thirsty
12  the dying keep groaning in the citythe fatally wounded cry for helpbut god does not regard this as improper
13  there are those who rebel against lightthey do not recognize its waysand they do not follow its paths
14  the murderer rises at daybreakhe slays the helpless and the poorwhile at night he engages in theft
15  the eye of the adulterer waits for the twilightsaying no one will see me and he covers his face
16  in the darkness they break into housesby day they shut themselves in
they are strangers to the light
17  for morning is the same as deep darkness for themthey are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness
18  but they are swiftly carried away by the waters
their portion of the land will be cursed
they will not return to their vineyards
19  just as drought and heat take away the melted snowthe grave takes away those who have sinned
20  his mother will forget him the maggot will feast on him
he will be remembered no more
and unrighteousness will be broken just like a tree
21  he preys on the barren womanand mistreats the widow
22  god will use his strength to do away with the powerfulthough they may rise up they have no assurance of life
23  god lets them become confident and securebut his eyes are on everything they do
24  they are exalted for a little while then they are no more
they are brought low and gathered like everyone elsethey are cut off like heads of grain
25  now who can prove me a liaror refute my word
5  call please is there anyone answering you to which of the holy ones will you turn
2  for resentment will kill the foolish oneand envy will put the simpleminded to death
3  i have seen the foolish one taking rootbut suddenly his dwelling place is cursed
4  his sons are far from safetyand they are crushed at the city gate with no one to save them
5  the hungry one eats what he harveststaking it even from among the thornsand their possessions are ensnared
6  for harmful things do not sprout from the dustand trouble does not spring from the ground
7  for man is born for troubleas surely as sparks fly upward
8  but i would appeal to godand to god i would submit my case
9  to the one doing great and unsearchable thingswonderful things without number
10  he gives rain to the earthand sends waters upon the fields
11  he raises the lowly up highand he raises up the dejected one to salvation
12  he frustrates the schemes of the craftyso that the work of their hands does not succeed
13  he catches the wise in their own cunningso that the plans of the shrewd are thwarted
14  they meet with darkness during the dayand they grope about at midday as if it were night
15  he saves from the sword of their mouthsaving the poor from the hand of the strong
16  so that there is hope for the lowlybut the mouth of unrighteousness is shut
17  look happy is the man whom god reprovesso do not reject the discipline of the almighty
18  for he causes pain but binds up the woundhe breaks apart but heals with his own hands
19  he will save you from six calamitieseven the seventh will not harm you
20  during famine he will redeem you from deathand from the power of a sword during war
21  you will be protected from the lash of the tongueand you will not fear devastation when it comes
22  you will laugh at destruction and hungerand you will not fear the wild beasts of the earth
23  for the stones of the field will not harm youand the wild beasts of the field will be at peace with you
24  you will know that your tent is secureand nothing will be missing when you inspect your pasture
25  you will enjoy many childrenand your descendants will be as plentiful as the vegetation of the earth
26  you will still be strong when you go to the gravelike sheaves of grain gathered in their season
27  look we have investigated this and it is so
listen and accept it
36  eliʹhu continued
2  be patient with me a little longer while i explainfor i still have words to speak on gods behalf
3  i will speak comprehensively about what i knowand i will ascribe righteousness to my maker
4  truly my words are not falsethe one perfect in knowledge is here before you
5  indeed god is mighty and rejects no onehe is great in his power of understanding
6  he will not preserve the lives of the wickedbut he gives justice to the afflicted
7  he does not take his eyes off the righteoushe enthrones them with kings and they are exalted forever
8  but if they are bound in shacklesand caught in ropes of affliction
9  he reveals to them what they have donetheir transgressions caused by their pride
10  he opens their ears to correctionand tells them to turn away from wrongdoing
11  if they obey and serve himthey will live out their days in prosperityand their years will be pleasant
12  but if they do not obey they will perish by the swordand die without knowledge
13  the godless at heart will harbor resentment
they do not cry for help even when he binds them
14  they die while still youngspending their life among male temple prostitutes
15  but god rescues the afflicted during their afflictionhe opens their ear when they are oppressed
16  he draws you away from the brink of distressto a broad space free of restrictionwith rich food on your table as consolation
17  then you will be satisfied with the judgment on the wickedwhen judgment is rendered and justice is upheld
18  but take care that rage does not lead you into spitefulnessand do not let a large bribe lead you astray
19  would your cry for helpor any of your strenuous efforts keep you from distress
20  do not long for the nightwhen people vanish from their place
21  beware that you do not turn to wrongdoingchoosing this instead of affliction
22  look god is exalted in his powerwhat instructor is like him
23  who has directed his wayor said to him what you have done is wrong
24  remember to magnify his activityof which men have sung
25  all mankind has seen itmortal man looks on from a distance
26  yes god is greater than we can knowthe number of his years is beyond comprehension
27  he draws up the drops of waterthey condense into rain from his mist
28  then the clouds pour it downthey shower down upon mankind
29  can anyone understand the layers of cloudsthe thundering from his tent
30  see how he spreads his lightning over itand covers the depths of the sea
31  by these he sustains the peopleshe gives them food in abundance
32  with his hands he covers the lightningand he directs it against its target
33  his thunder tells about himeven the livestock tell who is coming
41  can you catch leviʹathan with a fishhookor hold down its tongue with a rope
2  can you put a rope through its nostrilsor pierce its jaws with a hook
3  will it make many pleas to youor will it speak gently to you
4  will it make a covenant with youso that you may make it your slave for life
5  will you play with it as with a birdor tie it on a leash for your little girls
6  will traders barter for it will they divide it up among merchants
7  will you fill its hide with harpoonsor its head with fishing spears
8  lay your hand on ityou will remember the battle and never do it again
9  any hope of subduing it is futile
the mere sight of it would overwhelm you
10  no one dares to stir it up
so who is it who can stand up to me
11  who has given me anything first that i should repay him whatever is under the heavens is mine
12  i will not be silent about its limbsabout its mightiness and its wellformed body
13  who has removed its outer covering who will enter its open jaws
14  who can pry open the doors of its mouth its teeth all around are fearsome
15  its back has rows of scalestightly sealed together
16  each one fits so closely to the otherthat no air can come between them
17  they are stuck to one anotherthey cling together and cannot be separated
18  its snorting flashes out lightand its eyes are like the rays of dawn
19  flashes of lightning go out of its mouthfiery sparks escape
20  smoke pours out of its nostrilslike a furnace fueled with rushes
21  its breath sets coals ablazeand a flame shoots from its mouth
22  there is great strength in its neckand dismay runs before it
23  the folds of its flesh are tightly joined togetherthey are firm as though cast upon it and immovable
24  its heart is hard as stoneyes hard as a lower millstone
25  when it rises up even the mighty are frightenedits thrashing causes bewilderment
26  no sword that reaches it will prevailnor will spear dart or arrowhead
27  it regards iron as strawcopper as rotten wood
28  an arrow does not make it fleeslingstones turn into stubble against it
29  it regards a club as stubbleand it laughs at the rattling of a javelin
30  underneath it is like sharp fragments of potteryit spreads itself in the mud like a threshing sledge
31  it makes the deep boil just like a potit stirs up the sea like an ointment pot
32  it leaves a glistening wake in its path
one would think that the deep had white hair
33  there is nothing like it on the eartha creature made to have no fear
34  it glares at everything that is haughty
it is king over all the majestic wild beasts
15  elʹiphaz the teʹmanite said in reply
2  will a wise person answer with empty argumentsor will he fill his belly with the east wind
3  reproving with mere words is uselessand talk alone is of no benefit
4  for you undermine the fear of godand you diminish any concern for god
5  for your error dictates what you sayand you choose crafty speech
6  your own mouth condemns you and not iyour own lips testify against you
7  were you the first man ever bornor was your birth before that of the hills
8  do you listen to the confidential talk of godor do you limit wisdom to yourself
9  what do you know that we do not know what do you understand that we do not
10  both the grayhaired and the aged are among usmen much older than your father
11  are gods consolations not enough for youor words spoken gently to you
12  why does your heart carry you awayand why do your eyes flash with anger
13  for you turn your spirit against god himselfand you allow such words to go out of your own mouth
14  what is mortal man that he should be pureor anyone born of a woman that he should be righteous
15  look he has no faith in his holy onesand even the heavens are not pure in his eyes
16  how much less so when a person is detestable and corrupta man who drinks in unrighteousness just like water
17  i will inform you listen to me i will relate what i have seen
18  what wise men have related from their fathersthings they have not hidden
19  to them alone the land was givenand no stranger passed among them
20  a wicked person suffers torment all his daysthroughout all the years reserved for the tyrant
21  terrifying sounds are in his earsin a time of peace marauders attack him
22  he does not believe that he will escape from darknesshe is reserved for a sword
23  he wanders about in search of foodwhere is it he well knows that the day of darkness is at hand
24  distress and anguish keep terrifying himthey overpower him like a king ready to launch an attack
25  for he raises his hand against god himselfand tries to defy the almighty
26  he stubbornly rushes against himwith his thick strong shield
27  his face is covered with fatand his hips bulge with fat
28  he resides in cities that will be brought to ruinin houses where no one will dwellwhich will become heaps of stones
29  he will not grow rich and his wealth will not accumulatenor will his possessions spread over the land
30  he will not escape from darknessa flame will dry up his twigand he will pass away by a blast of gods mouth
31  he should not go astray and trust in what is worthlessfor what he gets in exchange will be worthless
32  it will happen before his dayand his branches will never flourish
33  he will be like a vine that shakes off its unripe grapesand like an olive tree that casts off its blossoms
34  for the assembly of godless ones is sterileand fire will consume the tents of bribery
35  they conceive trouble and give birth to what is wickedand their womb produces deceit
20  zoʹphar the naʹamathite said in reply
2  this is why my own troubling thoughts urge me to answerbecause of the agitation i feel
3  i have heard a reproof that insults meand my understanding impels me to reply
4  surely you must have always known thisfor it has been so since man was put on the earth
5  that the joyful cry of the wicked is briefand the rejoicing of the godless one is for a moment
6  although his greatness ascends to heavenand his head reaches to the clouds
7  he will perish forever like his own dungthose who used to see him will say where is he
8  he will fly off like a dream and they will not find himhe will be chased away like a vision of the night
9  the eye that once saw him will not do so againand his place will behold him no more
10  his own children will seek the favor of the poorand his own hands will give back his wealth
11  his bones were full of youthful vigorbut it will lie down with him in mere dust
12  if what is bad tastes sweet in his mouthif he hides it under his tongue
13  if he savors it and does not let it gobut keeps holding it in his mouth
14  his food will turn sour inside himit will become like the poison of cobras within him
15  he has swallowed down wealth but he will vomit it upgod will empty it out of his belly
16  the venom of cobras he will suckthe fangs of a viper will kill him
17  he will never see the streams of waterthe torrents of honey and butter
18  he will give back his goods without consuming themhe will not enjoy the wealth from his trade
19  for he has crushed and abandoned the poorhe has seized a house that he did not build
20  but he will feel no peace within himselfhis wealth will not help him escape
21  there is nothing left for him to devourthat is why his prosperity will not last
22  when his wealth reaches its peak anxiety will overtake himthe full force of misfortune will come against him
23  as he fills his bellygod will send his burning anger upon himraining it down upon him into his bowels
24  when he flees from weapons of ironarrows from a copper bow will pierce him
25  he pulls an arrow from his backa glittering weapon from his galland terror seizes him
26  total darkness awaits his treasuresa fire that no one fanned will consume himcalamity awaits any survivors in his tent
27  heaven will uncover his errorthe earth will rise up against him
28  a flood will sweep his house awayit will be a heavy torrent on the day of gods anger
29  this is the wicked mans share from godthe inheritance that god has decreed for him
1  there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job
he was an upright man of integrity he feared god and shunned what was bad
2  seven sons and three daughters were born to him
3  his livestock amounted to 7000 sheep 3000 camels 1000 cattle and 500 donkeys along with a very large number of servants so that he became the greatest of all the people of the east
4  each of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day
they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them
5  after a series of banquet days was complete job would send for them in order to sanctify them
then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them
for job said maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed god in their heart
that is what job would always do
6  now the day came when the sons of the true god entered to take their station before jehovah and satan also entered among them
7  then jehovah said to satan where have you come from satan answered jehovah from roving about on the earth and from walking about in it
8  and jehovah said to satan have you taken note of my servant job there is no one like him on the earth
he is an upright man of integrity fearing god and shunning what is bad
9  at that satan answered jehovah is it for nothing that job has feared god
10  have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has you have blessed the work of his hands and his livestock has spread out in the land
11  but for a change stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your very face
12  then jehovah said to satan look everything that he has is in your hand
only do not lay your hand on the man himself so satan went out from the presence of jehovah
13  now on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brothers house
14  a messenger came to job and said the cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them
15  when the sabeʹans attacked and took them and they killed the servants with the sword
i am the only one who escaped to tell you
16  while he was still speaking another one came and said fire from god fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them i am the only one who escaped to tell you
17  while he was still speaking another one came and said the chaldeʹans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and they killed the servants with the sword
i am the only one who escaped to tell you
18  while he was still speaking yet another one came and said your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brothers house
19  suddenly a great wind came from the wilderness and it struck the four corners of the house so that it fell on the young people and they were killed
i am the only one who escaped to tell you
20  at that job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head then he fell to the ground and bowed down
21  and said naked i came out of my mothers womband naked i will return
jehovah has given and jehovah has taken away
let the name of jehovah continue to be praised
22  in all of this job did not sin or accuse god of doing anything wrong
2  afterward the day came when the sons of the true god entered to take their station before jehovah and satan also entered among them to take his station before jehovah
2  then jehovah said to satan where have you come from satan answered jehovah from roving about on the earth and from walking about in it
3  and jehovah said to satan have you taken note of my servant job there is no one like him on the earth
he is an upright man of integrity fearing god and shunning what is bad
he is still holding firmly to his integrity even though you try to incite me against him to destroy him for no reason
4  but satan answered jehovah skin for skin
a man will give everything that he has for his life
5  but for a change stretch out your hand and strike his bone and flesh and he will surely curse you to your very face
6  then jehovah said to satan look he is in your hand only do not take his life
7  so satan went out from the presence of jehovah and struck job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head
8  and job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself and he was sitting among the ashes
9  finally his wife said to him are you still holding firmly to your integrity curse god and die
10  but he said to her you are talking like one of the senseless women
should we accept only what is good from the true god and not accept also what is bad in all of this job did not sin with his lips
11  three companions of job heard about all the calamities that had come upon him and each came from his own placeelʹiphaz the teʹmanite bilʹdad the shuʹhite and zoʹphar the naʹamathite
so they agreed to meet together to go and sympathize with job and comfort him
12  when they saw him from a distance they did not recognize him
they began to weep loudly and to rip their garments apart and they threw dust into the air and onto their heads
13  then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights
no one said a word to him for they saw that his pain was very great
3  it was after this that job began to speak and to curse the day of his birth
2  job said
3  let the day perish on which i was bornalso the night when someone said a man has been conceived
4  let that day be darkness
let god above show no concern for itlet no light shine upon it
5  let the deepest darkness reclaim it
let a rain cloud settle over it
let whatever darkens the day terrify it
6  that nightlet the gloom seize itlet it not rejoice among the days of a yearand let it not enter among the number of the months
7  indeed let that night become barrenlet no joyful cry be heard in it
8  let those who curse the day put a curse on itthose who are able to awaken leviʹathan
9  let the stars of its twilight grow darklet it wait in vain for daylightand let it not see the rays of dawn
10  for it did not close the doors of my mothers wombnor did it hide trouble from my eyes
11  why did i not die at birth why did i not perish when i came from the womb
12  why were there knees to receive meand breasts to nurse me
13  for now i would be lying down undisturbedi would be sleeping and at rest
14  with kings of the earth and their adviserswho built for themselves places that are now in ruins
15  or with princes who possessed goldwhose houses were filled with silver
16  or why was i not like a hidden miscarriagelike children who have never seen the light
17  there even the wicked have ceased from agitationthere the weary are at rest
18  there the prisoners are at ease togetherthey do not hear the voice of the one forcing them to work
19  small and great are the same thereand the slave is set free from his master
20  why does he give light to one who is sufferingand life to those in bitter distress
21  why do they long for death but it does not come they dig for it more than for hidden treasures
22  those who are rejoicing greatlywho are happy when they find the grave
23  why does he give light to a man who has lost his waywhom god has hedged in
24  for in place of my food comes my sighingand my groaning pours out like water
25  for what i have dreaded has come upon meand what i have feared has befallen me
26  i have had no peace no quiet no restbut trouble keeps coming
33  but now job please hear my wordslisten to everything i say
2  look please i must open my mouthmy tongue must speak
3  my words declare the uprightness of my heartand my lips sincerely tell what i know
4  gods own spirit made meand the almightys own breath brought me to life
5  reply to me if you are ablepresent your arguments before me take your position
6  look i am just like you before the true godfrom the clay i too was shaped
7  so no fear of me should terrify youand no pressure from me should overwhelm you
8  but you said in my hearingyes i kept hearing these words
9  i am pure without transgressioni am clean without error
10  but god finds reasons to oppose mehe considers me his enemy
11  he puts my feet in stockshe scrutinizes all my paths
12  but you are not right in saying this so i will answer you god is far greater than mortal man
13  why do you complain against him is it because he did not answer all your words
14  for god speaks once and a second timebut no one pays attention
15  in a dream a vision of the nightwhen deep sleep falls upon peoplewhile they sleep in their beds
16  then he uncovers their earsand impresses his instruction upon them
17  to turn a person away from wrongdoingand to protect a man from pride
18  god spares his soul from the pithis life from perishing by the sword
19  a person is also reproved by pain on his bedand by the constant distress of his bones
20  so that his very being loathes breadand he rejects even fine food
21  his flesh wastes away from sightand his bones that were hidden now protrude
22  his soul draws near to the pithis life to those who bring death
23  if there is a messenger for himone advocate out of a thousandto tell to man what is upright
24  then god shows him favor and saysspare him from going down into the pit i have found a ransom
25  let his flesh become fresher than in youthlet him return to the days of his youthful vigor
26  he will entreat god who will accept himand he will see his face with shouts of joyand he will restore his righteousness to mortal man
27  that person will declare to meni have sinned and distorted what is rightbut i did not receive what i deserved
28  he has redeemed my soul from going into the pitand my life will see the light
29  indeed god does all these thingstwice three times for a man
30  to bring him back from the pitso that he may be enlightened with the light of life
31  pay attention job listen to me keep silent and i will continue speaking
32  if you have something to say reply to me
speak for i want to prove you right
33  if you have nothing to say you should listen to mekeep silent and i will teach you wisdom
12  then job said in reply
2  surely you are the people who knowand wisdom will die out with you
3  but i too have understanding
i am not inferior to you
who does not know these things
4  i have become a laughingstock to my companionsone calling to god for an answer
a righteous and blameless man is a laughingstock
5  the carefree person has contempt for calamitythinking it is only for those whose feet are unsteady
6  the tents of robbers are at peaceand those who provoke god are securethose who have their god in their hands
7  however ask please the animals and they will instruct youalso the birds of the heavens and they will tell you
8  or give consideration to the earth and it will instruct youand the fish of the sea will declare it to you
9  who among all these does not knowthat the hand of jehovah has done this
10  in his hand is the life of every living thingand the spirit of every human
11  does not the ear test out wordsas the tongue tastes food
12  is not wisdom found among the agedand does not understanding come with a long life
13  with him there are wisdom and mightinesshe has counsel and understanding
14  when he tears something down it cannot be rebuiltwhat he has shut no man can open
15  when he withholds the waters everything dries upwhen he sends them out they overwhelm the earth
16  with him there are strength and practical wisdomto him belong the one going astray and the one leading astray
17  he makes counselors go barefootand he makes fools of judges
18  he loosens the bonds imposed by kingsand he binds a belt around their waist
19  he makes priests walk barefootand he overthrows those who are firmly established in power
20  he deprives trusted advisers of speechand takes away the sensibleness of old men
21  he pours out contempt upon noblesand he makes powerful ones weak
22  he reveals deep things from the darknessand he brings deep darkness into the light
23  he makes nations grow great in order to destroy themhe enlarges nations that he may lead them into exile
24  he takes away the understanding of the leaders of the peopleand makes them wander in trackless wastelands
25  they grope in darkness where there is no lighthe makes them wander about like drunken men
