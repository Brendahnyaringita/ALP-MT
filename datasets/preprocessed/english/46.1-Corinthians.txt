10  now i want you to know brothers that our forefathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea
2  and all got baptized into moses by means of the cloud and of the sea
3  and all ate the same spiritual food
4  and all drank the same spiritual drink
for they used to drink from the spiritual rock that followed them and that rock meant the christ
5  nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them for they were struck down in the wilderness
6  now these things became examples for us in order for us not to desire injurious things as they desired them
7  neither become idolaters as some of them did just as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink
then they got up to have a good time
8  neither let us practice sexual immorality as some of them committed sexual immorality only to fall 23000 of them in one day
9  neither let us put jehovah to the test as some of them put him to the test only to perish by the serpents
10  neither be murmurers as some of them murmured only to perish by the destroyer
11  now these things happened to them as examples and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have come
12  so let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall
13  no temptation has come upon you except what is common to men
but god is faithful and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear but along with the temptation he will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it
14  therefore my beloved ones flee from idolatry
15  i speak as to men with discernment judge for yourselves what i say
16  the cup of blessing that we bless is it not a sharing in the blood of the christ the loaf that we break is it not a sharing in the body of the christ
17  because there is one loaf we although many are one body for we are all partaking of that one loaf
18  look at israel in the fleshly sense are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers with the altar
19  what then am i saying that what is sacrificed to an idol is anything or that an idol is anything
20  no but i say that what the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to god and i do not want you to become sharers with the demons
21  you cannot be drinking the cup of jehovah and the cup of demons you cannot be partaking of the table of jehovah and the table of demons
22  or are we inciting jehovah to jealousy we are not stronger than he is are we
23  all things are lawful but not all things are advantageous
all things are lawful but not all things build up
24  let each one keep seeking not his own advantage but that of the other person
25  eat whatever is sold in a meat market making no inquiry because of your conscience
26  for to jehovah belong the earth and everything in it
27  if an unbeliever invites you and you want to go eat whatever is set before you making no inquiry on account of your conscience
28  but if anyone says to you this is something offered in sacrifice do not eat because of the one who told you and because of conscience
29  i do not mean your own conscience but that of the other person
for why should my freedom be judged by another persons conscience
30  if i am partaking with thanks why am i to be spoken of abusively over that for which i give thanks
31  therefore whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else do all things for gods glory
32  keep from becoming causes for stumbling to jews as well as greeks and to the congregation of god
33  just as i am trying to please all people in all things not seeking my own advantage but that of the many so that they may be saved
4  a man should regard us as attendants of christ and stewards of gods sacred secrets
2  in this regard what is expected of stewards is that they be found faithful
3  now to me it is of very little importance to be examined by you or by a human tribunal
in fact i do not even examine myself
4  for i am not conscious of anything against myself
but by this i am not proved righteous the one who examines me is jehovah
5  therefore do not judge anything before the due time until the lord comes
he will bring the secret things of darkness to light and make known the intentions of the hearts and then each one will receive his praise from god
6  now brothers these things i have applied to myself and apol πlos for your good that through us you may learn the rule do not go beyond the things that are written so that you may not be puffed up with pride favoring one against the other
7  for who makes you different from another indeed what do you have that you did not receive if in fact you did receive it why do you boast as though you did not receive it
8  are you already satisfied are you already rich have you begun ruling as kings without us i really wish that you had begun ruling as kings so that we also might rule with you as kings
9  for it seems to me that god has put us the apostles last on exhibition as men condemned to death because we have become a theatrical spectacle to the world and to angels and to men
10  we are fools because of christ but you are discreet in christ we are weak but you are strong you are held in honor but we in dishonor
11  down to this very hour we continue to hunger and thirst and to be poorly clothed and to be beaten and to be homeless
12  and to toil working with our own hands
when insulted we bless when persecuted we patiently endure
13  when slandered we answer mildly we have become as the refuse of the world the offscouring of all things until now
14  i am writing these things not to put you to shame but to admonish you as my beloved children
15  for though you may have 10000 guardians in christ you certainly do not have many fathers for in christ jesus i have become your father through the good news
16  i urge you therefore become imitators of me
17  that is why i am sending timothy to you because he is my beloved and faithful child in the lord
he will remind you of my methods in connection with christ jesus just as i am teaching everywhere in every congregation
18  some are puffed up with pride as though i were not coming to you
19  but i will come to you shortly if jehovah wills and i will get to know not the speech of those who are puffed up with pride but their power
20  for the kingdom of god is a matter not of speech but of power
21  which do you prefer shall i come to you with a rod or with love and mildness of spirit
11  become imitators of me just as i am of christ
2  i commend you because in all things you remember me and you are holding fast the traditions just as i handed them on to you
3  but i want you to know that the head of every man is the christ in turn the head of a woman is the man in turn the head of the christ is god
4  every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head shames his head
5  but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head for it is one and the same as if she were a woman with a shaved head
6  for if a woman does not cover herself she should have her hair cut off but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved she should be covered
7  for a man should not have his head covered as he is gods image and glory but the woman is mans glory
8  for man did not come from woman but woman came from man
9  and what is more man was not created for the sake of the woman but woman for the sake of the man
10  that is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head because of the angels
11  besides in connection with the lord neither is woman separate from man nor is man separate from woman
12  for just as the woman is from the man so also the man is through the woman but all things are from god
13  judge for yourselves is it fitting for a woman to pray to god with her head uncovered
14  does not nature itself teach you that long hair is a dishonor to a man
15  but if a woman has long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given to her instead of a covering
16  however if anyone wants to argue in favor of some other custom we have no other nor do the congregations of god
17  but while giving these instructions i do not commend you because it is not for the better but for the worse that you meet together
18  for first of all i hear that when you come together in a congregation divisions exist among you and to an extent i believe it
19  for there will certainly also be sects among you so that those of you who are approved may also become evident
20  when you come together in one place it is not really to eat the lords evening meal
21  for when you eat it each one takes his own evening meal beforehand so that one is hungry but another is intoxicated
22  do you not have houses for eating and drinking or do you despise the congregation of god and make those who have nothing feel ashamed what can i say to you should i commend you in this i do not commend you
23  for i received from the lord what i also handed on to you that the lord jesus on the night on which he was going to be betrayed took a loaf
24  and after giving thanks he broke it and said this means my body which is in your behalf
keep doing this in remembrance of me
25  he did the same with the cup also after they had the evening meal saying this cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood
keep doing this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me
26  for whenever you eat this loaf and drink this cup you keep proclaiming the death of the lord until he comes
27  therefore whoever eats the loaf or drinks the cup of the lord unworthily will be guilty respecting the body and the blood of the lord
28  first let a man approve himself after scrutiny and only then let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup
29  for the one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment against himself
30  that is why many among you are weak and sick and quite a few are sleeping in death
31  but if we would discern what we ourselves are we would not be judged
32  however when we are judged we are disciplined by jehovah so that we may not become condemned with the world
33  consequently my brothers when you come together to eat it wait for one another
34  if anyone is hungry let him eat at home so that when you come together it is not for judgment
but as for the remaining matters i will put them in order when i get there
8  now concerning food offered to idols we know we all have knowledge
knowledge puffs up but love builds up
2  if anyone thinks he knows something he does not yet know it as he should know it
3  but if anyone loves god this one is known by him
4  now concerning the eating of food offered to idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no god but one
5  for even though there are socalled gods whether in heaven or on earth just as there are many gods and many lords
6  there is actually to us one god the father from whom all things are and we for him and there is one lord jesus christ through whom all things are and we through him
7  however not all have this knowledge
but some because of their former association with the idol eat food as something sacrificed to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled
8  but food will not bring us nearer to god we are no worse off if we do not eat nor better off if we eat
9  but keep watching that your right to choose does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak
10  for if anyone should see you who have knowledge having a meal in an idol temple will not the conscience of that one who is weak be emboldened to the point of eating food offered to idols
11  so by your knowledge the man who is weak is being ruined your brother for whose sake christ died
12  when you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience you are sinning against christ
13  that is why if food makes my brother stumble i will never again eat meat at all so that i will not make my brother stumble
16  now concerning the collection for the holy ones you may follow the directions i gave to the congregations of gala πtia
2  on the first day of every week each of you should set something aside according to his own means so that collections will not take place when i arrive
3  but when i get there i will send the men you approve of in your letters to take your kind gift to jerusalem
4  however if it seems advisable for me to go there also they will go there with me
5  but i will come to you when i have gone through macedo πnia for i will be going through macedo πnia
6  and perhaps i will stay or even spend the winter with you so that you may accompany me partway to where i may be going
7  for i do not want to see you now just in passing since i hope to spend some time with you if jehovah permits
8  but i am remaining in eph πesus until the festival of pentecost
9  because a large door that leads to activity has been opened to me but there are many opposers
10  now if timothy arrives make sure that he has nothing to fear while among you for he is performing the work of jehovah just as i am
11  therefore let no one look down on him
send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am waiting for him together with the brothers
12  now concerning apol πlos our brother i strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers
it was not his intention to come now but he will come when he has the opportunity
13  stay awake stand firm in the faith carry on in a manly way grow mighty
14  let everything you do be done with love
15  now i urge you brothers you know that the household of steph πanas is the firstfruits of acha πia and that they devoted themselves to ministering to the holy ones
16  may you also keep submitting yourselves to people like that and to all those cooperating and working hard
17  but i rejoice over the presence of steph πanas and fortuna πtus and acha πicus because they have made up for your not being here
18  for they have refreshed my spirit and yours
therefore give recognition to men of that sort
19  the congregations of asia send you their greetings
aq πuila and pris πca together with the congregation that is in their house greet you heartily in the lord
20  all the brothers greet you
greet one another with a holy kiss
21  here is my greeting pauls in my own hand
22  if anyone has no affection for the lord let him be accursed
o our lord come
23  may the undeserved kindness of the lord jesus be with you
24  may my love be with all of you in union with christ jesus
9  am i not free am i not an apostle have i not seen jesus our lord are you not my work in the lord
2  even if i am not an apostle to others i most certainly am to you for you are the seal confirming my apostleship in the lord
3  my defense to those who examine me is as follows
4  we have the right to eat and drink do we not
5  we have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife as the rest of the apostles and the lords brothers and ce πphas do we not
6  or is it only bar πnabas and i who do not have the right to refrain from working for a living
7  what soldier ever serves at his own expense who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit or who shepherds a flock and does not partake of some of the milk of the flock
8  am i saying these things from a human viewpoint or does not the law also say these things
9  for it is written in the law of moses you must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain
is it bulls that god is concerned about
10  or is it actually for our sakes that he says it it was really written for our sakes because the man who plows and the man who threshes ought to do so in the hope of receiving a share
11  if we have sown spiritual things among you is it too much if we reap material support from you
12  if other men have this rightful claim over you do we not have it much more so nevertheless we have not made use of this right but we are enduring all things so that we might not in any way hinder the good news about the christ
13  do you not know that the men performing sacred duties eat the things of the temple and that those regularly serving at the altar receive a share from the altar
14  in this way too the lord commanded for those proclaiming the good news to live by means of the good news
15  but i have not made use of a single one of these provisions
indeed i have not written these things so that this would be done for me for it would be better to die thanno man will take away my grounds for boasting
16  now if i am declaring the good news it is no reason for me to boast for necessity is laid upon me
really woe to me if i do not declare the good news
17  if i do this willingly i have a reward but even if i do it against my will i still have a stewardship entrusted to me
18  what then is my reward that when i declare the good news i may offer the good news without cost to avoid abusing my authority in the good news
19  for though i am free from all people i have made myself the slave to all so that i may gain as many people as possible
20  to the jews i became as a jew in order to gain jews to those under law i became as under law though i myself am not under law in order to gain those under law
21  to those without law i became as without law although i am not without law toward god but under law toward christ in order to gain those without law
22  to the weak i became weak in order to gain the weak
i have become all things to people of all sorts so that i might by all possible means save some
23  but i do all things for the sake of the good news in order to share it with others
24  do you not know that the runners in a race all run but only one receives the prize run in such a way that you may win it
25  now everyone competing in a contest exercises selfcontrol in all things
of course they do it to receive a crown that can perish but we one that does not perish
26  therefore the way i am running is not aimlessly the way i am aiming my blows is so as not to be striking the air
27  but i pummel my body and lead it as a slave so that after i have preached to others i myself should not become disapproved somehow
7  now concerning the things about which you wrote it is better for a man not to touch a woman
2  but because of the prevalence of sexual immorality let each man have his own wife and each woman have her own husband
3  let the husband give to his wife her due and let the wife also do likewise to her husband
4  the wife does not have authority over her own body but her husband does likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but his wife does
5  do not deprive each other except by mutual consent for an appointed time so that you may devote time to prayer and may come together again in order that satan may not keep tempting you for your lack of selfcontrol
6  however i say this by way of concession not as a command
7  but i wish all men were as i am
nevertheless each one has his own gift from god one in this way another in that way
8  now i say to those who are unmarried and to the widows that it is better for them if they remain as i am
9  but if they do not have selfcontrol let them marry for it is better to marry than to be inflamed with passion
10  to the married people i give instructions not i but the lord that a wife should not separate from her husband
11  but if she does separate let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled with her husband and a husband should not leave his wife
12  but to the others i say yes i not the lord if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is agreeable to staying with him let him not leave her
13  and if a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is agreeable to staying with her let her not leave her husband
14  for the unbelieving husband is sanctified in relation to his wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in relation to the brother otherwise your children would be unclean but now they are holy
15  but if the unbelieving one chooses to depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not bound under such circumstances but god has called you to peace
16  for wife how do you know whether you will save your husband or husband how do you know whether you will save your wife
17  nevertheless just as jehovah has given each one a portion let each one so walk as god has called him
and so i give this directive in all the congregations
18  was any man already circumcised when he was called let him not undo his circumcision
has any man been called while uncircumcised let him not get circumcised
19  circumcision means nothing and uncircumcision means nothing what means something is the observing of gods commandments
20  in whatever state each one was called let him remain in it
21  were you called when a slave do not let it concern you but if you can become free then seize the opportunity
22  for anyone who was called in the lord when a slave is the lords freedman likewise anyone who was called when a freeman is a slave of christ
23  you were bought with a price stop becoming slaves of men
24  in whatever state each one was called brothers let him remain in it before god
25  now concerning virgins i have no command from the lord but i give my opinion as one who had mercy shown him by the lord to be faithful
26  therefore i think that it is best for a man to continue as he is in view of the present difficulty
27  are you bound to a wife stop seeking a release
are you freed from a wife stop seeking a wife
28  but even if you did marry you would commit no sin
and if a virgin married such a person would commit no sin
however those who do will have tribulation in their flesh
but i am trying to spare you
29  moreover this i say brothers the time left is reduced
from now on let those who have wives be as though they had none
30  and those who weep as those who do not weep and those who rejoice as those who do not rejoice and those who buy as those who do not possess
31  and those making use of the world as those not using it to the full for the scene of this world is changing
32  indeed i want you to be free from anxiety
the unmarried man is anxious for the things of the lord how he may gain the lords approval
33  but the married man is anxious for the things of the world how he may gain the approval of his wife
34  and he is divided
further the unmarried woman as well as the virgin is anxious for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in her body and in her spirit
however the married woman is anxious for the things of the world how she may gain the approval of her husband
35  but i am saying this for your personal advantage not to restrict you but to move you to what is appropriate and to constant devotion to the lord without distraction
36  but if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly by remaining unmarried and if he is past the bloom of youth then this is what should take place let him do what he wants he does not sin
let them marry
37  but if anyone stands settled in his heart and has no necessity but has authority over his own will and has made the decision in his own heart to remain unmarried he will do well
38  so also whoever marries does well but whoever does not marry will do better
39  a wife is bound as long as her husband is alive
but if her husband should fall asleep in death she is free to be married to whomever she wants only in the lord
40  but in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is and i certainly think i also have gods spirit
6  does any one of you who has a dispute with another dare to go to court before unrighteous men and not before the holy ones
2  or do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world and if the world is to be judged by you are you not competent to try very trivial matters
3  do you not know that we will judge angels then why not matters of this life
4  if then you do have matters of this life to be tried is it the men looked down on in the congregation whom you assign as judges
5  i am speaking to move you to shame
is there not one wise man among you who is able to judge between his brothers
6  instead brother goes to court against brother and before unbelievers at that
7  really it is already a defeat for you when you have lawsuits with one another
why not rather let yourselves be wronged why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded
8  instead you wrong and defraud and your brothers at that
9  or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit gods kingdom do not be misled
those who are sexually immoral idolaters adulterers men who submit to homosexual acts men who practice homosexuality
10  thieves greedy people drunkards revilers and extortioners will not inherit gods kingdom
11  and yet that is what some of you were
but you have been washed clean you have been sanctified you have been declared righteous in the name of the lord jesus christ and with the spirit of our god
12  all things are lawful for me but not all things are advantageous
all things are lawful for me but i will not let myself be controlled by anything
13  food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food but god will bring both of them to nothing
the body is not for sexual immorality but for the lord and the lord is for the body
14  but god raised up the lord and will also raise us up out of death through his power
15  do you not know that your bodies are members of christ should i then take the members of the christ away and join them to a prostitute by no means
16  do you not know that anyone who is joined to a prostitute is one body with her for the two says he will be one flesh
17  but whoever is joined to the lord is one with him in spirit
18  flee from sexual immorality every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body
19  do you not know that your body is the temple of the holy spirit within you which you have from god also you do not belong to yourselves
20  for you were bought with a price
by all means glorify god in your body
13  if i speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love i have become a clanging gong or a clashing cymbal
2  and if i have the gift of prophecy and understand all the sacred secrets and all knowledge and if i have all the faith so as to move mountains but do not have love i am nothing
3  and if i give all my belongings to feed others and if i hand over my body so that i may boast but do not have love i do not benefit at all
4  love is patient and kind
love is not jealous
it does not brag does not get puffed up
5  does not behave indecently does not look for its own interests does not become provoked
it does not keep account of the injury
6  it does not rejoice over unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth
7  it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things
8  love never fails
but if there are gifts of prophecy they will be done away with if there are tongues they will cease if there is knowledge it will be done away with
9  for we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially
10  but when what is complete comes what is partial will be done away with
11  when i was a child i used to speak as a child to think as a child to reason as a child but now that i have become a man i have done away with the traits of a child
12  for now we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror but then it will be facetoface
at present i know partially but then i will know accurately just as i am accurately known
13  now however these three remain faith hope love but the greatest of these is love
14  pursue love yet keep striving for the spiritual gifts but preferably that you may prophesy
2  for the one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to god for no one listens but he speaks sacred secrets by the spirit
3  however the one who prophesies builds up and encourages and consoles men by his speech
4  the one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself but the one who prophesies builds up a congregation
5  now i would like for all of you to speak in tongues but i prefer that you prophesy
indeed the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues unless he interprets so that the congregation may be built up
6  but at this time brothers if i should come speaking to you in tongues what good would i do you unless i spoke to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching
7  it is the same with the inanimate things that produce sound whether a flute or a harp
unless there is an interval to the tones how can what is being played on the flute or on the harp be recognized
8  for if the trumpet sounds an indistinct call who will get ready for battle
9  in the same way unless you with the tongue use speech that is easily understood how will anyone know what is being said you will in fact be speaking into the air
10  it may be that there are many kinds of speech in the world and yet no kind is without meaning
11  for if i do not understand the sense of the speech i will be a foreigner to the one speaking and the one speaking will be a foreigner to me
12  so also with you since you eagerly desire the gifts of the spirit seek to abound in gifts that will build up the congregation
13  therefore let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret
14  for if i am praying in a tongue it is my gift of the spirit that is praying but my mind is unproductive
15  what is to be done then i will pray with the gift of the spirit but i will also pray with my mind
i will sing praise with the gift of the spirit but i will also sing praise with my mind
16  otherwise if you offer praise with a gift of the spirit how will the ordinary person in your midst say amen to your giving of thanks since he does not know what you are saying
17  true you are giving thanks in a fine way but the other man is not being built up
18  i thank god that i speak in more tongues than all of you do
19  nevertheless in a congregation i would rather speak five words with my mind that i might also instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue
20  brothers do not become young children in your understanding but be young children as to badness and become fullgrown in your understanding
21  in the law it is written with the tongues of foreigners and with the lips of strangers i will speak to this people and even then they will refuse to listen to me says jehovah
22  therefore tongues are not a sign for the believers but for the unbelievers whereas prophecy is not for the unbelievers but for the believers
23  so if the whole congregation comes together to one place and they all speak in tongues but ordinary people or unbelievers come in will they not say that you have lost your minds
24  but if you are all prophesying and an unbeliever or an ordinary person comes in he will be reproved and closely examined by them all
25  the secrets of his heart then become evident so that he will fall facedown and worship god declaring god is really among you
26  what is to be done then brothers when you come together one has a psalm another has a teaching another has a revelation another has a tongue and another has an interpretation
let all things take place for building up
27  and if someone speaks in a tongue let it be limited to two or three at the most and in turns and someone must interpret
28  but if there is no interpreter he must keep silent in the congregation and speak to himself and to god
29  let two or three prophets speak and let the others discern the meaning
30  but if another one receives a revelation while sitting there let the first speaker keep silent
31  for you can all prophesy one at a time so that all may learn and all may be encouraged
32  and gifts of the spirit of the prophets are to be controlled by the prophets
33  for god is a god not of disorder but of peace
as in all the congregations of the holy ones
34  let the women keep silent in the congregations for it is not permitted for them to speak
rather let them be in subjection as the law also says
35  if they want to learn something let them ask their husbands at home for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the congregation
36  was it from you that the word of god originated or did it reach only as far as you
37  if anyone thinks he is a prophet or is gifted with the spirit he must acknowledge that the things i am writing to you are the lords commandment
38  but if anyone disregards this he will be disregarded
39  so my brothers keep striving to prophesy and yet do not forbid the speaking in tongues
40  but let all things take place decently and by arrangement
5  actually sexual immorality is reported among you and such immorality as is not even found among the nationsof a man living with his fathers wife
2  and are you proud of it should you not rather mourn so that the man who committed this deed should be taken away from your midst
3  although absent in body i am present in spirit and i have already judged the man who has done this as if i were actually with you
4  when you are gathered together in the name of our lord jesus and knowing that i am with you in spirit along with the power of our lord jesus
5  you must hand such a man over to satan for the destruction of the flesh so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord
6  your boasting is not good
do you not know that a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough
7  clear away the old leaven so that you may be a new batch inasmuch as you are free from ferment
for indeed christ our passover lamb has been sacrificed
8  so then let us keep the festival not with old leaven nor with leaven of badness and wickedness but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
9  in my letter i wrote you to stop keeping company with sexually immoral people
10  not meaning entirely with the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people or extortioners or idolaters
otherwise you would actually have to get out of the world
11  but now i am writing you to stop keeping company with anyone called a brother who is sexually immoral or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner not even eating with such a man
12  for what do i have to do with judging those outside do you not judge those inside
13  while god judges those outside remove the wicked person from among yourselves
15  now i remind you brothers of the good news that i declared to you which you also accepted and for which you have taken your stand
2  through it you are also being saved if you hold firmly to the good news i declared to you unless you became believers for nothing
3  for among the first things i handed on to you was what i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
4  and that he was buried yes that he was raised up on the third day according to the scriptures
5  and that he appeared to ce πphas and then to the twelve
6  after that he appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time most of whom are still with us though some have fallen asleep in death
7  after that he appeared to james then to all the apostles
8  but last of all he appeared also to me as if to one born prematurely
9  for i am the least of the apostles and i am not worthy of being called an apostle because i persecuted the congregation of god
10  but by gods undeserved kindness i am what i am
and his undeserved kindness to me was not in vain but i labored more than all of them yet it was not i but the undeserved kindness of god that is with me
11  whether then it is i or they this is the way we preach and this is the way you believed
12  now if it is being preached that christ has been raised from the dead how is it that some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead
13  if indeed there is no resurrection of the dead then christ has not been raised up
14  but if christ has not been raised up our preaching is certainly in vain and your faith is also in vain
15  moreover we are also found to be false witnesses of god because we have given witness against god by saying that he raised up the christ whom he did not raise up if the dead are really not to be raised up
16  for if the dead are not to be raised up neither has christ been raised up
17  further if christ has not been raised up your faith is useless you remain in your sins
18  then also those who have fallen asleep in death in union with christ have perished
19  if in this life only we have hoped in christ we are to be pitied more than anyone
20  but now christ has been raised from the dead the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death
21  for since death came through a man resurrection of the dead also comes through a man
22  for just as in adam all are dying so also in the christ all will be made alive
23  but each one in his own proper order christ the firstfruits afterward those who belong to the christ during his presence
24  next the end when he hands over the kingdom to his god and father when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power
25  for he must rule as king until god has put all enemies under his feet
26  and the last enemy death is to be brought to nothing
27  for god subjected all things under his feet
but when he says that all things have been subjected it is evident that this does not include the one who subjected all things to him
28  but when all things will have been subjected to him then the son himself will also subject himself to the one who subjected all things to him that god may be all things to everyone
29  otherwise what will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of being dead ones if the dead are not to be raised up at all why are they also being baptized for the purpose of being such
30  why are we also in danger every hour
31  daily i face death
this is as sure as my exultation over you brothers which i have in christ jesus our lord
32  if like other men i have fought with wild beasts at eph πesus of what good is it to me if the dead are not to be raised up let us eat and drink for tomorrow we are to die
33  do not be misled
bad associations spoil useful habits
34  come to your senses in a righteous way and do not practice sin for some have no knowledge of god
i am speaking to move you to shame
35  nevertheless someone will say how are the dead to be raised up yes with what sort of body are they coming
36  you unreasonable person what you sow is not made alive unless first it dies
37  and as for what you sow you sow not the body that will develop but just a bare grain whether of wheat or of some other kind of seed
38  but god gives it a body just as it has pleased him and gives to each of the seeds its own body
39  not all flesh is the same flesh but there is one of mankind there is another flesh of cattle another flesh of birds and another of fish
40  and there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort
41  the glory of the sun is one sort and the glory of the moon is another and the glory of the stars is another in fact one star differs from another star in glory
42  so it is with the resurrection of the dead
it is sown in corruption it is raised up in incorruption
43  it is sown in dishonor it is raised up in glory
it is sown in weakness it is raised up in power
44  it is sown a physical body it is raised up a spiritual body
if there is a physical body there is also a spiritual one
45  so it is written the first man adam became a living person
the last adam became a lifegiving spirit
46  however what is spiritual is not first
what is physical is first and afterward what is spiritual
47  the first man is from the earth and made of dust the second man is from heaven
48  like the one made of dust so too are those made of dust and like the heavenly one so too are those who are heavenly
49  and just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust we will bear also the image of the heavenly one
50  but i tell you this brothers that flesh and blood cannot inherit gods kingdom nor does corruption inherit incorruption
51  look i tell you a sacred secret we will not all fall asleep in death but we will all be changed
52  in a moment in the blink of an eye during the last trumpet
for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised up incorruptible and we will be changed
53  for this which is corruptible must put on incorruption and this which is mortal must put on immortality
54  but when this which is corruptible puts on incorruption and this which is mortal puts on immortality then the saying that is written will take place death is swallowed up forever
55  death where is your victory death where is your sting
56  the sting producing death is sin and the power for sin is the law
57  but thanks to god for he gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ
58  therefore my beloved brothers be steadfast immovable always having plenty to do in the work of the lord knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the lord
1  paul called to be an apostle of christ jesus by gods will and sos πthenes our brother
2  to the congregation of god that is in corinth to you who have been sanctified in union with christ jesus called to be holy ones together with all those everywhere who are calling on the name of our lord jesus christ their lord and ours
3  may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
4  i always thank my god for you in view of the undeserved kindness of god given to you in christ jesus
5  because in everything you have been enriched in him in full ability to speak and in full knowledge
6  just as the witness about the christ has been made firm among you
7  so that you do not lack in any gift at all while you are eagerly waiting for the revelation of our lord jesus christ
8  he will also make you firm to the end so that you may be open to no accusation in the day of our lord jesus christ
9  god is faithful by whom you were called into fellowship with his son jesus christ our lord
10  now i urge you brothers through the name of our lord jesus christ that you should all speak in agreement and that there should be no divisions among you but that you may be completely united in the same mind and in the same line of thought
11  for some from the house of chlo πe have informed me regarding you my brothers that there are dissensions among you
12  what i mean is this that each one of you says i belong to paul but i to apol πlos but i to ce πphas but i to christ
13  is the christ divided paul was not executed on the stake for you was he or were you baptized in the name of paul
14  i thank god that i baptized none of you except cris πpus and ga πius
15  so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name
16  yes i also baptized the household of steph πanas
as for the rest i do not know whether i baptized anyone else
17  for christ sent me not to baptize but to declare the good news and not with wisdom of speech so that the torture stake of the christ should not be made useless
18  for the speech about the torture stake is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is gods power
19  for it is written i will make the wisdom of the wise men perish and the intelligence of the intellectuals i will reject
20  where is the wise man where is the scribe where is the debater of this system of things has not god made the wisdom of the world foolish
21  for since in the wisdom of god the world did not get to know god through its wisdom god was pleased through the foolishness of what is preached to save those believing
22  for the jews ask for signs and the greeks look for wisdom
23  but we preach christ executed on the stake to the jews a cause for stumbling but to the nations foolishness
24  however to those who are called both jews and greeks christ is the power of god and the wisdom of god
25  because a foolish thing of god is wiser than men and a weak thing of god is stronger than men
26  for you see his calling of you brothers that there are not many wise in a fleshly way not many powerful not many of noble birth
27  but god chose the foolish things of the world to put the wise men to shame and god chose the weak things of the world to put the strong things to shame
28  and god chose the insignificant things of the world and the things looked down on the things that are not to bring to nothing the things that are
29  so that no one might boast in the sight of god
30  but it is due to him that you are in union with christ jesus who has become to us wisdom from god also righteousness and sanctification and release by ransom
31  so that it may be just as it is written the one who boasts let him boast in jehovah
2  so when i came to you brothers i did not come with extravagant speech or wisdom declaring the sacred secret of god to you
2  for i decided not to know anything among you except jesus christ and him executed on the stake
3  and i came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling
4  and my speech and what i preached were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of spirit and power
5  so that your faith might be not in mens wisdom but in gods power
6  now we speak wisdom among those who are mature but not the wisdom of this system of things nor that of the rulers of this system of things who are to come to nothing
7  but we speak gods wisdom in a sacred secret the hidden wisdom which god foreordained before the systems of things for our glory
8  it is this wisdom that none of the rulers of this system of things came to know for if they had known it they would not have executed the glorious lord
9  but just as it is written eye has not seen and ear has not heard nor have there been conceived in the heart of man the things that god has prepared for those who love him
10  for it is to us god has revealed them through his spirit for the spirit searches into all things even the deep things of god
11  for who among men knows the things of a man except the mans spirit within him so too no one has come to know the things of god except the spirit of god
12  now we received not the spirit of the world but the spirit that is from god so that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by god
13  these things we also speak not with words taught by human wisdom but with those taught by the spirit as we explain spiritual matters with spiritual words
14  but a physical man does not accept the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him and he cannot get to know them because they are examined spiritually
15  however the spiritual man examines all things but he himself is not examined by any man
16  for who has come to know the mind of jehovah so that he may instruct him but we do have the mind of christ
3  so brothers i was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men but as to fleshly men as to infants in christ
2  i fed you milk not solid food for you were not yet strong enough
in fact neither are you strong enough now
3  for you are still fleshly
since there are jealousy and strife among you are you not fleshly and are you not walking as men do
4  for when one says i belong to paul but another says i to apol πlos are you not acting like mere men
5  what then is apol πlos yes what is paul ministers through whom you became believers just as the lord granted each one
6  i planted apol πlos watered but god kept making it grow
7  so that neither is the one who plants anything nor is the one who waters but god who makes it grow
8  now the one who plants and the one who waters are one but each person will receive his own reward according to his own work
9  for we are gods fellow workers
you are gods field under cultivation gods building
10  according to the undeserved kindness of god that was given to me i laid a foundation as a skilled master builder but someone else is building on it
but let each one keep watching how he is building on it
11  for no one can lay any other foundation than what is laid which is jesus christ
12  now if anyone builds on the foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay or straw
13  each ones work will be shown for what it is for the day will show it up because it will be revealed by means of fire and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one has built
14  if anyones work that he has built on it remains he will receive a reward
15  if anyones work is burned up he will suffer loss but he himself will be saved yet if so it will be as through fire
16  do you not know that you yourselves are gods temple and that the spirit of god dwells in you
17  if anyone destroys the temple of god god will destroy him for the temple of god is holy and you are that temple
18  let no one deceive himself if anyone among you thinks he is wise in this system of things let him become a fool so that he may become wise
19  for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he catches the wise in their own cunning
20  and again jehovah knows that the reasonings of the wise men are futile
21  so let no one boast in men for all things belong to you
22  whether paul or apol πlos or ce πphas or the world or life or death or things now here or things to come all things belong to you
23  in turn you belong to christ christ in turn belongs to god
12  now concerning the spiritual gifts brothers i do not want you to be uninformed
2  you know that when you were people of the nations you were influenced and led astray to those voiceless idols following wherever they might lead you
3  now i would have you know that nobody when speaking by gods spirit says jesus is accursed and nobody can say jesus is lord except by holy spirit
4  now there are different gifts but there is the same spirit
5  and there are different ministries and yet there is the same lord
6  and there are different activities and yet it is the same god who performs them all in everyone
7  but the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for a beneficial purpose
8  for to one is given speech of wisdom through the spirit to another speech of knowledge according to the same spirit
9  to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by that one spirit
10  to yet another operations of powerful works to another prophesying to another discernment of inspired expressions to another different tongues and to another interpretation of tongues
11  but all these operations are performed by the very same spirit distributing to each one respectively just as it wills
12  for just as the body is one but has many members and all the members of that body although many are one body so too is the christ
13  for by one spirit we were all baptized into one body whether jews or greeks whether slaves or free and we were all made to drink one spirit
14  for indeed the body is made up not of one member but of many
15  if the foot should say because i am not a hand i am no part of the body that does not make it no part of the body
16  and if the ear should say because i am not an eye i am no part of the body that does not make it no part of the body
17  if the whole body were an eye where would the sense of hearing be if it were all hearing where would the sense of smell be
18  but now god has arranged each of the body members just as he pleased
19  if they were all the same member where would the body be
20  but now they are many members yet one body
21  the eye cannot say to the hand i do not need you or again the head cannot say to the feet i do not need you
22  on the contrary the members of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary
23  and the parts of the body that we think to be less honorable we surround with greater honor so our unseemly parts are treated with greater modesty
24  whereas our attractive parts do not need anything
nevertheless god has so composed the body giving greater honor to the part that had a lack
25  so that there should be no division in the body but its members should have mutual concern for one another
26  if one member suffers all the other members suffer with it or if a member is glorified all the other members rejoice with it
27  now you are christs body and each of you individually is a member
28  and god has assigned the respective ones in the congregation first apostles second prophets third teachers then powerful works then gifts of healings helpful services abilities to direct different tongues
29  not all are apostles are they not all are prophets are they not all are teachers are they not all perform powerful works do they
30  not all have gifts of healings do they not all speak in tongues do they not all are interpreters are they
31  but keep striving for the greater gifts
and yet i will show you a surpassing way
