10  king ahasueʹrus imposed forced labor on the land and the islands of the sea
2  and all his powerful and mighty accomplishments as well as the detailed account of morʹdecais greatness to which the king exalted him are they not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of meʹdia and persia
3  for morʹdecai the jew was second only to king ahasueʹrus
he was great among the jews and respected by the multitude of his brothers working for the good of his people and advocating the welfare of all their descendants
4  when morʹdecai learned of everything that had been done he ripped his garments apart and put on sackcloth and ashes
then he went out into the middle of the city crying out loudly and bitterly
2  he went only as far as the kings gate for no one was to enter the kings gate wearing sackcloth
3  and in every province where the kings word and his decree reached there was great mourning among the jews along with fasting and weeping and wailing
many were lying down in sackcloth and ashes
4  when esthers female attendants and her eunuchs came in and told her the queen was deeply distressed
then she sent garments for morʹdecai to wear instead of his sackcloth but he refused them
5  at this esther summoned haʹthach one of the kings eunuchs whom he had appointed to serve her and she ordered him to find out from morʹdecai what this meant and what was happening
6  so haʹthach went out to morʹdecai in the public square of the city in front of the kings gate
7  morʹdecai told him about everything that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that haʹman had promised to pay to the kings treasury for the jews to be destroyed
8  he also gave him a copy of the written decree that had been issued in shuʹshan for their annihilation
he was to show it to esther and explain it to her and instruct her to go in to the king to beg for his favor and to plead directly with him in behalf of her people
9  haʹthach came back and told esther what morʹdecai had said
10  esther replied to haʹthach with instructions to tell morʹdecai
11  all the kings servants and the people of the kings provinces are aware that if any man or woman goes into the kings inner courtyard without being summoned there is only one law that applies he is to be put to death he may live only if the king holds out to him the golden scepter
and i have not been summoned to the king now for 30 days
12  when morʹdecai was told what esther had said
13  he replied to esther do not imagine that because you are in the kings household you are any more likely to escape than all the other jews
14  for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance will come to the jews from another source but you and your fathers house will perish
and who knows whether it is for a time like this that you have attained to your royal status
15  then esther replied to morʹdecai
16  go gather all the jews who are found in shuʹshan and fast in my behalf
do not eat or drink for three days night and day
i along with my female attendants will also fast
i will go in to the king which is against the law and if i am to perish i will perish
17  so morʹdecai went his way and did all that esther had instructed him to do
8  on that day king ahasueʹrus gave the house of haʹman the enemy of the jews to queen esther and morʹdecai came in before the king because esther had revealed how he was related to her
2  then the king removed his signet ring that he had taken away from haʹman and gave it to morʹdecai
and esther put morʹdecai in charge of the house of haʹman
3  moreover esther spoke again to the king
she fell down at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to undo the harm done by haʹman the agʹagite and his scheme against the jews
4  the king held the golden scepter out to esther at which esther rose and stood before the king
5  she said if it pleases the king and if i have his favor and if it seems proper to the king and i am pleasing in his eyes let an order be written to annul the documents of that schemer haʹman the son of hammedaʹtha the agʹagite which he wrote to destroy the jews in all the kings provinces
6  for how can i bear to look upon the disaster that will come upon my people and how can i bear to see the destruction of my relatives
7  so king ahasueʹrus said to queen esther and to morʹdecai the jew look i have given the house of haʹman to esther and have had him hanged on the stake because of his plot to attack the jews
8  you may now write in the kings name whatever you see fit in behalf of the jews and seal it with the kings signet ring for a decree that is written in the kings name and sealed with the kings signet ring cannot be revoked
9  so the secretaries of the king were summoned at that time in the third month that is the month of siʹvan on the 23rd day and they wrote all that morʹdecai commanded to the jews as well as to the satraps the governors and the princes of the provinces from inʹdia to ethioʹpia 127 provinces to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language and to the jews in their own script and language
10  he wrote it in the name of king ahasueʹrus and sealed it with the kings signet ring and sent the written documents by the hand of couriers on horses they rode on swift posthorses bred for royal service
11  in these documents the king granted permission to the jews in all the different cities to gather together and defend their lives and to annihilate kill and destroy any forces of any people or province that might attack them including women and children and to seize their possessions
12  this was to occur on the same day in all the provinces of king ahasueʹrus on the 13th day of the 12th month that is the month of aʹdar
13  the text of the document was to be issued as law throughout all the provinces
it was to be proclaimed to all the peoples so that the jews would be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies
14  the couriers riding the posthorses used in the royal service went out urgently and speedily at the kings order
the law was also issued in shuʹshan the citadel
15  now morʹdecai left the kings presence in royal apparel of blue and white wearing a great golden crown and a finefabric cloak of purple wool
and the city of shuʹshan shouted for joy
16  for the jews there was relief and rejoicing and exultation and honor
17  and in all the provinces and all the cities wherever the decree of the king and his law reached the jews were rejoicing and exulting holding banquets and celebrations
many of the peoples of the land were declaring themselves jews for the dread of the jews had fallen upon them
9  on the 13th day of the 12th month that is the month of aʹdar when the kings word and his law were to be carried out on the day when the enemies of the jews hoped to overpower them the opposite happened and the jews defeated those who hated them
2  the jews gathered together in their cities in all the provinces of king ahasueʹrus to lay hands on those seeking to harm them and not a man could stand against them for the dread of them had fallen upon all the peoples
3  and all the princes of the provinces the satraps the governors and those handling the business of the king were supporting the jews for they were in fear of morʹdecai
4  morʹdecai had become powerful in the kings house and his fame was spreading throughout all the provinces because morʹdecai was steadily growing more powerful
5  the jews struck down all their enemies with the sword killing and destroying them they did whatever they wanted to those hating them
6  in shuʹshan the citadel the jews killed and destroyed 500 men
7  also they killed parshandaʹtha dalʹphon aspaʹtha
8  poraʹtha adaʹlia aridaʹtha
9  parmashʹta arʹisai arʹidai and vaizaʹtha
10  the ten sons of haʹman the son of hammedaʹtha the enemy of the jews
but after they killed them they did not seize any plunder
11  on that day the number of those killed in shuʹshan the citadel was reported to the king
12  the king said to queen esther in shuʹshan the citadel the jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and the ten sons of haʹman
what then have they done in the rest of the kings provinces what is your petition now it will be granted you
and what is your further request it will be done
13  esther replied if it pleases the king let the jews who are in shuʹshan be permitted to act tomorrow also according to todays law and let the ten sons of haʹman be hanged on the stake
14  so the king gave orders for that to be done
a law was issued in shuʹshan and the ten sons of haʹman were hanged
15  the jews in shuʹshan gathered together again on the 14th day of the month of aʹdar and killed 300 men in shuʹshan but they did not seize any plunder
16  the rest of the jews in the provinces of the king also gathered together and defended their lives
they got rid of their enemies killing 75000 of those who hated them but they did not seize any plunder
17  that was on the 13th day of the month of aʹdar and they rested on the 14th day and made it a day of feasting and of rejoicing
18  the jews in shuʹshan gathered together on the 13th day and on the 14th day and they rested on the 15th day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing
19  that is why the rural jews inhabiting the cities of the outlying districts made the 14th day of the month of aʹdar a day of rejoicing and feasting a day of celebration and a time to send portions of food to one another
20  morʹdecai recorded these events and sent official letters to all the jews in all the provinces of king ahasueʹrus both near and far
21  he instructed them to observe the 14th day of the month of aʹdar as well as the 15th day each and every year
22  because on those days the jews rested from their enemies and in that month their grief was changed to rejoicing and their mourning to a day of celebration
they were to observe them as days of feasting and rejoicing and as a time to send portions of food to one another and gifts to the poor
23  and the jews agreed to continue the celebration that they had started and to do what morʹdecai wrote to them
24  for haʹman the son of hammedaʹtha the agʹagite the enemy of all the jews had schemed against the jews to destroy them and he had cast pur that is the lot to throw them into a panic and to destroy them
25  but when esther came in before the king he gave orders in writing let his evil scheme against the jews come back on his own head and they hanged him and his sons on the stake
26  that is why they called these days puʹrim after the name of the pur
therefore because of all that was written in this letter and what they saw concerning this matter and what had come upon them
27  the jews obligated themselves and their descendants and all those joining them to celebrate these two days without fail and to carry out what was written concerning them at the appointed time each and every year
28  these days were to be remembered and observed in every generation by each family each province and each city and these days of puʹrim should not cease among the jews and their commemoration should not come to an end among their descendants
29  then queen esther the daughter of abʹihail and morʹdecai the jew wrote with full authority to confirm a second letter about puʹrim
30  he sent official letters to all the jews in the 127 provinces the realm of ahasueʹrus in words of peace and truth
31  to confirm the observance of the days of puʹrim at their appointed times just as morʹdecai the jew and queen esther had instructed them to do and just as they had obligated themselves and their descendants to carry out including the fasting and supplication
32  and the command of esther confirmed these matters concerning puʹrim and it was recorded in a book
7  so the king and haʹman came in to queen esthers banquet
2  the king said to esther again on the second day during the banquet of wine what is your petition queen esther it will be granted you
and what is your request even to the half of my kingdom it will be done
3  queen esther answered if i have found favor with you o king and if it pleases the king let my life be granted as my petition and my people as my request
4  for we have been sold i and my people to be annihilated killed and destroyed
if we had simply been sold as male and female slaves i would have kept silent
but the distress is not proper for it will be damaging to the king
5  king ahasueʹrus then said to queen esther who is this and where is the man who has dared to do such a thing
6  esther said the adversary and enemy is this evil haʹman
haʹman became terrified because of the king and the queen
7  the king rose up in a rage from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden but haʹman stood up to plead with queen esther for his life for he realized that the king was determined to punish him
8  the king returned from the palace garden to the house of the wine banquet and saw that haʹman had thrown himself on the couch where esther was
the king exclaimed is he also going to rape the queen in my own house as soon as these words left the kings mouth they covered haʹmans face
9  harboʹna one of the kings court officials now said haʹman also prepared a stake for morʹdecai whose report saved the king
it is standing at haʹmans house 50 cubits high
at that the king said hang him on it
10  so they hanged haʹman on the stake that he had prepared for morʹdecai and the kings rage subsided
6  that night the king could not sleep
so he said to bring the book of the historical records of the times and it was read to the king
2  there it was found written what morʹdecai had reported concerning bigthaʹna and teʹresh two court officials of the king doorkeepers who had plotted to do away with king ahasueʹrus
3  the king asked what honor and recognition has been given to morʹdecai for this to this the kings personal attendants said nothing has been done for him
4  later the king said who is in the courtyard now haʹman had come into the outer courtyard of the kings house to speak to the king about having morʹdecai hanged on the stake that he had prepared for him
5  the kings attendants said to him it is haʹman standing in the courtyard
so the king said have him come in
6  when haʹman came in the king said to him what should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor haʹman said in his heart whom would the king wish to honor more than me
7  so haʹman said to the king for the man whom the king wishes to honor
8  let them bring royal attire that the king wears and a horse on which the king rides with the royal headdress on its head
9  then let the attire and the horse be put into the charge of one of the kings noble princes and they should clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor and have him ride on the horse in the public square of the city
they should call out before him this is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor
10  at once the king said to haʹman quick take the attire and the horse and do what you just said for morʹdecai the jew who is sitting in the kings gate
do not leave out anything that you have said
11  so haʹman took the attire and the horse and he clothed morʹdecai and made him ride in the public square of the city and called out before him this is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor
12  afterward morʹdecai returned to the kings gate but haʹman hurried to his house mourning with his head covered
13  when haʹman related to his wife zeʹresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him his wise men and his wife zeʹresh said to him if morʹdecai before whom you have started to fall is of jewish descent you will not prevail against him you will surely fall before him
14  while they were still speaking with him the kings court officials arrived and quickly took haʹman to the banquet that esther had made
5  on the third day esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner courtyard of the kings house opposite the kings house while the king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal house opposite the entrance
2  as soon as the king saw queen esther standing in the courtyard she gained his favor and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand
esther then approached and touched the top of the scepter
3  the king asked her what is the matter queen esther what is your request even to the half of my kingdom it will be granted you
4  esther replied if it pleases the king let the king along with haʹman come today to the banquet that i have prepared for him
5  so the king said to his men tell haʹman to come quickly as esther requests
so the king and haʹman went to the banquet that esther had prepared
6  during the banquet of wine the king said to esther what is your petition it will be granted you and what is your request even to the half of my kingdom it will be done
7  esther answered my petition and my request is
8  if i have found favor with the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to act on my request let the king and haʹman come to the banquet that i will hold for them tomorrow and tomorrow i will do as the king says
9  on that day haʹman went out joyful and with a cheerful heart
but when haʹman saw morʹdecai in the kings gate and noticed that he did not rise and tremble in his presence haʹman was filled with rage against morʹdecai
10  however haʹman restrained himself and went to his house
then he sent for his friends and zeʹresh his wife
11  haʹman boasted about his glorious wealth his many sons and how the king had promoted him and had exalted him over the princes and the servants of the king
12  haʹman added what is more queen esther invited no one else but me to accompany the king to the banquet she prepared
i am also invited tomorrow to be with her and the king
13  but all of this fails to satisfy me as long as i see morʹdecai the jew sitting in the kings gate
14  so zeʹresh his wife and all his friends said to him have a stake put up 50 cubits high
and in the morning tell the king that morʹdecai should be hanged on it
then go with the king to enjoy yourself at the banquet
this suggestion seemed good to haʹman so he had the stake put up
1  now in the days of ahasueʹrus that is the ahasueʹrus who ruled over 127 provinces from inʹdia to ethioʹpia
2  in those days when king ahasueʹrus was sitting on his royal throne in shuʹshan the citadel
3  in the third year of his reign he held a banquet for all his princes and his servants
the army of persia and meʹdia the nobles and the princes of the provinces were before him
4  and he showed them the wealth of his glorious kingdom and the grandeur and the splendor of his magnificence for many days 180 days
5  and when these days were completed the king held a banquet for seven days for all the people present in shuʹshan the citadel from the greatest to the least in the courtyard of the garden of the kings palace
6  there were linen fine cotton and blue material held fast in ropes of fine fabric purple wool in silver rings pillars of marble and couches of gold and silver on a pavement of porphyry marble pearl and black marble
7  wine was served in gold cups each cup was different from the other and the royal wine was plentiful according to the means of the king
8  the drinking was according to the rule that no one was under compulsion for the king had arranged with the officials of his palace that each should do as he pleased
9  queen vashʹti also held a banquet for the women at the royal house of king ahasueʹrus
10  on the seventh day when the kings heart was in a cheerful mood because of the wine he told mehuʹman bizʹtha harboʹna bigʹtha abagʹtha zeʹthar and carʹkas the seven court officials who were personal attendants to king ahasueʹrus
11  to bring before the king queen vashʹti wearing the royal headdress to show the peoples and the princes her beauty for she was very beautiful
12  but queen vashʹti kept refusing to come at the kings order that was conveyed through the court officials
at this the king became very angry and his rage flared up within him
13  the king then spoke to the wise men who had insight with regard to precedents for in this way the kings matter came before all those versed in law and legal cases
14  and those closest to him were carsheʹna sheʹthar admaʹtha tarʹshish meʹres marseʹna and memuʹcan seven princes of persia and meʹdia who had access to the king and who occupied the highest positions in the kingdom
15  the king asked according to law what is to be done with queen vashʹti because she has not obeyed the order of king ahasueʹrus conveyed through the court officials
16  to this memuʹcan said in the presence of the king and the princes it is not against the king alone that queen vashʹti has done wrong but against all the princes and against all the peoples in all the provinces of king ahasueʹrus
17  for what the queen did will become known by all the wives and they will despise their husbands and say king ahasueʹrus said to bring in queen vashʹti before him but she refused to come
18  this very day the princesses of persia and meʹdia who know about what the queen did will talk to all the princes of the king resulting in much contempt and indignation
19  if it seems good to the king let a royal decree be issued from him and let it be written among the laws of persia and meʹdia which cannot be repealed that vashʹti may never again come in before king ahasueʹrus and let the king confer her royal position on a woman who is better than she is
20  and when the decree of the king is heard in all his vast realm all the wives will give honor to their husbands from the greatest to the least
21  this proposal pleased the king and the princes and the king did what memuʹcan said
22  so he sent letters to all the royal provinces to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language for every husband to be master in his own house and to speak in the language of his own people
2  after these things when the rage of king ahasueʹrus had subsided he remembered what vashʹti had done and what had been decided against her
2  then the kings personal attendants said a search should be made for young beautiful virgins for the king
3  and let the king appoint commissioners in all the provinces of his realm to bring together all the beautiful young virgins to shuʹshan the citadel to the house of the women
let them be put in the care of hegʹai the kings eunuch and guardian of the women and let them be given beauty treatments
4  and the young woman who is most pleasing to the king will be queen instead of vashʹti
the suggestion was pleasing to the king and that is what he did
5  there was a certain jewish man in shuʹshan the citadel whose name was morʹdecai son of jaʹir son of shimʹei son of kish a benʹjaminite
6  who had been taken into exile from jerusalem with the people who were deported with king jeconiʹah of judah whom king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon took into exile
7  he was the guardian of hadasʹsah that is esther the daughter of his fathers brother for she had neither father nor mother
the young woman was beautifully formed and attractive in appearance and at the death of her father and her mother morʹdecai took her as his daughter
8  when the kings word and his law were proclaimed and when many young women were brought together at shuʹshan the citadel under the care of hegʹai esther was also taken to the kings house under the care of hegʹai the guardian of the women
9  now the young woman was pleasing to him and won his favor so he promptly arranged for her beauty treatments and her diet and he assigned to her seven selected young women from the kings house
he also transferred her and her young attendants to the best place in the house of the women
10  esther did not say anything about her people or her relatives for morʹdecai had instructed her not to tell anyone
11  day after day morʹdecai would walk in front of the courtyard of the house of the women to learn about esthers welfare and about what was happening to her
12  each young woman had her turn to go in to king ahasueʹrus after completing the 12month treatment that was prescribed for the women for this was the way they had to fulfill their beauty treatmentsix months with oil of myrrh and six months with balsam oil and various ointments for beauty treatment
13  then the young woman was ready to go in to the king and whatever she asked for would be given her when she went from the house of the women to the kings house
14  in the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second house of the women under the care of shaashʹgaz the kings eunuch the guardian of the concubines
she would not go to the king again unless the king had been especially pleased with her and she was requested by name
15  and when the turn came for esther the daughter of abʹihail the uncle of morʹdecai who had taken her as his daughter to go in to the king she did not request anything except what hegʹai the kings eunuch the guardian of the women recommended
all the while esther was winning the favor of everyone who saw her
16  esther was taken to king ahasueʹrus at his royal house in the tenth month that is the month of teʹbeth in the seventh year of his reign
17  and the king came to love esther more than all the other women and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins
so he put the royal headdress on her head and made her queen instead of vashʹti
18  and the king held a great banquet for all his princes and his servants the banquet of esther
he then proclaimed an amnesty for the provinces and he kept giving gifts according to the means of the king
19  now when virgins were brought together a second time morʹdecai was sitting in the kings gate
20  esther did not say anything about her relatives and her people just as morʹdecai had instructed her esther continued to do what morʹdecai said just as when she was under his care
21  in those days while morʹdecai was sitting in the kings gate bigʹthan and teʹresh two court officials of the king doorkeepers got angry and plotted to do away with king ahasueʹrus
22  but morʹdecai learned about it and he immediately told queen esther
esther then spoke to the king in morʹdecais name
23  so the matter was investigated and eventually confirmed and both men were hanged on a stake and this was all recorded in the book of the history of the times in the presence of the king
3  after this king ahasueʹrus promoted haʹman the son of hammedaʹtha the agʹagite and exalted him by putting his throne above all the other princes who were with him
2  and all the kings servants who were in the kings gate would bow low and prostrate themselves to haʹman for this is what the king had commanded respecting him
but morʹdecai refused to bow low or prostrate himself
3  so the kings servants who were in the kings gate said to morʹdecai why are you ignoring the kings commandment
4  day after day they would ask him but he would not listen to them
then they told haʹman to see whether morʹdecais conduct would be tolerated for he had told them that he was a jew
5  now when haʹman saw that morʹdecai refused to bow low and prostrate himself to him haʹman became filled with rage
6  but he despised the thought of doing away with morʹdecai alone for they had told him about morʹdecais people
so haʹman began seeking to annihilate all the jews who were in the entire realm of ahasueʹrus all of morʹdecais people
7  in the first month that is the month of niʹsan in the 12th year of king ahasueʹrus they cast pur that is the lot before haʹman to determine the day and the month and it fell on the 12th month that is aʹdar
8  haʹman then said to king ahasueʹrus there is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your realm whose laws are different from those of all other peoples and they do not obey the kings laws and it is not in the kings interests to let them be
9  if it pleases the king let a decree be written that they be destroyed
i will pay 10000 silver talents to the officials to put into the royal treasury
10  at that the king removed his signet ring from his own hand and gave it to haʹman the son of hammedaʹtha the agʹagite who was the enemy of the jews
11  the king said to haʹman the silver and the people are given to you to do with them as you see fit
12  the kings secretaries were then called on the 13th day of the first month
they put in writing all of haʹmans orders to the kings satraps the governors who were over the provinces and the princes of the different peoples to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language
it was written in the name of king ahasueʹrus and sealed with the kings signet ring
13  the letters were sent by means of couriers to all the kings provinces giving the order to annihilate to kill and to destroy all the jews young and old alike children and women on a single day on the 13th day of the 12th month that is the month of aʹdar and to seize their possessions
14  a copy of the document was to be issued as a law in every province and proclaimed to all the peoples so that they would be prepared for that day
15  the couriers went out quickly by order of the king the law was issued in shuʹshan the citadel
the king and haʹman then sat down to drink but the city of shuʹshan was in confusion
