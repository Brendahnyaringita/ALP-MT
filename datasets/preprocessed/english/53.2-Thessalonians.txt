1  paul silvaʹnus and timothy to the congregation of the thessaloʹnians in union with god our father and the lord jesus christ
2  may you have undeserved kindness and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ
3  we are obligated always to give thanks to god for you brothers
this is fitting because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another
4  as a result we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of god because of your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the hardships that you are suffering
5  this is a proof of the righteous judgment of god leading to your being counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which you are indeed suffering
6  this takes into account that it is righteous on gods part to repay tribulation to those who make tribulation for you
7  but you who suffer tribulation will be given relief along with us at the revelation of the lord jesus from heaven with his powerful angels
8  in a flaming fire as he brings vengeance on those who do not know god and those who do not obey the good news about our lord jesus
9  these very ones will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction from before the lord and from the glory of his strength
10  at the time when he comes to be glorified in connection with his holy ones and to be regarded in that day with wonder among all those who exercised faith because the witness we gave met with faith among you
11  to that very end we always pray for you that our god may count you worthy of his calling and with his power perform completely all the good that he pleases and every work of faith
12  this is so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in union with him according to the undeserved kindness of our god and of the lord jesus christ
2  however brothers concerning the presence of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered together to him we ask you
2  not to be quickly shaken from your reason nor to be alarmed either by an inspired statement or by a spoken message or by a letter appearing to be from us to the effect that the day of jehovah is here
3  let no one lead you astray in any way because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed the son of destruction
4  he stands in opposition and exalts himself above every socalled god or object of worship so that he sits down in the temple of god publicly showing himself to be a god
5  do you not remember that when i was still with you i used to tell you these things
6  and now you know what is acting as a restraint so that he will be revealed in his own due time
7  true the mystery of this lawlessness is already at work but only until the one who is right now acting as a restraint is out of the way
8  then indeed the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus will do away with by the spirit of his mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of his presence
9  but the lawless ones presence is by the operation of satan with every powerful work and lying signs and wonders
10  and every unrighteous deception for those who are perishing as a retribution because they did not accept the love of the truth in order that they might be saved
11  that is why god lets a deluding influence mislead them so that they may come to believe the lie
12  in order that they all may be judged because they did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness
13  however we are obligated always to thank god for you brothers loved by jehovah because from the beginning god selected you for salvation by sanctifying you with his spirit and by your faith in the truth
14  he called you to this through the good news we declare so that you may acquire the glory of our lord jesus christ
15  so then brothers stand firm and maintain your hold on the traditions that you were taught whether it was by a spoken message or by a letter from us
16  moreover may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who loved us and gave everlasting comfort and good hope by means of undeserved kindness
17  comfort your hearts and make you firm in every good deed and word
3  finally brothers carry on prayer for us that the word of jehovah may keep spreading rapidly and being glorified just as it is with you
2  and that we may be rescued from harmful and wicked men for faith is not a possession of all people
3  but the lord is faithful and he will strengthen you and protect you from the wicked one
4  moreover we have confidence in the lord regarding you that you are carrying out and will go on carrying out our instructions
5  may the lord continue to guide your hearts successfully to the love of god and to the endurance for the christ
6  now we are giving you instructions brothers in the name of our lord jesus christ to withdraw from every brother who is walking disorderly and not according to the tradition that you received from us
7  for you yourselves know how you should imitate us because we did not behave in a disorderly way among you
8  nor did we eat anyones food free
on the contrary by labor and toil we were working night and day so as not to impose an expensive burden on any one of you
9  not that we do not have authority but we wanted to offer ourselves as an example for you to imitate
10  in fact when we were with you we used to give you this order if anyone does not want to work neither let him eat
11  for we hear that some are walking disorderly among you not working at all but meddling with what does not concern them
12  to such people we give the order and exhortation in the lord jesus christ that they should work quietly and eat food they themselves earn
13  for your part brothers do not give up in doing good
14  but if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter keep this one marked and stop associating with him so that he may become ashamed
15  and yet do not consider him an enemy but continue admonishing him as a brother
16  now may the lord of peace himself give you peace constantly in every way
may the lord be with all of you
17  here is my greeting pauls in my own hand which is a sign in every letter this is the way i write
18  the undeserved kindness of our lord jesus christ be with all of you
