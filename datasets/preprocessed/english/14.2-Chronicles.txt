10  rehoboʹam went to sheʹchem for all israel had come to sheʹchem to make him king
2  as soon as jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat heard of it he was still in egypt because he had fled on account of king solʹomon jeroboʹam came back from egypt
3  then they sent for him and jeroboʹam and all israel came to rehoboʹam and said
4  your father made our yoke harsh
but if you make the harsh service of your father easier and you lighten the heavy yoke he put on us we will serve you
5  at this he said to them return to me after three days
so the people went away
6  king rehoboʹam then consulted with the older men who had served his father solʹomon while he was alive saying what advice would you give on how to reply to this people
7  they answered him if you are good to this people and please them and give them a favorable answer they will always be your servants
8  however he rejected the advice that the older men gave him and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his attendants
9  he asked them what advice do you offer on how we should reply to this people who have said to me make the yoke your father put on us lighter
10  the young men who had grown up with him said to him this is what you should say to the people who have said to you your father made our yoke heavy but you should make it lighter for us this is what you should tell them my little finger will be thicker than my fathers hips
11  my father imposed a heavy yoke on you but i will add to your yoke
my father punished you with whips but i will do so with scourges
12  jeroboʹam and all the people came to rehoboʹam on the third day just as the king had said return to me on the third day
13  but the king answered them harshly
thus king rehoboʹam rejected the advice of the older men
14  he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men saying i will make your yoke heavier and i will add to it
my father punished you with whips but i will do so with scourges
15  so the king did not listen to the people for this turn of events was caused by the true god in order to carry out the word that jehovah had spoken through ahiʹjah the shiʹlonite to jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat
16  as for all israel because the king refused to listen to them the people replied to the king what share do we have in david we have no inheritance in the son of jesʹse
each one to your gods o israel now look after your own house o david
with that all israel returned to their homes
17  but rehoboʹam continued to reign over the israelites living in the cities of judah
18  then king rehoboʹam sent hadoʹram who was in charge of those conscripted for forced labor but the israelites stoned him to death
king rehoboʹam managed to mount his chariot to flee to jerusalem
19  and the israelites have been in revolt against the house of david down to this day
4  then he made the copper altar 20 cubits long 20 cubits wide and 10 cubits high
2  he made the sea of cast metal
it was circular in shape 10 cubits from brim to brim and 5 cubits high and it took a measuring line 30 cubits long to encircle it
3  and there were ornamental gourds under it completely encircling it ten to a cubit all around the sea
the gourds were in two rows and were cast in one piece with it
4  it stood on 12 bulls 3 facing north 3 facing west 3 facing south and 3 facing east and the sea rested on them and all their hindquarters were toward the center
5  and its thickness was a handbreadth and its brim was made like the brim of a cup like a lily blossom
the reservoir could hold 3000 bath measures
6  further he made ten basins for washing and put five to the right and five to the left
they would rinse in them the things used for the burnt offering
but the sea was for the priests for washing
7  he then made ten lampstands of gold as specified and put them in the temple five on the right and five on the left
8  he also made ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right and five on the left and he made 100 golden bowls
9  then he made the courtyard of the priests and the great court and the doors for the court and he overlaid their doors with copper
10  and he placed the sea on the right side toward the southeast
11  hiʹram also made the cans the shovels and the bowls
so hiʹram finished the work that he did for king solʹomon on the house of the true god
12  the two pillars and the bowlshaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars the two networks to cover the two bowlshaped capitals that were on top of the pillars
13  the 400 pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowlshaped capitals that were on the pillars
14  the ten carriages and the ten basins on the carriages
15  the sea and the 12 bulls beneath it
16  and the cans the shovels the forks and all their utensils hiʹramaʹbiv made of polished copper for king solʹomon for the house of jehovah
17  the king cast them in the district of the jordan in the thick clay between sucʹcoth and zerʹedah
18  solʹomon made all these utensils in great quantities the weight of the copper was not ascertained
19  solʹomon made all the utensils for the house of the true god the altar of gold the tables with the showbread on them
20  the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the innermost room according to the requirements
21  and the blossoms the lamps and the snuffers of gold the purest gold
22  the extinguishers the bowls the cups and the fire holders of pure gold and the entrance of the house its inner doors for the most holy and the doors of the house of the temple of gold
26  then all the people of judah took uzziʹah who was 16 years old and made him king in place of his father amaziʹah
2  he rebuilt eʹloth and restored it to judah after the king was laid to rest with his forefathers
3  uzziʹah was 16 years old when he became king and he reigned for 52 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was jecoliʹah of jerusalem
4  he continued to do what was right in jehovahs eyes just as his father amaziʹah had done
5  and he kept searching for god in the days of zechariʹah who taught him to fear the true god
during the time he was searching for jehovah the true god made him prosper
6  he went out and fought against the philisʹtines and broke through the wall of gath the wall of jabʹneh and the wall of ashʹdod
then he built cities in the territory of ashʹdod and among the philisʹtines
7  the true god continued to help him against the philisʹtines against the arabians who were dwelling in gurbaʹal and against the meuʹnim
8  the amʹmonites began to give tribute to uzziʹah
his fame eventually spread as far as egypt for he became extremely powerful
9  moreover uzziʹah built towers in jerusalem by the corner gate the valley gate and the buttress and he fortified them
10  further he built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns for he had a great deal of livestock he also did so in the shepheʹlah and on the plain
he had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in carʹmel for he loved agriculture
11  moreover uzziʹah came to have an army equipped for war
they would go out on military campaigns organized in divisions
they were numbered and registered by jeiʹel the secretary and maaseiʹah the officer under the command of hananiʹah one of the kings princes
12  the entire number of the heads of the paternal houses who were over these mighty warriors was 2600
13  the armed forces under their command numbered 307500 men ready for war a powerful military force to support the king against the enemy
14  uzziʹah equipped the entire army with shields lances helmets coats of mail bows and slingstones
15  further in jerusalem he made engines of war designed by engineers they were set on the towers and on the corners of the walls and could shoot arrows and large stones
so his fame spread far and wide for he received tremendous help and he became strong
16  however as soon as he was strong his heart became haughty to his own ruin and he acted unfaithfully against jehovah his god by entering the temple of jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense
17  immediately azariʹah the priest and 80 other courageous priests of jehovah went in after him
18  they confronted king uzziʹah and said to him it is not proper for you uzziʹah to burn incense to jehovah it is only the priests who should burn incense for they are the descendants of aaron those who have been sanctified
go out from the sanctuary for you have acted unfaithfully and you will receive no glory from jehovah god for this
19  but uzziʹah who had a censer in his hand to burn incense became enraged and during his rage against the priests leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of jehovah next to the altar of incense
20  when azariʹah the chief priest and all the priests turned toward him they saw that he had been stricken with leprosy in his forehead so they rushed him out of there and he himself hurried out because jehovah had struck him
21  king uzziʹah remained a leper until the day of his death and he kept staying in a separate house as a leper for he had been excluded from the house of jehovah
his son joʹtham was in charge of the kings house judging the people of the land
22  and the rest of the history of uzziʹah from beginning to end was recorded by the prophet isaiah the son of aʹmoz
23  then uzziʹah was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him with his forefathers but in the burial field that belonged to the kings for they said he is a leper
and his son joʹtham became king in his place
11  when rehoboʹam arrived in jerusalem he immediately congregated the house of judah and benjamin 180000 trained warriors to fight against israel in order to restore the kingdom to rehoboʹam
2  then the word of jehovah came to shemaiʹah the man of the true god saying
3  say to rehoboʹam the son of solʹomon the king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin
4  this is what jehovah says you must not go up and fight against your brothers
each of you return to his house for i have caused this to happen
so they obeyed the word of jehovah and returned and did not go against jeroboʹam
5  rehoboʹam lived in jerusalem and built fortified cities in judah
6  thus he built up bethʹlehem eʹtam tekoʹa
7  bethzur soʹco adulʹlam
8  gath mareʹshah ziph
9  adoraʹim laʹchish azeʹkah
10  zoʹrah aiʹjalon and hebʹron fortified cities that were in judah and benjamin
11  further he reinforced the fortified places and put commanders in them and supplied them with food and oil and wine
12  and he supplied all the different cities with large shields and lances he reinforced them to a very great degree
and judah and benjamin remained his
13  and the priests and the levites who were in all israel took their stand with him coming out of all their territories
14  the levites left their pastures and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem because jeroboʹam and his sons had dismissed them from serving as priests to jehovah
15  jeroboʹam then appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goatlike demons and for the calves that he had made
16  and those from all the tribes of israel who had their heart set on seeking jehovah the god of israel followed them to jerusalem to sacrifice to jehovah the god of their forefathers
17  for three years they strengthened the kingship of judah and supported rehoboʹam the son of solʹomon for they walked in the way of david and solʹomon for three years
18  then rehoboʹam took as his wife maʹhalath the daughter of davids son jerʹimoth and of abʹihail the daughter of jesʹses son eliʹab
19  in time she bore him sons jeʹush shemariʹah and zaʹham
20  after her he married maʹacah the granddaughter of abʹsalom
in time she bore him abiʹjah atʹtai ziʹza and sheloʹmith
21  rehoboʹam loved maʹacah the granddaughter of abʹsalom more than all his other wives and concubines for he took 18 wives and 60 concubines and he became father to 28 sons and 60 daughters
22  so rehoboʹam appointed abiʹjah the son of maʹacah as head and leader among his brothers for he intended to make him king
23  however he acted with understanding and sent some of his sons to all the regions of judah and benjamin to all the fortified cities and gave them abundant provisions and acquired many wives for them
8  at the end of 20 years during which solʹomon built the house of jehovah and his own house
2  solʹomon rebuilt the cities that hiʹram had given solʹomon and settled israelites there
3  furthermore solʹomon went to haʹmathzoʹbah and captured it
4  then he built up tadʹmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities that he had built in haʹmath
5  he also built up upper bethhoʹron and lower bethhoʹron fortified cities with walls gates and bars
6  and baʹalath as well as all of solʹomons storage cities all the chariot cities the cities for the horsemen and whatever solʹomon desired to build in jerusalem in lebʹanon and in all the land of his dominion
7  as for all the people who were left from the hitʹtites the amʹorites the perʹizzites the hiʹvites and the jebʹusites who were not part of israel
8  their descendants who were left in the landthose whom the israelites had not exterminatedwere conscripted by solʹomon for forced labor until this day
9  but solʹomon did not make any of the israelites slaves for his work for they were his warriors the chiefs of his adjutants and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen
10  there were 250 chiefs of the deputies of king solʹomon the foremen over the people
11  solʹomon also brought pharʹaohs daughter up from the city of david to the house that he had built for her for he said although she is my wife she should not dwell in the house of king david of israel for the places to which the ark of jehovah has come are holy
12  then solʹomon offered up burnt sacrifices to jehovah on the altar of jehovah that he had built in front of the porch
13  he followed the daily routine and made offerings according to the commandment of moses for the sabbaths the new moons and the appointed festivals three times in the yearthe festival of unleavened bread the festival of weeks and the festival of booths
14  further he appointed the divisions of the priests for their services according to the rule of his father david and the levites for their posts of duty to praise and to minister in the presence of the priests according to the daily routine and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the different gates for such was the commandment of david the man of the true god
15  and they did not deviate from the kings commandment to the priests and the levites concerning any matter or concerning the storehouses
16  so solʹomons work was all wellorganized from the day the foundation of the house of jehovah was laid until it was finished
so the house of jehovah was completed
17  it was then that solʹomon went to eʹziongeʹber and to eʹloth on the seashore in the land of eʹdom
18  hiʹram sent him ships and experienced seamen by means of his own servants
they went with solʹomons servants to oʹphir and took from there 450 talents of gold and brought it to king solʹomon
30  hezekiʹah sent word to all israel and judah and even wrote letters to eʹphraim and manasʹseh to come to the house of jehovah in jerusalem to observe the passover to jehovah the god of israel
2  however the king his princes and the whole congregation in jerusalem decided to observe the passover in the second month
3  for they had not been able to observe it at the regular time because not enough priests had sanctified themselves nor had the people gathered in jerusalem
4  this arrangement seemed right in the eyes of the king and the entire congregation
5  so they decided to make an announcement throughout israel from beʹersheʹba to dan that the people should come and observe the passover to jehovah the god of israel at jerusalem for as a group they had not observed it according to what is written
6  then the couriers went throughout all israel and judah with the letters from the king and his princes as the king had commanded saying people of israel return to jehovah the god of abraham isaac and israel so that he may return to the remnant who escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyrʹia
7  do not be like your forefathers and your brothers who acted unfaithfully toward jehovah the god of their forefathers so that he made them an object of horror just as you are seeing
8  now do not be obstinate like your forefathers
submit to jehovah and come to his sanctuary that he has sanctified forever and serve jehovah your god so that his burning anger may turn away from you
9  for when you return to jehovah your brothers and your sons will be shown mercy by their captors and will be allowed to return to this land for jehovah your god is compassionate and merciful and he will not turn his face away from you if you return to him
10  so the couriers went from city to city throughout the land of eʹphraim and manasʹseh even to zebʹulun but the people were making fun of them and mocking them
11  however some individuals from ashʹer manasʹseh and zebʹulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem
12  the hand of the true god was also in judah to unite them to carry out what the king and the princes had commanded by the word of jehovah
13  a multitude of people gathered together at jerusalem to observe the festival of unleavened bread in the second month it was a very large congregation
14  they rose up and removed the altars that were in jerusalem and they removed all the incense altars and threw them into the kidʹron valley
15  then they slaughtered the passover sacrifice on the 14th day of the second month
the priests and the levites felt ashamed so they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of jehovah
16  they took their customary places according to the law of moses the man of the true god then the priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the levites
17  there were many in the congregation who had not sanctified themselves and the levites were in charge of slaughtering the passover sacrifices for all who were not clean to sanctify them to jehovah
18  for a great number of the people especially those from eʹphraim manasʹseh isʹsachar and zebʹulun had not cleansed themselves but they still ate the passover contrary to what is written
but hezekiʹah prayed for them saying may jehovah who is good make allowance for
19  everyone who has prepared his heart to search for the true god jehovah the god of his forefathers although he has not been purified according to the standard of holiness
20  and jehovah listened to hezekiʹah and pardoned the people
21  so the israelites who were in jerusalem observed the festival of unleavened bread for seven days with great rejoicing and the levites and the priests were praising jehovah day by day loudly playing their instruments to jehovah
22  moreover hezekiʹah spoke to and encouraged all the levites who served jehovah with discretion
and they ate throughout the festival for seven days sacrificing communion sacrifices and giving thanks to jehovah the god of their forefathers
23  then all the congregation decided to observe it for seven more days so they observed it for seven more days with rejoicing
24  and king hezekiʹah of judah contributed for the congregation 1000 bulls and 7000 sheep and the princes contributed for the congregation 1000 bulls and 10000 sheep and priests were sanctifying themselves in great number
25  and all the congregation of judah the priests the levites all the congregation that came from israel and the foreign residents who came from the land of israel and those living in judah continued rejoicing
26  and there was great rejoicing in jerusalem for from the days of solʹomon the son of david the king of israel nothing like this had happened in jerusalem
27  finally the levite priests stood up and blessed the people and god heard their voice and their prayer reached his holy dwelling the heavens
16  in the 36th year of the reign of aʹsa king baʹasha of israel came up against judah and began to build up raʹmah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to king aʹsa of judah
2  at that aʹsa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of jehovahs house and the kings house and sent them to king benhaʹdad of syria who was dwelling in damascus saying
3  there is a treaty between me and you and between my father and your father
i am sending you silver and gold
come break your treaty with king baʹasha of israel so that he will withdraw from me
4  benhaʹdad listened to king aʹsa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of israel and they struck down iʹjon dan aʹbelmaʹim and all the storage places of the cities of naphʹtali
5  when baʹasha heard of it he immediately quit building raʹmah and abandoned his work on it
6  king aʹsa then took all judah and they carried off the stones and timbers of raʹmah that baʹasha had been building with and with them he built up geʹba and mizʹpah
7  at that time hanaʹni the seer came to king aʹsa of judah and said to him because you relied on the king of syria and did not rely on jehovah your god the army of the king of syria has escaped out of your hand
8  were not the ethioʹpians and the libʹyans a very great army with many chariots and horsemen but because you relied on jehovah he gave them into your hand
9  for the eyes of jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him
you have acted foolishly in this matter from now on there will be wars against you
10  however aʹsa became offended at the seer and put him in prison because he was enraged at him over this
and aʹsa began to mistreat others among the people at that same time
11  now the history of aʹsa from beginning to end is written in the book of the kings of judah and of israel
12  in the 39th year of his reign aʹsa developed an ailment in his feet until he became very sick and even in his sickness he turned not to jehovah but to the healers
13  then aʹsa was laid to rest with his forefathers he died in the 41st year of his reign
14  so they buried him in the grand burial place that he had excavated for himself in the city of david and they laid him on a bier that had been filled with balsam oil and different sorts of ingredients mixed into a specially made ointment
further they made an extraordinarily great funeral burning for him
35  josiʹah held a passover to jehovah in jerusalem and they slaughtered the passover sacrifice on the 14th day of the first month
2  he assigned the priests to their duties and encouraged them to carry out their service of the house of jehovah
3  then he said to the levites the instructors of all israel those who were holy to jehovah put the holy ark in the house that solʹomon the son of david the king of israel built you are no longer to carry it on your shoulders
now serve jehovah your god and his people israel
4  and prepare yourselves by your paternal houses according to your divisions following what was written by king david of israel and by his son solʹomon
5  stand in the holy place grouped by the paternal houses of your brothers the rest of the people with a corresponding group of the paternal house of the levites
6  slaughter the passover sacrifice and sanctify yourselves and make preparation for your brothers to carry out the word of jehovah through moses
7  josiʹah contributed flocks to the people male lambs and young male goats for the passover sacrifices for all who were present a total of 30000 as well as 3000 cattle
these were from the kings own property
8  his princes also made a contribution as a voluntary offering for the people the priests and the levites
hilkiʹah zechariʹah and jehiʹel the leaders of the house of the true god gave to the priests 2600 passover sacrifices and 300 cattle
9  conaniʹah and his brothers shemaiʹah and nethanʹel along with hashabiʹah jeiʹel and joʹzabad the chiefs of the levites contributed to the levites 5000 passover sacrifices and 500 cattle
10  the service was prepared and the priests stood at their places and the levites by their divisions as the king had commanded
11  they slaughtered the passover sacrifices and the priests sprinkled the blood they received from them while the levites were skinning the animals
12  next they prepared the burnt offerings so as to distribute them to the rest of the people who were grouped by paternal house so that they could be presented to jehovah as it is written in the book of moses and they did the same with the cattle
13  they cooked the passover offering over the fire according to the custom and they cooked the holy offerings in pots cauldrons and pans after which they brought it quickly to all the rest of the people
14  then they made preparations for themselves and for the priests because the priests the descendants of aaron were offering up the burnt sacrifices and the fat pieces until nightfall so the levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests the descendants of aaron
15  and the singers the sons of aʹsaph were at their positions by the commandment of david aʹsaph heʹman and jeduʹthun the visionary of the king and the gatekeepers were at the different gates
there was no need for them to leave their service because their brothers the levites made preparations for them
16  so all the service of jehovah was prepared on that day to hold the passover and to offer up the burnt offerings on the altar of jehovah according to the order of king josiʹah
17  the israelites who were present held the passover at that time and the festival of unleavened bread for seven days
18  there had never been held a passover like it in israel since the days of samuel the prophet nor had any of the other kings of israel held a passover like that held by josiʹah the priests the levites all judah and israel who were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem
19  this passover was held in the 18th year of josiʹahs reign
20  after all of this when josiʹah had prepared the temple king neʹcho of egypt came up to fight at carʹchemish by the euphraʹtes
then josiʹah went out against him
21  so he sent messengers to him saying what does this have to do with you o king of judah i am not coming against you today but my fight is against another house and god says that i should hurry
for your own sake refrain from opposing god who is with me or he will bring you to ruin
22  however josiʹah would not turn away from him but he disguised himself to fight against him and would not listen to the words of neʹcho which were from the mouth of god
so he came to fight in the plain of megidʹdo
23  and the archers shot king josiʹah and the king said to his servants get me out of here for i am severely wounded
24  so his servants took him out of the chariot and had him ride in his second war chariot and brought him to jerusalem
thus he died and was buried in the tomb of his forefathers and all judah and jerusalem mourned josiʹah
25  and jeremiah chanted over josiʹah and all the male and female singers keep singing about josiʹah in their dirges down to this day and a decision was made that they should be sung in israel and they are written among the dirges
26  as for the rest of the history of josiʹah and his deeds of loyal love in keeping with what is written in the law of jehovah
27  and what he did from beginning to end they are written in the book of the kings of israel and of judah
18  jehoshʹaphat had riches and glory in abundance but he made a marriage alliance with aʹhab
2  so years later he went down to aʹhab at samarʹia and aʹhab sacrificed sheep and cattle in abundance for him and for the people with him
and he urged him to go up against raʹmothgilʹead
3  then king aʹhab of israel said to king jehoshʹaphat of judah will you go with me to raʹmothgilʹead he replied to him i am the same as you and my people are the same as your people and will support you in the war
4  but jehoshʹaphat said to the king of israel first inquire please for the word of jehovah
5  so the king of israel gathered the prophets together 400 men and said to them should we go to war against raʹmothgilʹead or should i refrain they said go up and the true god will give it into the kings hand
6  jehoshʹaphat then said is there not here a prophet of jehovah let us also inquire through him
7  at that the king of israel said to jehoshʹaphat there is still one more man through whom we can inquire of jehovah but i hate him for he never prophesies good things concerning me but always bad
he is micaiʹah the son of imʹlah
however jehoshʹaphat said the king should not say such a thing
8  so the king of israel called a court official and said bring micaiʹah the son of imʹlah quickly
9  now the king of israel and jehoshʹaphat the king of judah were each sitting on his throne dressed in royal attire they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of samarʹia and all the prophets were prophesying before them
10  then zedekiʹah the son of chenaʹanah made for himself iron horns and said this is what jehovah says with these you will gore the syrians until you exterminate them
11  all the other prophets were prophesying the same way saying go up to raʹmothgilʹead and you will be successful jehovah will give it into the kings hand
12  so the messenger who went to call micaiʹah said to him look the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king
let your word please become like theirs and speak favorably
13  but micaiʹah said as surely as jehovah is living whatever my god says is what i will speak
14  then he came in to the king and the king asked him micaiʹah should we go to war against raʹmothgilʹead or should i refrain at once he replied go up and you will be successful they will be given into your hand
15  at that the king said to him how many times must i put you under oath not to speak to me anything but the truth in the name of jehovah
16  so he said i see all the israelites scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd
jehovah said these have no master
let each one go back to his house in peace
17  then the king of israel said to jehoshʹaphat did i not tell you he will not prophesy good things concerning me only bad
18  micaiʹah then said therefore hear the word of jehovah i saw jehovah sitting on his throne and all the army of the heavens standing at his right and at his left
19  jehovah then said who will fool king aʹhab of israel so that he will go up and fall at raʹmothgilʹead and one was saying one thing while another said something else
20  then a spirit came forward and stood before jehovah and said i will fool him
jehovah asked him how will you do it
21  he replied i will go out and become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets
so he said you will fool him and what is more you will be successful
go out and do that
22  and now jehovah has put a deceptive spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours but jehovah has declared calamity for you
23  zedekiʹah the son of chenaʹanah now approached and struck micaiʹah on the cheek and said which way did the spirit of jehovah pass from me to speak with you
24  micaiʹah replied look you will see which way on the day when you will enter the innermost room to hide
25  then the king of israel said take micaiʹah and turn him over to aʹmon the chief of the city and to joʹash the kings son
26  tell them this is what the king says put this fellow in the prison and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and water until i return in peace
27  but micaiʹah said if you do return in peace jehovah has not spoken with me
then he added take note all you peoples
28  so the king of israel and jehoshʹaphat the king of judah went up to raʹmothgilʹead
29  the king of israel now said to jehoshʹaphat i will disguise myself and will go into the battle but you should put on your royal attire
so the king of israel disguised himself and they entered the battle
30  now the king of syria had ordered his chariot commanders do not fight with anyone small or great except the king of israel
31  and as soon as the chariot commanders saw jehoshʹaphat they said to themselves it is the king of israel
so they turned to fight against him and jehoshʹaphat began to cry for help and jehovah helped him and god at once diverted them from him
32  when the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of israel they immediately turned back from following him
33  but one man shot his bow at random and he struck the king of israel between the joints of his coat of mail
so the king said to his charioteer turn around and take me out of the battle for i have been badly wounded
34  the fighting raged throughout that day and the king of israel had to be propped up in the chariot facing the syrians until the evening and he died at sunset
17  and his son jehoshʹaphat became king in his place and he strengthened his position over israel
2  he stationed military forces in all the fortified cities of judah and put garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of eʹphraim that aʹsa his father had captured
3  jehovah continued with jehoshʹaphat because he walked in the former ways of his forefather david and did not search for the baʹals
4  for he searched for the god of his father and followed his commandment and not the practices of israel
5  jehovah kept the kingdom firmly established in his hand and all judah continued to give gifts to jehoshʹaphat and he had riches and glory in abundance
6  his heart became bold in the ways of jehovah and he even removed the high places and the sacred poles from judah
7  in the third year of his reign he sent for his princes benhaʹil obadiʹah zechariʹah nethanʹel and micaiʹah to teach in the cities of judah
8  there were levites with them shemaiʹah nethaniʹah zebadiʹah asʹahel shemirʹamoth jehonʹathan adoniʹjah tobiʹjah and tobadoniʹjah and along with them elishʹama and jehoʹram the priests
9  they began teaching in judah taking with them the book of jehovahs law and they went around through all the cities of judah teaching among the people
10  and the dread of jehovah came upon all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding judah and they did not fight against jehoshʹaphat
11  and the philisʹtines brought to jehoshʹaphat gifts and money as tribute
the arabs brought him 7700 rams and 7700 male goats from their flocks
12  jehoshʹaphat grew greater and greater and he continued building fortified places and storage cities in judah
13  he carried out extensive projects in the cities of judah and he had soldiers mighty warriors in jerusalem
14  these were grouped by their paternal houses of judah the chiefs of thousands adʹnah the chief and with him were 300000 mighty warriors
15  and under his command was jehohaʹnan the chief and with him were 280000
16  and also under his command was amasiʹah the son of zichʹri who volunteered for jehovahs service and with him were 200000 mighty warriors
17  and out of benjamin was eliʹada a mighty warrior and with him were 200000 men equipped with the bow and shield
18  and under his command was jehozʹabad and with him were 180000 men equipped for the army
19  these were ministering to the king in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all judah
9  now the queen of sheʹba heard the report about solʹomon so she came to jerusalem to test solʹomon with perplexing questions
she was accompanied by a very impressive entourage with camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones
she went in to solʹomon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart
2  solʹomon then answered all her questions
there was nothing too difficult for solʹomon to explain to her
3  when the queen of sheʹba had seen solʹomons wisdom the house that he built
4  the food of his table the seating of his servants the table service of his waiters and their attire his cupbearers and their attire and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of jehovah she was left completely breathless
5  so she said to the king the report that i heard in my own land about your achievements and about your wisdom was true
6  but i did not put faith in the reports until i had come and had seen it with my own eyes
and look i had not been told the half of your great wisdom
you have far surpassed the report that i heard
7  happy are your men and happy are your servants who stand before you constantly listening to your wisdom
8  may jehovah your god be praised who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on his throne as king for jehovah your god
because your god loves israel in order to make it continue forever he appointed you over it as king to administer justice and righteousness
9  then she gave the king 120 talents of gold and a great quantity of balsam oil and precious stones
never again was such balsam oil brought in as what the queen of sheʹba gave to king solʹomon
10  moreover the servants of hiʹram and the servants of solʹomon who brought gold from oʹphir also brought algum timbers and precious stones
11  the king made from the algum timbers stairs for the house of jehovah and for the kings house as well as harps and stringed instruments for the singers
nothing like them had ever been seen before in the land of judah
12  king solʹomon also gave the queen of sheʹba whatever she desired and asked for more than what she had brought to the king
then she left and returned to her own land together with her servants
13  and the weight of the gold that came to solʹomon in one year amounted to 666 talents of gold
14  besides that brought in by the merchants and the traders and all the kings of the arabs and the governors of the land who were bringing gold and silver in to solʹomon
15  king solʹomon made 200 large shields of alloyed gold 600 shekels of alloyed gold went on each shield
16  and 300 bucklers of alloyed gold three miʹnas of gold went on each buckler
then the king put them in the house of the forest of lebʹanon
17  the king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold
18  there were six steps to the throne and there was a gold footstool attached to the throne and there were armrests on both sides of the seat and two lions were standing beside the armrests
19  and there were 12 lions standing on the six steps one at each end of the six steps
no other kingdom had made anything like it
20  all the drinking vessels of king solʹomon were of gold and all the utensils of the house of the forest of lebʹanon were of pure gold
there was nothing made of silver for silver was considered as nothing in the days of solʹomon
21  for the kings ships would go to tarʹshish with the servants of hiʹram
once every three years the ships of tarʹshish would come loaded with gold and silver ivory apes and peacocks
22  so king solʹomon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom
23  and the kings of all the earth sought an audience with solʹomon to hear his wisdom that the true god had put in his heart
24  they would each bring a giftarticles of silver articles of gold garments armor balsam oil horses and mulesand this continued year after year
25  and solʹomon had 4000 stalls for his horses and chariots and 12000 horses and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in jerusalem
26  and he ruled over all the kings from the river to the land of the philisʹtines and to the boundary of egypt
27  the king made the silver in jerusalem as plentiful as the stones and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the shepheʹlah
28  and they would bring horses to solʹomon from egypt and from all the other lands
29  as for the rest of the history of solʹomon from beginning to end is it not written among the words of nathan the prophet in the prophecy of ahiʹjah the shiʹlonite and in the record of visions of idʹdo the visionary concerning jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat
30  solʹomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel for 40 years
31  then solʹomon was laid to rest with his forefathers
so they buried him in the city of david his father and his son rehoboʹam became king in his place
28  aʹhaz was 20 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in jerusalem
he did not do what was right in jehovahs eyes as david his forefather had done
2  instead he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and he even made metal statues of the baʹals
3  moreover he made sacrificial smoke in the valley of the son of hinʹnom and burned up his sons in the fire following the detestable practices of the nations that jehovah had driven out from before the israelites
4  he also kept sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places on the hills and under every luxuriant tree
5  so jehovah his god gave him into the hand of the king of syria so that they defeated him and carried off a great number of captives and brought them to damascus
he was also given into the hand of the king of israel who inflicted on him a great slaughter
6  for peʹkah the son of remaliʹah killed in judah 120000 in one day all brave men because they had abandoned jehovah the god of their forefathers
7  and zichʹri an eʹphraimite warrior killed the kings son maaseiʹah and azriʹkam who was in charge of the palace and elkaʹnah who was second to the king
8  moreover the israelites took 200000 of their brothers captivewomen sons and daughters they also seized a great deal of spoil and they took the spoil to samarʹia
9  but a prophet of jehovah named oʹded was there
he went out before the army that was coming to samarʹia and said to them look it was because jehovah the god of your forefathers was angry with judah that he gave them into your hand and you slaughtered them with a fury that has reached clear to the heavens
10  and now you intend to make the people of judah and jerusalem your male and female servants
nevertheless are you not also guilty before jehovah your god
11  now listen to me and return the captives whom you took from your brothers for jehovahs burning anger is against you
12  at that some of the chiefs of the eʹphraimites azariʹah the son of jehohaʹnan berechiʹah the son of meshilʹlemoth jehizkiʹah the son of shalʹlum and amaʹsa the son of hadʹlai confronted those coming in from the military campaign
13  and they said to them do not bring the captives in here for it will make us guilty before jehovah
what you intend to do will add to our sins and to our guilt for our guilt is already great and there is burning anger against israel
14  so the armed soldiers handed over the captives and the plunder to the princes and the entire congregation
15  then the men who had been designated by name rose up and took hold of the captives and they provided clothes from the spoil for all those among them who were naked
so they clothed them and gave them sandals food and drink and oil for their skin
furthermore they transported the feeble on donkeys and brought them to their brothers in jerʹicho the city of palm trees
after that they returned to samarʹia
16  at that time king aʹhaz asked the kings of assyrʹia for help
17  and once again the eʹdomites invaded and attacked judah and carried off captives
18  the philisʹtines also made a raid on the cities of the shepheʹlah and the negʹeb of judah and captured bethsheʹmesh aiʹjalon gedeʹroth soʹco and its dependent towns timʹnah and its dependent towns and gimʹzo and its dependent towns and they settled there
19  jehovah humbled judah because of king aʹhaz of israel for he had let judah go unrestrained resulting in great unfaithfulness toward jehovah
20  king tilʹgathpilneʹser of assyrʹia eventually came against him and caused him distress rather than strengthening him
21  for aʹhaz had stripped the house of jehovah and the house of the king and the houses of the princes and made a gift to the king of assyrʹia but it was of no help to him
22  and during his time of distress king aʹhaz acted even more unfaithfully toward jehovah
23  he began to sacrifice to the gods of damascus that had defeated him and he went on to say because the gods of the kings of syria are helping them i will sacrifice to them so that they may help me
but they caused him and all israel to stumble
24  furthermore aʹhaz collected the utensils of the house of the true god he then cut to pieces the utensils of the house of the true god closed the doors of the house of jehovah and made altars for himself in every corner of jerusalem
25  and in all the cities of judah he made high places for making sacrificial smoke to other gods and he offended jehovah the god of his forefathers
26  as for the rest of his history all his dealings from beginning to end there it is written in the book of the kings of judah and of israel
27  then aʹhaz was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the city in jerusalem for they did not bring him into the burial places of the kings of israel
and his son hezekiʹah became king in his place
27  joʹtham was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was jeruʹshah the daughter of zaʹdok
2  he kept doing what was right in jehovahs eyes just as his father uzziʹah had done except that he did not invade the temple of jehovah
but the people were still acting ruinously
3  he built the upper gate of jehovahs house and he did much building on the wall of oʹphel
4  he also built cities in the mountainous region of judah and he built fortified places and towers in the wooded areas
5  he waged war against the king of the amʹmonites and eventually prevailed against them so that the amʹmonites gave him in that year 100 silver talents 10000 cor measures of wheat and 10000 of barley
the amʹmonites also paid this to him in the second and third years
6  so joʹtham kept growing strong for he established his ways before jehovah his god
7  as for the rest of the history of joʹtham all his wars and his ways it is written in the book of the kings of israel and of judah
8  he was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in jerusalem
9  then joʹtham was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the city of david
and his son aʹhaz became king in his place
7  now as soon as solʹomon had finished praying fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and jehovahs glory filled the house
2  the priests were unable to enter the house of jehovah because jehovahs glory had filled the house of jehovah
3  and all the people of israel were looking on when the fire came down and the glory of jehovah was upon the house and they bowed low with their faces to the ground on the pavement and prostrated themselves and thanked jehovah for he is good his loyal love endures forever
4  now the king and all the people offered sacrifices before jehovah
5  king solʹomon offered the sacrifice of 22000 cattle and 120000 sheep
thus the king and all the people inaugurated the house of the true god
6  the priests were standing at their posts of duty as were the levites who had the instruments used to accompany the song to jehovah
king david had made these instruments for giving thanks to jehovahfor his loyal love endures foreverwhen david would offer praise with them
and the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets in front of them while all the israelites were standing
7  then solʹomon sanctified the middle of the courtyard that was before the house of jehovah for there he had to offer up the burnt offerings and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices because the copper altar that solʹomon had made could not contain the burnt sacrifices the grain offerings and the fat pieces
8  at that time solʹomon held the festival for seven days together with all israel a very great congregation from leʹbohaʹmath down to the wadi of egypt
9  but on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly because they had held the inauguration of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days
10  then on the 23rd day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes rejoicing and feeling glad of heart over the goodness that jehovah had shown to david and solʹomon and israel his people
11  thus solʹomon finished the house of jehovah and the house of the king and everything that came into solʹomons heart to do regarding the house of jehovah and his own house he accomplished successfully
12  jehovah then appeared to solʹomon during the night and said to him i have heard your prayer and i have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice
13  when i shut up the heavens and there is no rain and when i command the grasshoppers to devour the land and if i send a pestilence among my people
14  if my people on whom my name has been called humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn away from their evil ways then i will hear from the heavens and forgive their sin and heal their land
15  now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to prayer at this place
16  and now i have chosen and sanctified this house so that my name may be there permanently and my eyes and my heart will always be there
17  and you if you walk before me as your father david walked by doing everything i have commanded you and you obey my regulations and my judgments
18  then i will establish the throne of your kingship just as i made a covenant with your father david saying there will never fail to be a man of your line ruling over israel
19  but if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments that i have put before you and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them
20  i will uproot israel from my land that i have given them and this house that i have sanctified for my name i will cast out of my sight and i will make it an object of scorn and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples
21  and this house will become heaps of ruins
everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will say why did jehovah do that to this land and this house
22  then they will say it was because they abandoned jehovah the god of their forefathers who had brought them out of the land of egypt and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them
that is why he brought all this calamity on them
34  josiʹah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned for 31 years in jerusalem
2  he did what was right in jehovahs eyes and walked in the ways of david his forefather and he did not deviate to the right or to the left
3  in the 8th year of his reign while he was still a boy he started to search for the god of david his forefather and in the 12th year he started to cleanse judah and jerusalem of the high places and the sacred poles the graven images and the metal statues
4  further they tore down the altars of the baʹals in his presence and he cut down the incense stands that were up above them
he also broke into pieces the sacred poles the graven images and the metal statues and reduced them to powder and sprinkled it over the graves of those who used to sacrifice to them
5  and he burned the bones of priests on their altars
thus he cleansed judah and jerusalem
6  and in the cities of manasʹseh eʹphraim simʹeon and clear to naphʹtali in their surrounding ruins
7  he tore down the altars and he crushed the sacred poles and the graven images reducing them to powder and he cut down all the incense stands in all the land of israel after which he returned to jerusalem
8  in the 18th year of his reign when he had cleansed the land and the temple he sent shaʹphan the son of azaliʹah maaseiʹah the chief of the city and joʹah the son of joʹahaz the recorder to repair the house of jehovah his god
9  they came to hilkiʹah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought to the house of god which the levites serving as doorkeepers had collected from manasʹseh eʹphraim and all the rest of israel as well as from judah benjamin and the inhabitants of jerusalem
10  then they gave it to those who were appointed over the work in the house of jehovah
in turn the workers in the house of jehovah used it to mend and repair the house
11  they gave it to the craftsmen and the builders to buy hewn stones and timbers for braces and to build with beams the houses that the kings of judah had allowed to fall into ruin
12  and the men did the work faithfully
over them were appointed the levites jaʹhath and obadiʹah of the merarʹites and zechariʹah and meshulʹlam of the koʹhathites to serve as overseers
and the levites all of whom were skilled musicians
13  were in charge of the common laborers and were overseers of all those who were doing the work in every kind of service and some of the levites were secretaries officers and gatekeepers
14  while they were taking out the money that had been brought to the house of jehovah hilkiʹah the priest found the book of jehovahs law given through moses
15  so hilkiʹah said to shaʹphan the secretary i have found the book of the law in the house of jehovah
with that hilkiʹah gave the book to shaʹphan
16  then shaʹphan brought the book to the king and told him your servants are doing everything that was assigned to them
17  they have poured out the money that was found in the house of jehovah and they have handed it over to the appointed men and to those doing the work
18  shaʹphan the secretary also told the king there is a book that hilkiʹah the priest has given me
then shaʹphan began to read from it before the king
19  as soon as the king heard the words of the law he ripped his garments apart
20  then the king gave this order to hilkiʹah ahiʹkam the son of shaʹphan abʹdon the son of miʹcah shaʹphan the secretary and asaiʹah the kings servant
21  go inquire of jehovah in my behalf and in behalf of those who remain in israel and in judah concerning the words of the book that has been found for jehovahs rage that will be poured out against us is great because our forefathers did not carry out the word of jehovah by observing all that is written in this book
22  so hilkiʹah along with those sent by the king went to hulʹdah the prophetess
she was the wife of shalʹlum son of tikʹvah son of harʹhas the caretaker of the wardrobe and she was dwelling in the second quarter of jerusalem and they spoke to her there
23  she said to them this is what jehovah the god of israel says tell the man who sent you to me
24  this is what jehovah says i will bring calamity on this place and its inhabitants all the curses that are written in the book that they read before the king of judah
25  because they have abandoned me and are making sacrifices smoke to other gods in order to offend me with all the works of their hands my rage will pour out on this place and it will not be extinguished
26  but to the king of judah who sent you to inquire of jehovah this is what you should say to him this is what jehovah the god of israel says regarding the words that you have heard
27  because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before god on hearing his words concerning this place and its inhabitants and you humbled yourself before me and ripped your garments apart and wept before me i also have heard you declares jehovah
28  that is why i will gather you to your ancestors and you will be laid in your grave in peace and your eyes will not see all the calamity that i will bring on this place and its inhabitants
then they brought the reply to the king
29  so the king sent word and summoned all the elders of judah and jerusalem
30  after that the king went up to the house of jehovah with all the men of judah the inhabitants of jerusalem the priests the levitesall the people the great as well as the small
he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of jehovah
31  the king stood in his place and made a covenant before jehovah that he would follow jehovah and keep his commandments his reminders and his regulations with all his heart and with all his soul by carrying out the words of the covenant that were written in this book
32  furthermore he had all those who were in jerusalem and benjamin to agree to it
and the inhabitants of jerusalem acted according to the covenant of god the god of their forefathers
33  josiʹah then removed all the detestable things out of all the lands that belonged to the israelites and he made everyone in israel serve jehovah their god
throughout his lifetime they did not deviate from following jehovah the god of their forefathers
23  in the seventh year jehoiʹada acted courageously and made a pact with the chiefs of hundreds namely azariʹah the son of jeroʹham ishʹmael the son of jehohaʹnan azariʹah the son of oʹbed maaseiʹah the son of adaiʹah and elishaʹphat the son of zichʹri
2  then they went throughout judah and gathered together the levites from all the cities of judah and the heads of the paternal houses of israel
when they came to jerusalem
3  the entire congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of the true god after which he said to them look the kings son will reign just as jehovah promised concerning the sons of david
4  this is what you are to do one third of the priests and of the levites who will be on duty on the sabbath will be doorkeepers
5  another third will be at the house of the king and the other third will be at the gate of the foundation and all the people will be in the courtyards of the house of jehovah
6  do not let anyone enter the house of jehovah except the priests and the levites who are ministering
these may enter because they are a holy group and all the people will keep the obligation to jehovah
7  the levites must surround the king on every side each with his weapons in hand
anyone entering the house will be put to death
stay with the king wherever he goes
8  the levites and all judah did exactly what jehoiʹada the priest had commanded
so each one took his men who were on duty on the sabbath together with those who were off duty on the sabbath for jehoiʹada the priest had not dismissed the divisions from their duty
9  jehoiʹada the priest then gave the chiefs of hundreds the spears and the bucklers and the circular shields that had belonged to king david which were in the house of the true god
10  he then stationed all the people each with his weapon in hand from the right side of the house to the left side of the house by the altar and by the house all around the king
11  then they brought the kings son out and put on him the crown and the testimony and made him king and jehoiʹada and his sons anointed him
then they said long live the king
12  when athaliʹah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king she immediately came to the people at the house of jehovah
13  then she saw the king standing there by his pillar at the entrance
the princes and the trumpeters were with the king and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets and the singers with musical instruments were leading the praises
at this athaliʹah ripped her garments apart and cried out conspiracy conspiracy
14  but jehoiʹada the priest brought out the chiefs of hundreds those appointed over the army and said to them take her out from among the ranks and if anyone follows her put him to death with the sword for the priest had said do not put her to death in the house of jehovah
15  so they seized her and when she reached the entrance of the horse gate of the kings house they immediately put her to death there
16  then jehoiʹada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they would continue as the people of jehovah
17  after that all the people came to the house of baʹal and tore it down and they smashed his altars and his images and they killed matʹtan the priest of baʹal in front of the altars
18  then jehoiʹada put the oversight of the house of jehovah in the hands of the priests and the levites whom david had assigned in divisions over the house of jehovah to offer up the burnt sacrifices of jehovah according to what is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with song as directed by david
19  he also stationed the gatekeepers by the gates of the house of jehovah so that no one unclean in any respect could enter
20  he now took the chiefs of hundreds the nobles the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and escorted the king down from the house of jehovah
then they came through the upper gate to the kings house and seated the king on the throne of the kingdom
21  so all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet for they had put athaliʹah to death with the sword
22  then the inhabitants of jerusalem made his youngest son ahaziʹah king in his place for the marauder band that came with the arabs to the camp had killed all the older ones
so ahaziʹah the son of jehoʹram began to reign as king of judah
2  ahaziʹah was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in jerusalem
his mothers name was athaliʹah the granddaughter of omʹri
3  he too walked in the ways of the house of aʹhab for his mother became his adviser in acting wickedly
4  and he kept doing what was bad in jehovahs eyes like the house of aʹhab for they became his advisers after the death of his father to his destruction
5  he followed their advice and went with jehoʹram the son of king aʹhab of israel to wage war against king hazʹael of syria at raʹmothgilʹead where the archers wounded jehoʹram
6  he returned to jezʹreel to recover from the wounds that they had inflicted on him at raʹmah when he fought against king hazʹael of syria
ahaziʹah the son of jehoʹram the king of judah went down to jezʹreel to see jehoʹram the son of aʹhab because he had been wounded
7  but god brought about the downfall of ahaziʹah by his coming to jehoʹram and when he came he went out with jehoʹram to meet jeʹhu the grandson of nimʹshi whom jehovah had anointed to do away with the house of aʹhab
8  when jeʹhu began to execute judgment on the house of aʹhab he found the princes of judah and the sons of ahaziʹahs brothers ministers of ahaziʹah and he killed them
9  then he looked for ahaziʹah they captured him where he was hiding in samarʹia and they brought him to jeʹhu
then they put him to death and buried him for they said he is the grandson of jehoshʹaphat who searched for jehovah with all his heart
there was no one of the house of ahaziʹah who had the power to rule the kingdom
10  when athaliʹah ahaziʹahs mother saw that her son had died she rose up and destroyed the entire royal line of the house of judah
11  however jehoshabʹeath the daughter of the king took jehoʹash the son of ahaziʹah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were to be put to death and she put him and his nurse in an inner bedroom
jehoshabʹeath the daughter of king jehoʹram she was the wife of jehoiʹada the priest and a sister of ahaziʹah managed to keep him concealed from athaliʹah so that she did not put him to death
12  he remained with them for six years hidden at the house of the true god while athaliʹah was ruling over the land
32  after these things and these acts of faithfulness king sennachʹerib of assyrʹia came and invaded judah
he besieged the fortified cities intent on breaking through and capturing them
2  when hezekiʹah saw that sennachʹerib had come and intended to wage war against jerusalem
3  he decided after consulting with his princes and his warriors to stop up the waters of the springs outside the city and they gave him their support
4  many people were gathered together and they stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land saying why should the kings of assyrʹia come and find plenty of water
5  furthermore with determination he rebuilt the entire brokendown wall and raised towers on it and outside he made another wall
he also repaired the mound of the city of david and he made a large number of weapons and shields
6  he then appointed military chiefs over the people and assembled them at the public square of the city gate and encouraged them saying
7  be courageous and strong
do not be afraid or be terrified because of the king of assyrʹia and all the multitude with him for there are more with us than there are with him
8  with him is an arm of flesh but with us is jehovah our god to help us and to fight our battles
and the people were strengthened by the words of king hezekiʹah of judah
9  after this while king sennachʹerib of assyrʹia was at laʹchish with all his imperial might he sent his servants to jerusalem to king hezekiʹah of judah and to all the judeʹans in jerusalem saying
10  this is what king sennachʹerib of assyrʹia says in what are you trusting that you remain in jerusalem while it is besieged
11  is not hezekiʹah misleading you and handing you over to die by famine and thirst saying jehovah our god will rescue us from the hand of the king of assyrʹia
12  is this not the same hezekiʹah who removed your gods high places and his altars and then said to judah and jerusalem you should bow down before one altar and on it you should make your sacrifices smoke
13  do you not know what i and my forefathers did to all the peoples of the lands were the gods of the nations of the lands able to rescue their land from my hand
14  who among all the gods of these nations that my forefathers devoted to destruction was able to rescue his people from my hand so that your god should be able to rescue you from my hand
15  now do not let hezekiʹah deceive you or mislead you like this do not put faith in him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to rescue his people from my hand and from the hand of my forefathers
how much less then will your own god rescue you from my hand
16  his servants said even more against jehovah the true god and against hezekiʹah his servant
17  he also wrote letters to insult jehovah the god of israel and to speak against him saying like the gods of the nations of the lands who could not rescue their people from my hand so the god of hezekiʹah will not rescue his people from my hand
18  they kept calling loudly in the language of the jews to the people of jerusalem who were on the wall to make them afraid and to terrify them in order to capture the city
19  they spoke against the god of jerusalem the same way as against the gods of the peoples of the earth which are the work of mans hands
20  but king hezekiʹah and the prophet isaiah the son of aʹmoz kept praying about this and crying out to the heavens for help
21  then jehovah sent an angel and wiped out every mighty warrior leader and chief in the camp of the king of assyrʹia so that he went back to his own land in disgrace
he later entered the house of his god and there some of his own sons struck him down with the sword
22  so jehovah saved hezekiʹah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of king sennachʹerib of assyrʹia and from the hand of all others and gave them rest on every side
23  and many brought gifts to jehovah at jerusalem and choice things to king hezekiʹah of judah and he was greatly respected by all the nations after that
24  in those days hezekiʹah became sick and was at the point of death and he prayed to jehovah who answered him and gave him a sign
25  but hezekiʹah did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him for his heart became haughty bringing indignation against him and against judah and jerusalem
26  however hezekiʹah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart he and the inhabitants of jerusalem and jehovahs indignation did not come upon them in the days of hezekiʹah
27  and hezekiʹah came to have vast riches and glory and he made storehouses for himself for silver gold precious stones balsam oil shields and for all the desirable articles
28  he also made storage places for the produce of grain and new wine and oil as well as stalls for all the different kinds of livestock and stalls for the flocks
29  he also acquired cities for himself and an abundance of livestock flocks and herds for god gave him very many possessions
30  it was hezekiʹah who stopped up the upper source of the waters of giʹhon and directed them straight down to the west to the city of david and hezekiʹah was successful in every work of his
31  however when the spokesmen of the princes of babylon were sent to ask him about the sign that had occurred in the land the true god left him alone to put him to the test to get to know all that was in his heart
32  as for the rest of the history of hezekiʹah and his acts of loyal love they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of aʹmoz in the book of the kings of judah and of israel
33  then hezekiʹah was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the ascent to the burial places of the sons of david and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem honored him at his death
and his son manasʹseh became king in his place
6  at that time solʹomon said jehovah said he would reside in the thick gloom
2  now i have built a lofty house for you an established place for you to dwell in forever
3  then the king turned around and began to bless all the congregation of israel while all the congregation of israel stood
4  he said may jehovah the god of israel be praised the one who by his own mouth promised my father david and by his own hands has given fulfillment saying
5  from the day i brought my people out of the land of egypt i have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of israel in which to build a house for my name to remain there and i have not chosen a man to become leader over my people israel
6  but i have chosen jerusalem for my name to remain there and i have chosen david to be over my people israel
7  and it was the hearts desire of my father david to build a house for the name of jehovah the god of israel
8  but jehovah said to my father david it was your hearts desire to build a house for my name and you did well to desire this in your heart
9  however you will not build the house but your own son who is to be born to you is the one who will build the house for my name
10  jehovah has carried out the promise that he made for i have succeeded my father david and i sit on the throne of israel just as jehovah promised
i have also built the house for the name of jehovah the god of israel
11  and there i have placed the ark containing the covenant that jehovah made with the people of israel
12  then he stood before the altar of jehovah in front of all the congregation of israel and he spread out his hands
13  for solʹomon had made a platform of copper and put it in the middle of the court
it was five cubits long five cubits wide and three cubits high and he stood on it
and he knelt down in front of all the congregation of israel and spread his hands out to the heavens
14  and he said o jehovah the god of israel there is no god like you in the heavens or on the earth keeping the covenant and showing loyal love to your servants who are walking before you with all their heart
15  you have kept the promise that you made to your servant david my father
you made the promise with your own mouth and this day you have fulfilled it with your own hand
16  and now o jehovah the god of israel keep the promise you made to your servant david my father when you said there will never fail to be a man of your line before me to sit on the throne of israel if only your sons will pay attention to their way by walking in my law just as you have walked before me
17  and now o jehovah the god of israel let the promise that you made to your servant david prove trustworthy
18  but will god really dwell with mankind on the earth look the heavens yes the heaven of the heavens cannot contain you how much less then this house that i have built
19  now pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request for favor o jehovah my god and listen to the cry for help and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you
20  may your eyes be open toward this house day and night toward the place where you said that you would put your name to listen to the prayer that your servant prays toward this place
21  and listen to your servants pleas for help and to the pleas of your people israel when they pray toward this place and may you hear from your dwelling place from the heavens yes may you hear and forgive
22  if a man sins against his fellow man and is made to take an oath and is brought under liability to the oath and while under the oath he comes before your altar in this house
23  may you then hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants by paying back the wicked one and bringing what he did on his own head and by pronouncing the righteous one innocent and rewarding him according to his own righteousness
24  and if your people israel are defeated by an enemy because they kept sinning against you and they return and glorify your name and pray and beg for favor before you in this house
25  may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people israel and bring them back to the land that you gave to them and their forefathers
26  when the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they kept sinning against you and they pray toward this place and glorify your name and turn back from their sin because you humbled them
27  may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants of your people israel for you will instruct them about the good way in which they should walk and bring rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance
28  if a famine occurs in the land or a pestilence a scorching blight mildew swarming locusts or voracious locusts or if their enemies besiege them in any of the cities of the land or if any other sort of plague or disease occurs
29  whatever prayer whatever request for favor may be made by any man or by all your people israel for each one knows his own plague and his own pain when they spread out their hands toward this house
30  then may you hear from the heavens your dwelling place and may you forgive and reward each one according to all his ways for you know his heart you alone truly know the human heart
31  so that they may fear you by walking in your ways all the days they live on the land that you gave to our forefathers
32  also concerning the foreigner who is not part of your people israel and who comes from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm and he comes and prays toward this house
33  may you then listen from the heavens your dwelling place and do all that the foreigner asks of you so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you as your people israel do and may know that your name has been called on this house that i have built
34  if your people go to war against their enemies in the way that you send them and they pray to you in the direction of this city that you have chosen and toward the house that i have built for your name
35  then hear from the heavens their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them
36  if they sin against you for there is no man who does not sin and you are furious with them and you abandon them to an enemy and their captors carry them off captive to a land far or near
37  and they come to their senses in the land where they were carried off captive and they return to you and beg you for favor in the land where they are captives saying we have sinned and done wrong we have acted wickedly
38  and they return to you with all their heart and all their soul in the land of their captivity where they were carried off captive and they pray in the direction of their land that you gave to their forefathers and the city that you have chosen and the house that i have built for your name
39  then hear from the heavens your dwelling place their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them and forgive your people who have sinned against you
40  now o my god please may your eyes be opened and your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place
41  and now go up o jehovah god to your restingplace you and the ark of your strength
let your priests o jehovah god be clothed with salvation and let your loyal ones rejoice in your goodness
42  o jehovah god do not reject your anointed one
may you remember your loyal love to david your servant
31  as soon as they had finished all of this all the israelites who were present went out to the cities of judah and they smashed the sacred pillars cut down the sacred poles and tore down the high places and the altars throughout judah and benjamin as well as in eʹphraim and manasʹseh until they had destroyed them completely after which all the israelites returned to their cities each one to his own possession
2  then hezekiʹah appointed the priests in their divisions and the levites in their divisions each of the priests and levites for their service for the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices to minister and to give thanks and praise in the gates of the courtyards of jehovah
3  a portion of the kings own goods was given for the burnt offerings including the morning and evening offerings as well as the burnt offerings for the sabbaths the new moons and the festivals according to what is written in the law of jehovah
4  furthermore he commanded the people living in jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and the levites so that they might adhere strictly to the law of jehovah
5  as soon as the order was issued the israelites gave in great quantities the firstfruits of the grain new wine oil and honey and of all the produce of the field they brought in abundantly the tenth of everything
6  and the people of israel and of judah living in the cities of judah also brought in the tenth of cattle and sheep and the tenth of the holy things that were sanctified to jehovah their god
they brought it in and put it in many heaps
7  in the third month they began laying their contributions in heaps and in the seventh month they finished
8  when hezekiʹah and the princes came and saw the heaps they praised jehovah and blessed his people israel
9  hezekiʹah asked the priests and the levites about the heaps
10  and azariʹah the chief priest of the house of zaʹdok said to him from the time they started bringing the contributions into the house of jehovah the people have been eating to satisfaction and there is still an abundant surplus for jehovah has blessed his people and this great plenty is left over
11  at this hezekiʹah told them to prepare storerooms in the house of jehovah so they prepared them
12  they kept faithfully bringing in the contributions the tenth parts and the holy things conaniʹah the levite was put in charge of all of this as supervisor and his brother shimʹei was second
13  jehiʹel azaziʹah naʹhath asʹahel jerʹimoth joʹzabad eʹliel ismachiʹah maʹhath and benaiʹah were commissioners assisting conaniʹah and his brother shimʹei by the order of king hezekiʹah and azariʹah was supervisor of the house of the true god
14  and koʹre the son of imʹnah the levite gatekeeper on the east side was in charge of the voluntary offerings of the true god and he distributed the contribution made to jehovah and the most holy things
15  and under his direction were eʹden miniʹamin jeshʹua shemaiʹah amariʹah and shecaniʹah in the cities of the priests in their office of trust to distribute equally to their brothers in the divisions to great and small alike
16  this was in addition to the distribution made to the males from three years old and up who were listed in the genealogical enrollment who came daily to serve in the house of jehovah and to carry out the duties of their divisions
17  the genealogical enrollment of the priests was by their paternal house as was that of the levites who were 20 years old and up by the duties of their divisions
18  the genealogical enrollment included all their children their wives their sons and their daughters their entire congregationfor they kept themselves sanctified for what was holy because of their office of trust
19  as well as the descendants of aaron the priests who were living in the fields of the pastures surrounding their cities
in all the cities men had been designated by name to give portions to every male among the priests and to everyone included in the genealogical enrollment of the levites
20  hezekiʹah did this throughout judah and he continued to do what was good and right and faithful before jehovah his god
21  and every work that he undertook to search for his god whether in connection with the service of the house of the true god or in the law and the commandment he did wholeheartedly and he was successful
21  then jehoshʹaphat was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the city of david and his son jehoʹram became king in his place
2  his brothers jehoshʹaphats sons were azariʹah jehiʹel zechariʹah azariʹah miʹchael and shephatiʹah all of these were the sons of king jehoshʹaphat of israel
3  and their father had given them many gifts in silver and gold and valuable things along with fortified cities in judah but he gave the kingdom to jehoʹram for he was the firstborn
4  when jehoʹram had taken control of the kingdom of his father he strengthened his position by killing all his brothers with the sword as well as some of the princes of israel
5  jehoʹram was 32 years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in jerusalem
6  he walked in the way of the kings of israel just as those of the house of aʹhab had done for aʹhabs daughter had become his wife and he kept doing what was bad in jehovahs eyes
7  but jehovah did not want to bring the house of david to ruin for the sake of the covenant that he had made with david since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons always
8  in his days eʹdom revolted against judah and then set up its own king
9  so jehoʹram and his commanders crossed over with all his chariots and he rose up by night and defeated the eʹdomites who were surrounding him and the chariot commanders
10  but eʹdom has kept up its revolt against judah to this day
libʹnah also revolted against him at that time because he had abandoned jehovah the god of his forefathers
11  he had also made high places on the mountains of judah to cause the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution and he led judah astray
12  eventually a written message came to him from eliʹjah the prophet saying this is what jehovah the god of david your forefather says you have not walked in the ways of your father jehoshʹaphat or in the ways of king aʹsa of judah
13  but you walk in the way of the kings of israel and cause judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution like the prostitution of the house of aʹhab and you even killed your own brothers the household of your father who were better than you
14  therefore jehovah is dealing a great blow to your people to your sons to your wives and to all your possessions
15  and you will suffer with many sicknesses including a disease of your intestines until your intestines come out because of the disease day after day
16  then jehovah stirred up against jehoʹram the philisʹtines and the arabs who were near the ethioʹpians
17  so they invaded judah forcing their way in and carried off all the possessions that were found in the kings house as well as his sons and his wives and the only son left to him was jehoʹahaz his youngest son
18  and after all of this jehovah afflicted him with an incurable disease in his intestines
19  some time later when two full years had passed his intestines came out because of his disease and he died while suffering severely from his disease and his people did not make a burning for him like the burning that was made for his forefathers
20  he was 32 years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in jerusalem
no one regretted it when he died
so they buried him in the city of david but not in the burial places of the kings
25  amaziʹah was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 29 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was jehoadʹdan of jerusalem
2  he continued to do what was right in jehovahs eyes but not with a complete heart
3  as soon as he had the kingdom firmly in his control he killed his servants who had killed his father the king
4  but he did not put their sons to death for he acted in harmony with what is written in the law in the book of moses where jehovah commanded fathers should not die for their sons and sons should not die for their fathers but each one should die for his own sin
5  and amaziʹah gathered judah together and had them stand according to the paternal houses by the chiefs of thousands and by the chiefs of hundreds for all judah and benjamin
he registered them from 20 years old and up and he found them to be 300000 trained warriors to serve in the army able to handle the lance and the large shield
6  further he hired from israel 100000 mighty warriors for 100 silver talents
7  but a man of the true god came to him saying o king do not let the army of israel go with you for jehovah is not with israel not with any of the eʹphraimites
8  but go by yourself act and be courageous in battle
otherwise the true god could cause you to stumble before an enemy for god has the power to help and to cause stumbling
9  at this amaziʹah said to the man of the true god but what about the 100 talents that i have given to the troops of israel the man of the true god replied jehovah has the means to give you much more than that
10  so amaziʹah dismissed the troops that had come to him from eʹphraim sending them to their own place
however they were very angry with judah so they returned to their own place in the heat of anger
11  then amaziʹah took courage and led his own troops to the valley of salt and he struck down 10000 men of seʹir
12  and the men of judah captured 10000 alive
so they brought them to the top of the crag and threw them down from the top of the crag and they were all dashed to pieces
13  but the members of the troop whom amaziʹah had sent back from accompanying him to the war were making raids on the cities of judah from samarʹia clear to bethhoʹron they struck down 3000 of them and took much spoil
14  but after amaziʹah returned from striking down the eʹdomites he brought the gods of the men of seʹir and set them up for himself as gods and he began to bow down before them and to make sacrificial smoke to them
15  so jehovah grew very angry with amaziʹah and he sent a prophet who said to him why are you following the peoples gods that did not rescue their own people out of your hand
16  as he spoke to him the king said did we appoint you as an adviser to the king stop why should they strike you down then the prophet quit but he added i know that god has decided to bring you to ruin because you have done this and you have not listened to my advice
17  after consulting with his advisers king amaziʹah of judah sent a message to jehoʹash son of jehoʹahaz son of jeʹhu the king of israel saying come let us confront each other in battle
18  king jehoʹash of israel sent this message to king amaziʹah of judah the thorny weed in lebʹanon sent a message to the cedar in lebʹanon give your daughter to my son as a wife
however a wild beast of lebʹanon passed by and trampled down the thorny weed
19  you have said look i have struck down eʹdom
so your heart has become arrogant wanting to be glorified
but now stay in your own house
why should you provoke disaster and fall bringing judah down with you
20  but amaziʹah did not listen for this was from the true god to give them into the hand of the enemy because they had followed the gods of eʹdom
21  so king jehoʹash of israel went up and he and king amaziʹah of judah confronted each other in battle at bethsheʹmesh which belongs to judah
22  judah was defeated by israel so each one fled to his home
23  king jehoʹash of israel captured king amaziʹah of judah son of jehoʹash son of jehoʹahaz at bethsheʹmesh
then he brought him to jerusalem and made a breach in the wall of jerusalem from the gate of eʹphraim to the corner gate 400 cubits
24  he took all the gold and the silver and all the articles that were found in the house of the true god with oʹbedeʹdom and in the treasuries of the kings house as well as hostages
then he returned to samarʹia
25  amaziʹah the son of jehoʹash the king of judah lived for 15 years after the death of jehoʹash the son of jehoʹahaz the king of israel
26  as for the rest of the history of amaziʹah from beginning to end look is it not written in the book of the kings of judah and of israel
27  from the time that amaziʹah turned away from following jehovah they formed a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to laʹchish but they sent men after him to laʹchish and put him to death there
28  so they carried him back on horses and buried him with his forefathers in the city of judah
13  in the 18th year of king jeroboʹam abiʹjah became king over judah
2  he reigned for three years in jerusalem
his mothers name was micaiʹah the daughter of uriʹel of gibʹeah
and there was war between abiʹjah and jeroboʹam
3  so abiʹjah went to war with an army of 400000 mighty trained warriors
and jeroboʹam drew up in battle formation against him with 800000 trained men mighty warriors
4  abiʹjah now stood on mount zemaraʹim which is in the mountainous region of eʹphraim and said hear me o jeroboʹam and all israel
5  do you not know that jehovah the god of israel gave to david a kingdom over israel forever to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt
6  but jeroboʹam the son of neʹbat the servant of davids son solʹomon rose up and rebelled against his lord
7  and idle worthless men kept gathering to him
and they proved superior to rehoboʹam the son of solʹomon when rehoboʹam was young and fainthearted and he could not hold his own against them
8  and now you think you can hold your own against the kingdom of jehovah in the hand of the sons of david because you are a large crowd and you have the golden calves that jeroboʹam made as gods for you
9  have you not driven out jehovahs priests the descendants of aaron and the levites and have you not appointed your own priests just like the peoples of the other lands anyone who came along with a young bull and seven rams could become a priest of what are not gods
10  as for us jehovah is our god and we have not abandoned him our priests the descendants of aaron are ministering to jehovah and the levites assist in the work
11  they are making burnt offerings smoke to jehovah each morning and each evening along with perfumed incense and the layer bread is on the table of pure gold and they light up the golden lampstand and its lamps each evening because we are caring for our responsibility to jehovah our god but you have abandoned him
12  now look the true god is with us leading us with his priests and the signal trumpets for sounding the battle alarm against you
o men of israel do not fight against jehovah the god of your forefathers for you will not be successful
13  but jeroboʹam dispatched an ambush to come from behind them so that they were in front of judah and the ambush was behind them
14  when the men of judah turned around they saw that they had to fight the battle both in front and from behind
so they began to cry out to jehovah while the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets
15  the men of judah broke out in a war cry and when the men of judah shouted the war cry the true god defeated jeroboʹam and all israel before abiʹjah and judah
16  the israelites fled before judah and god gave them into their hand
17  abiʹjah and his people inflicted a great slaughter on them and the slain of israel kept falling 500000 trained men
18  thus the men of israel were humbled at that time but the men of judah proved superior because they relied on jehovah the god of their forefathers
19  abiʹjah kept chasing after jeroboʹam and captured cities from him bethʹel and its dependent towns jeshʹanah and its dependent towns and eʹphrain and its dependent towns
20  and jeroboʹam never regained his power during the time of abiʹjah then jehovah struck him down and he died
21  but abiʹjah grew in strength
in time he took 14 wives and he became father to 22 sons and 16 daughters
22  and the rest of abiʹjahs history his deeds and his words is recorded in the writings of the prophet idʹdo
14  then abiʹjah was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the city of david and his son aʹsa became king in his place
in his days the land had rest for ten years
2  aʹsa did what was good and right in the eyes of jehovah his god
3  he removed the foreign altars and the high places smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles
4  further he told judah to search for jehovah the god of their forefathers and to observe the law and the commandment
5  so he removed from all the cities of judah the high places and the incense stands and under him the kingdom continued without disturbance
6  he built fortified cities in judah since the land had no disturbance and there was no war against him during these years for jehovah gave him rest
7  he said to judah let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers gates and bars
for the land is still at our disposal because we have searched for jehovah our god
we have searched and he has given us rest all around
so their building was successful
8  aʹsa had an army of 300000 men from judah equipped with large shields and lances
and out of benjamin were 280000 mighty warriors who carried bucklers and were armed with bows
9  later zeʹrah the ethioʹpian came against them with an army of 1000000 men and 300 chariots
when he reached mareʹshah
10  aʹsa went out against him and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of zephʹathah at mareʹshah
11  aʹsa then called to jehovah his god and said o jehovah it does not matter to you whether those you help are many or have no power
help us o jehovah our god for we are relying on you and in your name we have come against this crowd
o jehovah you are our god
do not let mortal man prevail against you
12  so jehovah defeated the ethioʹpians before aʹsa and before judah and the ethioʹpians fled
13  aʹsa and the people with him pursued them as far as geʹrar and the ethioʹpians continued falling until not one of them was alive for they were crushed by jehovah and by his army
afterward they carried off a very great deal of spoil
14  further they struck all the cities around geʹrar for the dread of jehovah had come upon them and they plundered all the cities for there was much to plunder in them
15  they also attacked the tents of those with livestock and they captured a great number of flocks and camels after which they returned to jerusalem
29  hezekiʹah became king at the age of 25 and he reigned for 29 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was abiʹjah the daughter of zechariʹah
2  he kept doing what was right in jehovahs eyes just as david his forefather had done
3  in the first year of his reign in the first month he opened the doors of the house of jehovah and repaired them
4  then he brought the priests and the levites and assembled them in the square to the east
5  he said to them listen to me you levites
now sanctify yourselves and sanctify the house of jehovah the god of your forefathers and remove what is impure from the holy place
6  for our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was bad in the eyes of jehovah our god
they abandoned him and turned their faces away from the tabernacle of jehovah and turned their back on him
7  they also closed the doors of the porch and extinguished the lamps
they stopped burning incense and offering up burnt sacrifices in the holy place to the god of israel
8  therefore jehovahs indignation came against judah and jerusalem so that he made them an object of horror and astonishment and a cause for whistling as you can see with your own eyes
9  here our forefathers fell by the sword and our sons our daughters and our wives went into captivity for this
10  now it is my hearts desire to make a covenant with jehovah the god of israel so that his burning anger may turn away from us
11  my sons now is not the time to be negligent for jehovah has chosen you to stand before him to serve as his ministers and to make his sacrifices smoke
12  at that the levites rose up maʹhath the son of amaʹsai and joel the son of azariʹah of the koʹhathites from the merarʹites kish the son of abʹdi and azariʹah the son of jehalʹlelel from the gerʹshonites joʹah the son of zimʹmah and eʹden the son of joʹah
13  from the sons of elizaʹphan shimʹri and jeuʹel from the sons of aʹsaph zechariʹah and mattaniʹah
14  from the sons of heʹman jehiʹel and shimʹei from the sons of jeduʹthun shemaiʹah and uzʹziel
15  then they gathered their brothers together and sanctified themselves and came as the king had commanded by the words of jehovah to cleanse the house of jehovah
16  the priests then went inside the house of jehovah to do the cleansing and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of jehovah and took it to the courtyard of the house of jehovah
in turn the levites took it and carried it outside to the kidʹron valley
17  thus they began the sanctification on the first day of the first month and on the eighth day of the month they reached the porch of jehovah
they sanctified the house of jehovah for eight days and on the 16th day of the first month they finished
18  after that they went in to king hezekiʹah and said we have cleansed the whole house of jehovah the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and the table of the layer bread and all its utensils
19  and all the utensils that king aʹhaz cast aside during his reign when he acted unfaithfully we have made ready and sanctified and they are before the altar of jehovah
20  and king hezekiʹah got up early and gathered the princes of the city together and they went up to the house of jehovah
21  they brought seven bulls seven rams seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom for the sanctuary and for judah
so he told the priests the descendants of aaron to offer them up on the altar of jehovah
22  then they slaughtered the cattle and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar and they slaughtered the male lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar
23  then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the congregation and laid their hands on them
24  the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar to make atonement for all israel because the king said that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be for all israel
25  meanwhile he had the levites stationed at the house of jehovah with cymbals stringed instruments and harps by the commandment of david and of gad the kings visionary and of nathan the prophet for the commandment was from jehovah through his prophets
26  so the levites were standing with the instruments of david and the priests with the trumpets
27  then hezekiʹah ordered that the burnt sacrifice be offered on the altar
when the burnt offering started the song of jehovah started and also the trumpets following the direction of the instruments of king david of israel
28  and the whole congregation bowed down while the song was sung and the trumpets were soundingall this continued until the burnt offering was finished
29  and as soon as they finished making the offering the king and all those with him bowed low and prostrated themselves
30  king hezekiʹah and the princes now told the levites to praise jehovah with the words of david and of aʹsaph the visionary
so they offered praise with great rejoicing and they bowed down and prostrated themselves
31  then hezekiʹah said now that you have been set apart for jehovah come and bring sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings to the house of jehovah
so the congregation began to bring sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings and everyone with a willing heart brought burnt offerings
32  the number of burnt offerings that the congregation brought was 70 cattle 100 rams 200 male lambsall of these as a burnt offering to jehovah
33  and the holy offerings were 600 cattle and 3000 of the flock
34  but there were not enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings so their brothers the levites helped them out until the work was finished and until the priests could sanctify themselves for the levites were more conscientious about sanctifying themselves than the priests were
35  also there were many burnt offerings as well as the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings
thus the service of the house of jehovah was restored
36  so hezekiʹah and all the people rejoiced over what the true god had established for the people for this had all happened so suddenly
19  then king jehoshʹaphat of judah returned safely to his own house in jerusalem
2  jeʹhu the son of hanaʹni the visionary went out to meet him and said to king jehoshʹaphat is it the wicked you should be helping and is it those who hate jehovah you should love because of this the indignation of jehovah is against you
3  nevertheless there are good things that have been found in you because you cleared out the sacred poles from the land and you have prepared your heart to search for the true god
4  jehoshʹaphat continued living in jerusalem and he went out again among the people from beʹersheʹba to the mountainous region of eʹphraim to bring them back to jehovah the god of their forefathers
5  he also appointed judges throughout the land in all the fortified cities of judah city by city
6  and he said to the judges pay attention to what you are doing for you do not judge for man but for jehovah and he is with you when you pass judgment
7  now let the fear of jehovah be upon you
be careful about what you do for with jehovah our god there is no injustice no partiality no bribetaking
8  in jerusalem also jehoshʹaphat appointed some of the levites and the priests and some of the heads of the paternal houses of israel to serve as judges for jehovah and to settle legal cases for the inhabitants of jerusalem
9  and he commanded them this is what you should do in the fear of jehovah with faithfulness and a complete heart
10  whenever your brothers living in their cities bring a legal case that involves the shedding of blood or a question about a law a commandment regulations or judgments you should warn them so that they may not become guilty before jehovah otherwise his indignation will come against you and your brothers
this is what you should do so that you may not incur guilt
11  here is amariʹah the chief priest who is over you for every matter of jehovah
zebadiʹah the son of ishʹmael is the leader of the house of judah for every matter pertaining to the king
and the levites will serve as officers for you
be strong and act and let jehovah be with those who do what is good
24  jehoʹash was seven years old when he became king and he reigned for 40 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was zibʹiah from beʹersheʹba
2  jehoʹash continued doing what was right in jehovahs eyes all the days of jehoiʹada the priest
3  jehoiʹada chose two wives for him and he became father to sons and daughters
4  afterward it was the hearts desire of jehoʹash to renovate the house of jehovah
5  so he gathered the priests and the levites together and said to them go out to the cities of judah and collect money from all israel to repair the house of your god from year to year and you should act quickly in the matter
but the levites did not act quickly
6  so the king called jehoiʹada the chief and said to him why have you not required the levites to bring in from judah and jerusalem the sacred tax ordered by moses the servant of jehovah the sacred tax of the congregation of israel for the tent of the testimony
7  for the sons of athaliʹah that wicked woman had broken into the house of the true god and they had used all the holy things of the house of jehovah for the baʹals
8  then at the kings order a chest was made and placed outside at the gate of the house of jehovah
9  after that a proclamation was issued throughout judah and jerusalem to bring to jehovah the sacred tax that moses the servant of the true god had imposed on israel in the wilderness
10  all the princes and all the people rejoiced and they kept bringing contributions and dropping them into the chest until it was full
11  whenever the levites brought the chest in to be turned over to the king and they saw that there was a great deal of money in it the secretary of the king and the commissioner of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and then they would take it back to its place
that was what they did from day to day and they gathered money in abundance
12  then the king and jehoiʹada would give it to those supervising the work of the service of jehovahs house and they would hire the stonecutters and the craftsmen for renovating jehovahs house and also workers in iron and copper to repair jehovahs house
13  and those supervising the work got it started and the repair work progressed under their supervision and they restored the house of the true god to its proper condition and reinforced it
14  and as soon as they finished they brought the money that was left over to the king and jehoiʹada and they used it to make utensils for the house of jehovah utensils for the ministry and for making offerings and cups and utensils of gold and of silver
and they would offer up burnt sacrifices at the house of jehovah regularly all the days of jehoiʹada
15  when jehoiʹada was old and satisfied with years he died he was 130 years old at his death
16  so they buried him in the city of david along with the kings because he had done good in israel with respect to the true god and his house
17  after jehoiʹadas death the princes of judah came and bowed down to the king and the king listened to them
18  they abandoned the house of jehovah the god of their forefathers and began serving the sacred poles and the idols so that gods anger came against judah and jerusalem because of their guilt
19  he kept sending prophets among them to bring them back to jehovah and they kept warning them but they refused to listen
20  gods spirit came upon zechariʹah the son of jehoiʹada the priest and he stood above the people and said to them this is what the true god says why are you violating the commandments of jehovah you will not be successful because you have abandoned jehovah he will in turn abandon you
21  but they conspired against him and stoned him at the kings order in the courtyard of jehovahs house
22  thus king jehoʹash did not remember the loyal love that his father jehoiʹada had shown toward him and he killed his son who said as he was dying may jehovah see to it and call you to account
23  at the beginning of the year the syrian army came up against jehoʹash and they invaded judah and jerusalem
then they did away with all the princes of the people and they sent all their spoil to the king of damascus
24  for although the invading syrian army had a small number of men jehovah handed over to them a very large army because they had abandoned jehovah the god of their forefathers so they executed judgment on jehoʹash
25  and when they withdrew from him for they left him severely wounded his own servants conspired against him because he had shed the blood of the sons of jehoiʹada the priest
they killed him on his own bed
so he died and they buried him in the city of david but they did not bury him in the burial places of the kings
26  these were the conspirators against him zaʹbad the son of shimʹeath the amʹmonitess and jehozʹabad the son of shimʹrith the moʹabitess
27  regarding his sons and the many pronouncements against him and the renovation of the house of the true god all these things are recorded in the writings of the book of the kings
and his son amaziʹah became king in his place
5  so solʹomon completed all the work he had to do for the house of jehovah
solʹomon then brought in the things that david his father had made holy and he put the silver the gold and all the articles into the treasuries of the house of the true god
2  at that time solʹomon congregated the elders of israel all the heads of the tribes the chieftains of the paternal houses of israel
they came to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of jehovah from the city of david that is zion
3  all the men of israel assembled before the king at the festival that is held in the seventh month
4  so all the elders of israel came and the levites lifted up the ark
5  they brought up the ark the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils that were in the tent
the priests and the levites brought them up
6  king solʹomon and the entire assembly of israel who had been summoned to meet with him were before the ark
so many sheep and cattle were being sacrificed that they could not be counted or numbered
7  then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of jehovah to its place into the innermost room of the house the most holy underneath the wings of the cherubs
8  thus the wings of the cherubs were spread out over the place of the ark so that the cherubs covered over the ark and its poles from above
9  the poles were so long that the tips of the poles were visible from the holy in front of the innermost room but they were not visible from outside
and they are there to this day
10  there was nothing in the ark but the two tablets that moses placed in it at hoʹreb when jehovah made a covenant with the people of israel while they were coming out of egypt
11  when the priests came out from the holy place for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves regardless of their divisions
12  all the levite singers who belonged to aʹsaph to heʹman to jeduʹthun and to their sons and their brothers were clothed in fine fabric holding cymbals stringed instruments and harps they were standing east of the altar and along with them 120 priests were sounding the trumpets
13  at the moment when the trumpeters and the singers were praising and thanking jehovah in unison and as the sound ascended from the trumpets the cymbals and the other musical instruments as they were praising jehovah for he is good his loyal love endures forever then the house the house of jehovah was filled with a cloud
14  the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of jehovah filled the house of the true god
36  then the people of the land took josiʹahs son jehoʹahaz and made him king in jerusalem in place of his father
2  jehoʹahaz was 23 years old when he became king and he reigned for three months in jerusalem
3  however the king of egypt deposed him in jerusalem and fined the land 100 silver talents and a gold talent
4  furthermore the king of egypt made jehoʹahaz brother eliʹakim king over judah and jerusalem and changed his name to jehoiʹakim but neʹcho took his brother jehoʹahaz and brought him to egypt
5  jehoiʹakim was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years in jerusalem
he continued to do what was bad in the eyes of jehovah his god
6  king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon came up against him in order to bind him with two copper fetters to take him off to babylon
7  and nebuchadnezʹzar took some of the utensils of the house of jehovah to babylon and put them in his palace in babylon
8  as for the rest of the history of jehoiʹakim the detestable things that he did and what was found against him it is written in the book of the kings of israel and of judah and his son jehoiʹachin became king in his place
9  jehoiʹachin was 18 years old when he became king and he reigned for three months and ten days in jerusalem and he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes
10  at the start of the year king nebuchadnezʹzar sent to have him brought to babylon along with valuable articles of the house of jehovah
and he made his fathers brother zedekiʹah king over judah and jerusalem
11  zedekiʹah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years in jerusalem
12  he continued to do what was bad in the eyes of jehovah his god
he did not humble himself before the prophet jeremiah who spoke at the order of jehovah
13  he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezʹzar who had made him take an oath by god and he remained stubborn and hardhearted and refused to turn to jehovah the god of israel
14  all the chiefs of the priests as well as the people were exceedingly unfaithful practicing all the detestable things of the nations and they defiled the house of jehovah that he had sanctified in jerusalem
15  jehovah the god of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers warning them again and again because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place
16  but they kept ridiculing the messengers of the true god and they despised his words and mocked his prophets until the rage of jehovah came up against his people until they were beyond healing
17  so he brought against them the king of the chaldeʹans who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary he felt no compassion for young man or virgin old or infirm
god gave everything into his hand
18  all the utensils of the house of the true god great and small as well as the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the king and his princes everything he brought to babylon
19  he burned down the house of the true god tore down the wall of jerusalem burned all its fortified towers with fire and destroyed everything of value
20  he carried off captive to babylon those who escaped the sword and they became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of persia began to reign
21  to fulfill jehovahs word spoken by jeremiah until the land had paid off its sabbaths
all the days it lay desolate it kept sabbath to fulfill 70 years
22  in the first year of king cyrus of persia in order that jehovahs word spoken by jeremiah would be fulfilled jehovah stirred the spirit of king cyrus of persia to make a proclamation throughout his kingdom which he also put in writing saying
23  this is what king cyrus of persia says jehovah the god of the heavens has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has commissioned me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judah
whoever there is among you of all his people may jehovah his god be with him and let him go up
15  now the spirit of god came upon azariʹah the son of oʹded
2  so he went out to meet aʹsa and said to him hear me o aʹsa and all judah and benjamin jehovah is with you as long as you remain with him and if you search for him he will let himself be found by you but if you abandon him he will abandon you
3  for a long time israel had been without the true god without a priest teaching and without law
4  but when in their distress they returned to jehovah the god of israel and searched for him he let himself be found by them
5  in those times no one could travel safely for there was much unrest among all the inhabitants of the lands
6  nation was being crushed by nation and one city by another city because god kept them in disorder with every sort of distress
7  but you be strong and do not become discouraged for your activity will be rewarded
8  as soon as aʹsa heard these words and the prophecy of oʹded the prophet he took courage and removed the disgusting idols from all the land of judah and benjamin and from the cities that he had captured from the mountainous region of eʹphraim and he restored jehovahs altar that was before the porch of jehovah
9  and he gathered together all judah and benjamin and the foreign residents with them from eʹphraim and manasʹseh and simʹeon for they had deserted to him from israel in great number when they saw that jehovah his god was with him
10  so they were gathered together at jerusalem in the third month of the 15th year of aʹsas reign
11  on that day they sacrificed to jehovah from the spoil they had brought 700 cattle and 7000 sheep
12  furthermore they entered into a covenant to search for jehovah the god of their forefathers with all their heart and with all their soul
13  whoever would not search for jehovah the god of israel was to be put to death whether small or great man or woman
14  so they took an oath to jehovah with a loud voice with joyful shouting and with the trumpets and horns
15  and all judah rejoiced over the oath for they had taken the oath with all their heart and they eagerly sought him and he let himself be found by them and jehovah continued to give them rest on every side
16  aʹsa the king even removed maʹacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole
aʹsa cut down her obscene idol and pulverized it and burned it in the kidʹron valley
17  but the high places were not removed from israel
nevertheless aʹsas heart was complete all his life
18  and he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of the true godsilver gold and various utensils
19  there was no war until the 35th year of aʹsas reign
20  afterward the moʹabites and the amʹmonites together with some of the amʹmonim came to wage war against jehoshʹaphat
2  so jehoshʹaphat was told a large crowd has come against you from the region of the sea from eʹdom and there they are in hazʹazontaʹmar that is engedʹi
3  at that jehoshʹaphat became afraid and he resolved to search for jehovah
so he proclaimed a fast for all judah
4  the people of judah then gathered together to inquire of jehovah they came from all the cities of judah to consult jehovah
5  then jehoshʹaphat stood up in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of jehovah before the new courtyard
6  and he said o jehovah the god of our forefathers are you not god in the heavens do you not have dominion over all the kingdoms of the nations in your hand are power and might and no one can stand against you
7  o our god did you not drive away the inhabitants of this land from before your people israel and then give it as a lasting possession to the offspring of your friend abraham
8  and they settled in it and they built for you there a sanctuary for your name saying
9  if disaster should come on us whether by sword adverse judgment pestilence or famine let us stand before this house and before you for your name is in this house and call to you for help out of our distress and may you hear and save us
10  now here are the men of amʹmon moʹab and the mountainous region of seʹir whom you did not allow israel to invade when they came out of the land of egypt
they turned away from them and did not annihilate them
11  now they are repaying us by coming in to drive us out from your possession that you gave us as an inheritance
12  o our god will you not execute judgment on them for we are powerless before this large crowd that is coming against us and we do not know what we should do but our eyes are toward you
13  meanwhile all those of judah were standing before jehovah along with their little ones their wives and their children
14  then in the middle of the congregation the spirit of jehovah came upon jahaziʹel son of zechariʹah son of benaiʹah son of jeiʹel son of mattaniʹah the levite of the sons of aʹsaph
15  he said pay attention all judah and you inhabitants of jerusalem and king jehoshʹaphat here is what jehovah says to you do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd for the battle is not yours but gods
16  tomorrow go down against them
they will be coming up by the pass of ziz and you will find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of jeruʹel
17  you will not need to fight this battle
take your position stand still and see the salvation of jehovah in your behalf
o judah and jerusalem do not be afraid or be terrified
tomorrow go out against them and jehovah will be with you
18  at once jehoshʹaphat bowed low with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell down before jehovah to worship jehovah
19  then the levites who were descendants of the koʹhathites and the korʹahites rose up to praise jehovah the god of israel with a very loud voice
20  they rose up early the next morning and went out to the wilderness of tekoʹa
as they went out jehoshʹaphat stood up and said listen to me o judah and you inhabitants of jerusalem put faith in jehovah your god so that you may be able to stand firm
put faith in his prophets and you will be successful
21  after he consulted with the people he appointed men to sing to jehovah and to offer praise in holy adornment as they went out ahead of the armed men saying give thanks to jehovah for his loyal love endures forever
22  when they began joyfully singing praises jehovah set an ambush against the men of amʹmon moʹab and the mountainous region of seʹir who were invading judah and they struck each other down
23  and the amʹmonites and the moʹabites turned against the inhabitants of the mountainous region of seʹir to destroy and annihilate them and when they finished with the inhabitants of seʹir they helped to destroy one another
24  but when judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness and looked toward the crowd there they saw their carcasses fallen to the ground there were no survivors
25  so jehoshʹaphat and his people came to carry off the spoil from them and they found among them an abundance of goods clothing and desirable articles which they stripped off for themselves until they could carry no more
it took three days to carry off the spoil for it was abundant
26  on the fourth day they congregated together at the valley of berʹacah for there they praised jehovah
that is why they named that place valley of berʹacahuntil today
27  then all the men of judah and jerusalem with jehoshʹaphat at their head returned to jerusalem with rejoicing for jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies
28  so they came into jerusalem with stringed instruments harps and trumpets and went to the house of jehovah
29  and the dread of god came upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that jehovah had fought against the enemies of israel
30  thus the kingdom of jehoshʹaphat had no disturbance and his god continued to give him rest on every side
31  and jehoshʹaphat continued reigning over judah
he was 35 years old when he became king and he reigned for 25 years in jerusalem
his mothers name was azuʹbah the daughter of shilʹhi
32  he kept walking in the way of his father aʹsa
he did not deviate from it and he did what was right in jehovahs eyes
33  however the high places were not removed and the people had not yet prepared their heart for the god of their forefathers
34  as for the rest of the history of jehoshʹaphat from beginning to end there it is written among the words of jeʹhu the son of hanaʹni which were included in the book of the kings of israel
35  after this king jehoshʹaphat of judah made an alliance with king ahaziʹah of israel who acted wickedly
36  so he made him his partner in making ships to go to tarʹshish and they built the ships in eʹziongeʹber
37  however elieʹzer the son of dodavʹahu of mareʹsha spoke prophetically against jehoshʹaphat saying because you have made an alliance with ahaziʹah jehovah will destroy your works
so the ships were wrecked and they were unable to go to tarʹshish
1  solʹomon the son of david grew ever stronger in his kingship and jehovah his god was with him and made him exceedingly great
2  solʹomon sent for all israel the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds the judges and all the chieftains of all israel the heads of the paternal houses
3  then solʹomon and all the congregation went to the high place at gibʹeon for that was where the tent of meeting of the true god was which tent moses the servant of jehovah had made in the wilderness
4  however david had brought the ark of the true god up from kirʹiathjeʹarim to the place that david had prepared for it he had pitched a tent for it in jerusalem
5  and the copper altar that bezʹalel the son of uʹri the son of hur had made had been put before the tabernacle of jehovah and solʹomon and the congregation would pray before it
6  solʹomon now made offerings there before jehovah and he offered up 1000 burnt offerings on the copper altar of the tent of meeting
7  that night god appeared to solʹomon and said to him ask what you would like me to give you
8  at this solʹomon said to god you have shown great loyal love toward my father david and you have made me king in his place
9  now o jehovah god let your promise to david my father prove faithful for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust particles of the earth
10  give me now wisdom and knowledge to lead this people for who can possibly judge this great people of yours
11  then god said to solʹomon because this is your hearts desire and you have not asked for wealth riches and honor or for the death of those hating you nor have you asked for a long life but you have asked for wisdom and knowledge to judge my people over whom i have made you king
12  wisdom and knowledge will be given you but i will also give you wealth and riches and honor such as no kings before you have had and none after you will have
13  so solʹomon came from the high place at gibʹeon from before the tent of meeting to jerusalem and he reigned over israel
14  solʹomon kept accumulating chariots and horses he had 1400 chariots and 12000 horses and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in jerusalem
15  the king made the silver and the gold in jerusalem as plentiful as the stones and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the shepheʹlah
16  the horses of solʹomon had been imported from egypt and the company of the kings merchants would obtain the horses in droves for one price
17  each chariot imported from egypt cost 600 silver pieces and a horse cost 150 in turn they would export them to all the kings of the hitʹtites and the kings of syria
2  solʹomon now gave the order to build a house for jehovahs name and a house for his kingdom
2  solʹomon enlisted 70000 men as common laborers 80000 men as stonecutters in the mountains and 3600 as overseers over them
3  further solʹomon sent word to hiʹram the king of tyre do for me as you did for david my father when you sent him cedarwood to build a house to live in
4  now i am building a house for the name of jehovah my god to sanctify it to him to burn perfumed incense before him and also for the constant layer bread and the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths on the new moons and at the festival seasons of jehovah our god
this is a lasting obligation for israel
5  the house that i am building will be great for our god is greater than all the other gods
6  and who is up to the task of building him a house for the heavens and the heaven of the heavens cannot contain him so who am i that i should build him a house except as a place for making sacrifices smoke before him
7  now send me a craftsman who is skilled in working in gold silver copper iron purple wool crimson and blue thread and who knows how to cut engravings
he will work in judah and in jerusalem with my skilled craftsmen whom david my father has provided
8  and send me timbers of cedar juniper and algum from lebʹanon for i well know that your servants are experienced at cutting down the trees of lebʹanon
my servants will work along with your servants
9  to prepare for me great quantities of timber for the house that i am to build will be extraordinarily great
10  now look i will supply the food for your servants the woodcutters who cut down the trees 20000 cors of wheat 20000 cors of barley 20000 baths of wine and 20000 baths of oil
11  at that hiʹram the king of tyre sent this written message to solʹomon because jehovah loves his people he has made you their king
12  hiʹram then said may jehovah the god of israel be praised who made the heavens and the earth because he has given to king david a wise son endowed with discretion and understanding who will build a house for jehovah and a house for his kingdom
13  now i am sending a skilled craftsman endowed with understanding hiʹramaʹbi
14  who is the son of a danʹite woman but whose father was a man of tyre he has experience in working in gold silver copper iron stones timbers purple wool blue thread fine fabric and crimson
he can do every sort of engraving and make any design he is given
he will work with your own skilled craftsmen and the skilled craftsmen of my lord david your father
15  now let my lord send the wheat barley oil and wine he has promised to his servants
16  and we will cut down trees from lebʹanon as many as you need and we will bring them to you as rafts by sea to jopʹpa and you will take them up to jerusalem
17  solʹomon then took a count of all the men who were foreign residents in the land of israel after the census taken by david his father and there were found 153600
18  so he assigned 70000 of them as common laborers 80000 as stonecutters in the mountains and 3600 as overseers for putting the people to work
3  then solʹomon started to build the house of jehovah in jerusalem on mount moriʹah where jehovah had appeared to his father david in the place that david had prepared on the threshing floor of orʹnan the jebʹusite
2  he started to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign
3  and the foundation that solʹomon laid for building the house of the true god was 60 cubits long and 20 cubits wide according to the former measurement
4  the porch in front was 20 cubits long corresponding to the width of the house and its height was 120 and he overlaid it inside with pure gold
5  he paneled the great house with juniper wood after which he covered it with fine gold and then he decorated it with palmtree figures and chains
6  further he overlaid the house with beautiful precious stones and the gold he used was gold from parvaʹim
7  he covered the house the rafters the thresholds its walls and its doors with gold and he engraved cherubs on the walls
8  he now made the most holy compartment its length matched the width of the house 20 cubits and its width was 20 cubits
he covered it with 600 talents of fine gold
9  the weight of the gold for the nails was 50 shekels and he covered the roof chambers with gold
10  then he made in the most holy compartment two cherub sculptures and he overlaid them with gold
11  the overall length of the wings of the cherubs was 20 cubits one wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the house and its other wing was five cubits long and touched one of the other cherubs wings
12  and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits long and touched the other wall of the house and its other wing was five cubits long and touched one of the first cherubs wings
13  the wings of these cherubs were spread out 20 cubits and they stood on their feet and they faced inward
14  he also made the curtain of blue thread purple wool crimson and fine fabric and incorporated cherub designs into it
15  then he made two pillars at the front of the house 35 cubits in length and the capital on top of each pillar was five cubits
16  and he made chains like necklaces and put them on the tops of the pillars and he made 100 pomegranates and put them on the chains
17  he set up the pillars in front of the temple one to the right and one to the left he named the one on the right jaʹchin and the one on the left boʹaz
33  manasʹseh was 12 years old when he became king and he reigned for 55 years in jerusalem
2  he did what was bad in jehovahs eyes following the detestable practices of the nations that jehovah had driven out from before the people of israel
3  he rebuilt the high places that his father hezekiʹah had torn down he set up altars to the baʹals and made sacred poles and he bowed down to all the army of the heavens and served them
4  he also built altars in the house of jehovah about which jehovah had said in jerusalem my name will be forever
5  and he built altars to all the army of the heavens in two courtyards of the house of jehovah
6  and he made his own sons pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinʹnom he practiced magic used divination practiced sorcery and appointed spirit mediums and fortunetellers
he did on a grand scale what was bad in jehovahs eyes to offend him
7  he put the carved image that he made into the house of the true god about which god had said to david and to his son solʹomon in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel i will permanently put my name
8  and i will never again remove the feet of israel from the land that i assigned to their forefathers provided they carefully observe all that i have commanded them the entire law the regulations and the judicial decisions given through moses
9  manasʹseh kept leading judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem astray causing them to do worse than the nations that jehovah had annihilated from before the israelites
10  jehovah kept speaking to manasʹseh and his people but they paid no attention
11  so jehovah brought against them the army chiefs of the king of assyrʹia and they captured manasʹseh with hooks and bound him with two copper fetters and took him to babylon
12  in his distress he begged jehovah his god for favor and kept humbling himself greatly before the god of his forefathers
13  he kept praying to him and he was moved by his entreaty and heard his request for favor and he restored him to jerusalem to his kingship
then manasʹseh came to know that jehovah is the true god
14  after this he built an outer wall for the city of david west of giʹhon in the valley and as far as the fish gate and he continued it around to oʹphel and he made it very high
further he appointed army chiefs in all the fortified cities in judah
15  he then removed the foreign gods and the idol image from the house of jehovah and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of jehovah and in jerusalem and he had them thrown outside the city
16  he also prepared the altar of jehovah and began to offer up communion sacrifices and thanksgiving sacrifices on it and he told judah to serve jehovah the god of israel
17  nevertheless the people were still sacrificing on the high places although only to jehovah their god
18  as for the rest of the history of manasʹseh his prayer to his god and the words of the visionaries who spoke to him in the name of jehovah the god of israel they are recorded in the history of the kings of israel
19  also his prayer and how his entreaty was granted him all his sins and his unfaithfulness the locations where he built high places and set up the sacred poles and the graven images before he humbled himself they are written among the words of his visionaries
20  then manasʹseh was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him at his house and his son aʹmon became king in his place
21  aʹmon was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned for two years in jerusalem
22  and he continued to do what was bad in jehovahs eyes just as his father manasʹseh had done and aʹmon sacrificed to all the graven images that his father manasʹseh had made and he kept serving them
23  but he did not humble himself before jehovah as manasʹseh his father had humbled himself instead aʹmon greatly increased his guilt
24  eventually his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house
25  but the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against king aʹmon and they made his son josiʹah king in his place
12  soon after the kingship of rehoboʹam was firmly established and he had become strong he abandoned the law of jehovah and also all israel with him
2  in the fifth year of king rehoboʹam king shiʹshak of egypt came up against jerusalem for they had behaved unfaithfully toward jehovah
3  he had 1200 chariots 60000 horsemen and countless troops who came with him from egyptlibʹyans sukʹkiim and ethioʹpians
4  he captured the fortified cities of judah and finally reached jerusalem
5  shemaiʹah the prophet came to rehoboʹam and the princes of judah who had gathered at jerusalem because of shiʹshak and he said to them this is what jehovah says you have abandoned me so i have also abandoned you to the hand of shiʹshak
6  at that the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and said jehovah is righteous
7  when jehovah saw that they had humbled themselves the word of jehovah came to shemaiʹah saying they have humbled themselves
i will not destroy them and in a little while i will rescue them
i will not pour out my wrath on jerusalem through shiʹshak
8  but they will become his servants so that they will know the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands
9  so king shiʹshak of egypt came up against jerusalem
he took the treasures of the house of jehovah and the treasures of the kings house
he took everything including the gold shields that solʹomon had made
10  so king rehoboʹam made copper shields to replace them and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard who guarded the entrance of the kings house
11  whenever the king came to the house of jehovah the guards would come in and carry them and then they would return them to the guard chamber
12  because the king humbled himself jehovahs anger turned away from him and he did not destroy them completely
moreover there were some good things found in judah
13  king rehoboʹam strengthened his position in jerusalem and continued to reign rehoboʹam was 41 years old when he became king and he reigned for 17 years in jerusalem the city that jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of israel as the place to put his name
the name of the kings mother was naʹamah the amʹmonitess
14  but he did what was bad for he had not resolved in his heart to search for jehovah
15  as for rehoboʹams history from beginning to end is it not written among the words of shemaiʹah the prophet and of idʹdo the visionary in the genealogical record and there were constant wars between rehoboʹam and jeroboʹam
16  then rehoboʹam was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the city of david and his son abiʹjah became king in his place
