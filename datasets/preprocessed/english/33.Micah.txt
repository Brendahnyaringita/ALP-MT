4  in the final part of the daysthe mountain of the house of jehovahwill become firmly established above the top of the mountainsand it will be raised up above the hillsand to it peoples will stream
2  and many nations will go and say come let us go up to the mountain of jehovahand to the house of the god of jacob
he will instruct us about his waysand we will walk in his paths
for law will go out of zionand the word of jehovah out of jerusalem
3  he will render judgment among many peoplesand set matters straight respecting mighty nations far away
they will beat their swords into plowsharesand their spears into pruning shears
nation will not lift up sword against nationnor will they learn war anymore
4  they will sit each one under his vine and under his fig treeand no one will make them afraidfor the mouth of jehovah of armies has spoken
5  for all the peoples will walk each in the name of its godbut we will walk in the name of jehovah our god forever and ever
6  in that day declares jehovahi will gather the one who was limpingand collect together the dispersed onealong with those i treated harshly
7  i will make the one who was limping a remnantand the one far removed a mighty nationand jehovah will rule as king over them in mount zionfrom now on and forever
8  as for you o tower of the flockthe mound of the daughter of zionto you it will come yes the first dominion will comethe kingdom belonging to the daughter of jerusalem
9  now why are you shouting loudly have you no kingor has your adviser perishedso that pain has seized you like a woman giving birth
10  writhe and groan o daughter of zionlike a woman giving birthfor now you will go from the city and reside in the field
you will go as far as to babylonand there you will be rescuedthere jehovah will buy you back from the hand of your enemies
11  now many nations will be gathered against youthey will say let her be defiledand let our eyes see this happen to zion
12  but they do not know the thoughts of jehovahthey do not understand his purposefor he will gather them like a row of newly cut grain to the threshing floor
13  get up and thresh o daughter of zionfor i will change your horns into ironand i will change your hooves into copperand you will pulverize many peoples
you will devote their dishonest profit to jehovahand their resources to the true lord of the whole earth
7  woe to me i am like one whoafter the gathering of summer fruitand the gleaning following a grape harvestfinds no cluster of grapes to eatno early fig that i crave
2  the loyal one has perished from the earthamong men there is no one upright
all of them lie in ambush for bloodshed
each hunts his own brother with a dragnet
3  their hands are expert at doing what is badthe prince is making demandsthe judge asks for a rewardthe prominent one makes known his desiresand they work it out together
4  their best one is like thornstheir most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge
the day of your watchmen and of your reckoning will come
now they will panic
5  do not put faith in your companionor trust a close friend
guard what you say to the one who lies in your embrace
6  for a son despises his fathera daughter rises up against her motherand a daughterinlaw is against her motherinlawa mans enemies are the men of his household
7  but as for me i will keep on the lookout for jehovah
i will show a waiting attitude for the god of my salvation
my god will hear me
8  do not rejoice over me o my enemy
although i have fallen i will rise upalthough i dwell in the darkness jehovah will be my light
9  the wrath of jehovah i will bearfor i have sinned against himuntil he pleads my legal case and brings about justice for me
he will bring me out to the lighti will look upon his righteousness
10  my enemy will also seeand shame will cover her who said to me where is jehovah your god my eyes will look upon her
now she will be trampled like mud in the streets
11  it will be a day for building your stone wallson that day the boundary will be extended
12  on that day they will come to youall the way from assyrʹia and the cities of egyptfrom egypt all the way to the riverfrom sea to sea and from mountain to mountain
13  and the land will become desolate because of its inhabitantsas a result of what they have done
14  shepherd your people with your staff the flock of your inheritancethe one who was living alone in a forestin the midst of an orchard
let them feed on baʹshan and gilʹead as in the days of old
15  as in the days when you came out of the land of egypti will show him wonderful things
16  nations will see and be ashamed despite all their might
they will put their hand over their mouththeir ears will become deaf
17  they will lick the dust like serpentslike the reptiles of the earth they will come trembling out of their strongholds
to jehovah our god they will come in dreadand they will be in fear of you
18  who is a god like youpardoning error and passing over the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance he will not hold onto his anger foreverfor he delights in loyal love
19  he will again show us mercy he will conquer our errors
you will throw all their sins into the depths of the sea
20  you will show faithfulness to jacobloyal love to abrahamas you swore to our forefathers from the days of old
6  hear please what jehovah is saying
get up present a legal case before the mountainsand may the hills hear your voice
2  hear o mountains the legal case of jehovahyou firm foundations of the earthfor jehovah has a legal case with his peopleit is against israel that he will argue
3  my people what have i done to you how have i tired you out testify against me
4  for i brought you up out of the land of egyptfrom the house of slavery i redeemed youi sent before you moses aaron and mirʹiam
5  my people remember please what king baʹlak of moʹab proposedand what baʹlaam the son of beʹor answered himwhat took place from shitʹtim to gilʹgalso that you may know the righteous acts of jehovah
6  with what will i come before jehovah with what will i bow before god on high will i come before him with whole burnt offeringswith yearold calves
7  will jehovah be pleased with thousands of ramswith tens of thousands of torrents of oil will i give my firstborn son for my revoltthe fruit of my body for my sin
8  he has told you o man what is good
and what is jehovah requiring of you only to exercise justice to cherish loyaltyand to walk in modesty with your god
9  the voice of jehovah calls out to the citythose with practical wisdom will fear your name
pay attention to the rod and to the one who appointed it
10  are there still the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wickedand the incomplete eʹphah measure that is detestable
11  can i be morally clean with wicked scaleswith a bag of fraudulent stone weights
12  for her rich men are full of violenceand her inhabitants speak liestheir tongue is deceitful in their mouth
13  therefore i will wound you by striking youmaking you desolate because of your sins
14  you will eat but not be satisfiedyou will be empty inside
what you remove you will not carry off safelyand what you do carry off i will give to the sword
15  you will sow seed but you will not reap
you will tread olives but you will not use the oiland you will make new wine but you will drink no wine
16  for you observe the statutes of omʹri and all the work of the house of aʹhaband you walk in accord with their advice
that is why i will make you an object of horrorand her inhabitants something to be whistled atand you will bear the scorn of the peoples
5  now you are slashing yourselfo daughter under attacka siege is laid against us
with a rod they strike the judge of israel on the cheek
2  and you o bethʹlehem ephʹrathahthe one too little to be among the thousands of judahfrom you will come out for me the one to be ruler in israelwhose origin is from ancient times from the days of long ago
3  so he will give them upuntil the time that she who is to give birth has given birth
and the rest of his brothers will return to the people of israel
4  he will stand up and shepherd in the strength of jehovahin the superiority of the name of jehovah his god
and they will dwell in securityfor now his greatness will reach the ends of the earth
5  and he will bring peace
should the assyrʹian invade our land and tread on our fortified towerswe will raise up against him seven shepherds yes eight princes of mankind
6  they will shepherd the land of assyrʹia with the swordand the land of nimʹrod at its entrances
and he will rescue us from the assyrʹianwhen he invades our land and treads on our territory
7  the remaining ones of jacob will be in the midst of many peopleslike dew from jehovahlike showers of rain on vegetationthat do not put hope in manor wait for the sons of men
8  the remaining ones of jacob will be among the nationsin the midst of many peopleslike a lion among the beasts of a forestlike a young lion among flocks of sheepthat passes through and pounces and tears in piecesand there is no one to rescue them
9  your hand will be raised over your adversariesand all your enemies will be destroyed
10  in that day declares jehovahi will do away with your horses from your midst and destroy your chariots
11  i will destroy the cities of your landand tear down all your fortified places
12  i will put an end to the sorcery you practiceand no one practicing magic will remain among you
13  i will destroy your graven images and your pillars from your midstand you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands
14  i will uproot your sacred poles from your midstand annihilate your cities
15  in anger and wrath i will execute vengeanceon the nations that have not obeyed
1  the word of jehovah that came to miʹcah of moʹresheth in the days of joʹtham aʹhaz and hezekiʹah kings of judah and that he received in a vision concerning samarʹia and jerusalem
2  hear all you peoples pay attention o earth and what fills youand let the sovereign lord jehovah serve as a witness against youjehovah from his holy temple
3  for look jehovah is going out from his placehe will come down and tread on earths high places
4  the mountains will melt under himand the valleys will split apartlike wax before the firelike waters poured down a steep slope
5  all of this is because of the revolt of jacobbecause of the sins of the house of israel
what is the revolt of jacob is it not samarʹia and what are the high places of judah are they not jerusalem
6  i will make samarʹia a heap of ruins of the fielda place for planting vineyardsi will hurl her stones down into the valleyand i will lay bare her foundations
7  all her graven images will be crushed to piecesand all the gifts for which she hired herself out will be burned in the fire
i will devastate all her idols
for she collected them from the wages of prostitutionand they will again become the wages of prostitutes
8  because of this i will wail and howli will walk barefoot and naked
my wailing will be like that of jackalsand my mourning like that of ostriches
9  for her wound cannot be healedit has come as far as judah
the plague has spread to the gate of my people to jerusalem
10  do not announce it in gathyou must not weep at all
in bethaphʹrah roll in the dust
11  cross over in nakedness and shame o inhabitants of shaʹphir
the inhabitants of zaʹanan have not come out
there will be wailing in betheʹzel and it will take its support away from you
12  for the inhabitants of maʹroth have waited for goodbut what is bad has come down from jehovah to the gate of jerusalem
13  harness the chariot to the team of horses o inhabitants of laʹchish
you were the beginning of sin to the daughter of zionfor in you were found the revolts of israel
14  so you will give parting gifts to moʹreshethgath
the houses of achʹzib were something deceitful to the kings of israel
15  the conqueror i will yet bring in to you o inhabitants of mareʹshah
as far as adulʹlam the glory of israel will come
16  make yourselves bald and shear off your hair for your cherished children
make yourselves as bald as an eaglefor they have been taken away from you into exile
2  woe to those who scheme what is harmfulwho work out evil on their beds when morning light comes they carry it outbecause it is in the power of their hand
2  they desire fields and seize themalso houses and they take themthey defraud a man of his housea man of his inheritance
3  therefore this is what jehovah says here i am devising against this family a calamity from which you will not escape
you will no longer walk haughtily for it is a time of calamity
4  in that day people will recite a proverb concerning youand they will bitterly lament over you
they will say we are completely devastated he caused the portion of my people to change handshow he removes it from me to the unfaithful one he assigns our fields
5  so you will have no one to stretch the measuring cordto allot the land in the congregation of jehovah
6  stop preaching they preachthey should not preach these thingshumiliation will not overtake us
7  is it being said o house of jacob has the spirit of jehovah become impatient are these his deeds do not my own words bring good to those walking uprightly
8  but lately my own people have risen up as an enemy
you openly strip off the majestic ornament with the garmentfrom those passing by confidently like those returning from war
9  you drive the women of my people out from their delightful housesfrom their children you take away my splendor forever
10  get up and go for this is no place of rest
because of uncleanness there is destruction grievous destruction
11  if a man walks after wind and deception and tells this lie i will preach to you about wine and alcoholic drink then he would be just the preacher for this people
12  i will certainly gather all of you o jacobi will surely collect the remaining ones of israel together
in unity i will place them like sheep in the penlike a flock in its pastureit will be noisy with people
13  the one breaking out will go before themthey will break out and pass through the gate and go out by it
their king will pass through before themwith jehovah at their head
3  i said hear please you heads of jacoband you commanders of the house of israel
should you not know what is just
2  but you hate what is good and love what is badyou tear off the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones
3  you also eat the flesh of my peopleand strip off their skinsmashing their bones crushing them to pieceslike what is cooked in a pot like meat in a cooking pot
4  at that time they will call to jehovah for helpbut he will not answer them
he will hide his face from them at that timebecause of their wicked deeds
5  this is what jehovah says against the prophets who are leading my people astraywho proclaim peace while they bite with their teethbut who declare war against him who puts nothing into their mouths
6  you will have night there will be no visionthere will only be darkness for you no divination
the sun will set on the prophetsand the day will turn dark for them
7  the visionaries will be put to shameand the diviners will be disappointed
all of them will have to cover over the mustachefor there is no answer from god
8  as for me i am filled with power by the spirit of jehovahand with justice and mightto tell to jacob his revolt and to israel his sin
9  hear this please you heads of the house of jacoband you commanders of the house of israelwho detest justice and who make crooked all that is straight
10  who build zion with bloodshed and jerusalem with unrighteousness
11  her leaders judge for a bribeher priests instruct for a priceand her prophets practice divination for money
and yet they lean on jehovah saying is not jehovah with us no calamity will come upon us
12  so because of youzion will be plowed up as a fieldjerusalem will become heaps of ruinsand the mountain of the house will become like high places in a forest
