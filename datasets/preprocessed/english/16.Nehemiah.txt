28  the rest of the peoplethe priests the levites the gatekeepers the singers the temple servants and everyone who separated himself from the peoples of the lands to follow the law of the true god along with their wives their sons and their daughters all those with knowledge and understanding
29  joined their brothers their prominent men and bound themselves with a curse and an oath to walk in the law of the true god which had been given through moses the servant of the true god and to observe carefully all the commandments of jehovah our lord his judgments and his regulations
30  we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land and we will not take their daughters for our sons
31  if the peoples of the land bring in their wares and every kind of grain to sell on the sabbath day we will not buy anything from them on the sabbath or on a holy day
we will also forgo the produce of the seventh year and every outstanding debt
32  also we imposed the obligation on ourselves for each of us to give a third of a shekel yearly for the service of the house of our god
33  for the layer bread the regular grain offering the regular burnt offering of the sabbaths and the new moons and for the appointed feasts for the holy things for the sin offerings to make atonement for israel and for all the work of the house of our god
34  also we cast lots concerning the supply of the wood that the priests the levites and the people should bring to the house of our god by our paternal houses at the appointed times year by year to burn on the altar of jehovah our god according to what is written in the law
35  we will also bring the first ripe fruits of our land and the first ripe fruits of every sort of fruit tree year by year to the house of jehovah
36  as well as the firstborn of our sons and of our livestockaccording to what is written in the lawand the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks
we will bring them to the house of our god to the priests who minister at the house of our god
37  also the firstfruits of our coarse meal our contributions the fruitage of every sort of tree new wine and oil we should bring to the priests to the storerooms of the house of our god along with the tenth from our land to the levites for the levites are the ones who collect the tenths in all our agricultural cities
38  and the priest the son of aaron must be with the levites when the levites collect the tenth and the levites should offer up a tenth of the tenth to the house of our god to the rooms of the storehouse
39  for it is to the storerooms that the israelites and the sons of the levites should bring the contribution of the grain the new wine and the oil and that is where the utensils of the sanctuary are as well as the priests who minister the gatekeepers and the singers
we will not neglect the house of our god
4  now as soon as sanbalʹlat heard that we were rebuilding the wall he became angry and very upset and he kept mocking the jews
2  and in the presence of his brothers and the army of samarʹia he said what are the feeble jews doing will they do this by themselves will they offer sacrifices will they finish up in a day will they bring the charred stones to life out of the heaps of dusty rubble
3  now tobiʹah the amʹmonite who was standing beside him said if even a fox would climb up on what they are building it would knock down their stone wall
4  hear o our god for we are being treated with contempt and make their reproach return on their own heads and give them over as plunder in a land of captivity
5  and do not cover over their guilt or let their sin be erased from before you for they have insulted the builders
6  so we kept building the wall and the entire wall was joined together and rebuilt up to half its height and the people continued to put their heart into the work
7  now as soon as sanbalʹlat tobiʹah the arabians the amʹmonites and the ashʹdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being filled in they became very angry
8  they conspired together to come and fight against jerusalem and to create a disturbance in it
9  but we prayed to our god and kept a guard posted against them day and night
10  however people of judah were saying the strength of the laborers has failed and there is so much rubble we will never be able to build the wall
11  and our enemies kept saying before they know it or see us we will come right in among them and kill them and stop the work
12  whenever the jews living near them came in they told us again and again they will come at us from all directions
13  so i kept men posted at the lowest parts of the space behind the wall at the exposed places and i posted them by families with their swords their lances and their bows
14  when i saw their fear i immediately rose and said to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people do not be afraid of them
remember jehovah who is great and aweinspiring and fight for your brothers your sons and daughters your wives and homes
15  now after our enemies heard that what they were doing had become known to us and that the true god had frustrated their plan we all went back to work on the wall
16  from that day forward half of my men would do the work and half of them would hold the lances the shields the bows and the coats of mail
and the princes stood behind the whole house of judah
17  who were building the wall
those who were carrying the loads did the work with one hand while holding a weapon in the other hand
18  and each of the builders had a sword strapped to his hip while building and the one to blow the horn stood beside me
19  i then said to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people the work is large and extensive and we are spread out on the wall far apart from one another
20  when you hear the sound of the horn gather together to where we are
our god will fight for us
21  so we kept working while the other half were holding the lances from the break of dawn until the stars came out
22  at that time i said to the people let the men each along with his attendant spend the night inside jerusalem and they will guard us by night and work during the day
23  so neither i nor my brothers my attendants and the guards who followed me ever took off our garments and each of us kept his weapon in his right hand
11  now the princes of the people were living in jerusalem but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in jerusalem the holy city while the other nine stayed in the other cities
2  moreover the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in jerusalem
3  and these are the heads of the province who lived in jerusalem
the rest of israel the priests the levites the temple servants and the sons of the servants of solʹomon lived in the other cities of judah each one in his own possession in his city
4  also there lived in jerusalem some of the people of judah and of benjamin
of the people of judah were athaiʹah son of uzziʹah son of zechariʹah son of amariʹah son of shephatiʹah son of mahalʹalel of the sons of peʹrez

12  and their brothers who did the work of the house 822 and adaiʹah son of jeroʹham son of pelaliʹah son of amʹzi son of zechariʹah son of pashʹhur son of malchiʹjah
13  and his brothers heads of paternal houses 242 and amashʹsai son of azʹarel son of ahʹzai son of meshilʹlemoth son of imʹmer
14  and their brothers who were mighty courageous men 128 and their overseer was zabʹdiel a member of a prominent family
15  and of the levites shemaiʹah son of hasʹshub son of azriʹkam son of hashabiʹah son of bunʹni
16  and shabʹbethai and joʹzabad of the heads of the levites who were in charge of the outside business of the house of the true god
17  and mattaniʹah son of miʹcah son of zabʹdi son of aʹsaph the conductor of the singing who led the praises during prayer and bakbukiʹah the second of his brothers and abʹda son of shammuʹa son of gaʹlal son of jeduʹthun
18  all the levites in the holy city were 284
19  and the gatekeepers were akʹkub talʹmon and their brothers who kept guard in the gates 172
20  the rest of israel the priests and the levites were in all the other cities of judah each in his own inherited property
21  the temple servants were living in oʹphel and ziʹha and gishʹpa were in charge of the temple servants
22  the overseer of the levites in jerusalem was uzʹzi son of baʹni son of hashabiʹah son of mattaniʹah son of miʹca of the sons of aʹsaph the singers he was in charge of the work of the house of the true god
23  for there was a royal order in their behalf and there was a fixed provision for the singers as each day required
24  and pethahiʹah son of meshezʹabel of the sons of zeʹrah son of judah was the kings adviser for every matter of the people
25  regarding the settlements with their fields some of the people of judah lived in kirʹiatharʹba and its dependent towns in diʹbon and its dependent towns in jekabʹzeel and its settlements
26  in jeshʹua in molaʹdah in bethpelʹet
27  in haʹzarshuʹal in beʹersheʹba and its dependent towns
28  in zikʹlag in mecoʹnah and its dependent towns
29  in enrimʹmon in zoʹrah and in jarʹmuth
30  in zanoʹah in adulʹlam and their settlements in laʹchish and its fields and in azeʹkah and its dependent towns
they settled from beʹersheʹba clear to the valley of hinʹnom
31  and the people of benjamin were in geʹba michʹmash aiʹja bethʹel and its dependent towns
32  anʹathoth nob ananiʹah
33  haʹzor raʹmah gitʹtaim
34  haʹdid zeboʹim nebalʹlat
35  lod and oʹno the valley of the craftsmen
36  and some divisions of the levites from judah were assigned to benjamin
8  all the people then gathered with one accord at the public square in front of the water gate and they told ezʹra the copyist to bring the book of the law of moses which jehovah had commanded israel
2  so ezʹra the priest brought the law before the congregation of men women and all who could listen with understanding on the first day of the seventh month
3  and he read aloud from it before the public square in front of the water gate from daybreak until midday to the men the women and all who could understand and the people listened attentively to the book of the law
4  and ezʹra the copyist was standing on a wooden podium made for the occasion and standing alongside him on his right were mattithiʹah sheʹma anaiʹah uriʹah hilkiʹah and maaseiʹah and on his left were pedaiʹah mishʹael malchiʹjah haʹshum hashbadʹdanah zechariʹah and meshulʹlam
5  ezʹra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people
as he opened it all the people stood up
6  then ezʹra praised jehovah the true god the great one at which all the people answered amen amen and lifted up their hands
they then bowed low and prostrated themselves to jehovah with their faces to the ground
7  and jeshʹua baʹni sherebiʹah jaʹmin akʹkub shabʹbethai hodiʹah maaseiʹah keliʹta azariʹah joʹzabad haʹnan and pelaʹiah who were levites were explaining the law to the people while the people remained standing
8  and they continued reading aloud from the book from the law of the true god clearly explaining it and putting meaning into it so they helped the people to understand what was being read
9  and nehemiʹah who was then the governor ezʹra the priest and copyist and the levites who were instructing the people said to all the people this day is holy to jehovah your god
do not mourn or weep
for all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the law
10  he said to them go eat the choice things and drink what is sweet and send portions of food to those who have nothing prepared for this day is holy to our lord and do not feel sad for the joy of jehovah is your stronghold
11  and the levites were calming all the people saying be quiet for this day is holy and do not feel sad
12  so all the people went away to eat and to drink and to send out portions of food and to carry on a great rejoicing for they understood the words that had been made known to them
13  and on the second day the heads of the paternal houses of all the people the priests and the levites gathered around ezʹra the copyist to gain further insight into the words of the law
14  then they found written in the law that jehovah had commanded through moses that the israelites should dwell in booths during the festival in the seventh month
15  and that they should make proclamation and announce throughout all their cities and throughout jerusalem saying go out to the mountainous region and bring in leafy branches from olive trees pine trees myrtle and palm trees and the leafy branches of other trees to make booths according to what is written
16  so the people went out and brought them in to make booths for themselves each one on his roof as well as in their courtyards in the courtyards of the house of the true god in the public square of the water gate and in the public square of the gate of eʹphraim
17  thus all those of the congregation who had come back from the captivity made booths and were dwelling in the booths for the israelites had not done it this way from the days of joshua the son of nun until that day so that there was very great rejoicing
18  and day by day there was a reading from the book of the law of the true god from the first day until the last day
and they held the festival for seven days and there was a solemn assembly on the eighth day as was required
9  on the 24th day of this month the israelites assembled they were fasting with sackcloth and dust on themselves
2  those of israelite descent then separated themselves from all the foreigners and they stood and confessed their own sins and the errors of their fathers
3  then they stood up at their place and read aloud from the book of the law of jehovah their god for a fourth of the day and for another fourth of it they were confessing and bowing down to jehovah their god
4  jeshʹua baʹni kadʹmiel shebaniʹah bunʹni sherebiʹah baʹni and chenaʹni stood on the raised platform of the levites and they cried out with a loud voice to jehovah their god
5  and the levites jeshʹua kadʹmiel baʹni hashabneiʹah sherebiʹah hodiʹah shebaniʹah and pethahiʹah said stand up and praise jehovah your god throughout all eternity
and let them praise your glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praise
6  you alone are jehovah you made the heavens yes the heaven of the heavens and all their army the earth and all that is on it the seas and all that is in them
and you preserve all of them alive and the army of the heavens are bowing down to you
7  you are jehovah the true god who chose aʹbram and brought him out of ur of the chaldeʹans and gave him the name abraham
8  you found his heart faithful before you so you made a covenant with him to give him the land of the caʹnaanites the hitʹtites the amʹorites the perʹizzites the jebʹusites and the girʹgashites to give it to his offspring and you kept your promises because you are righteous
9  so you saw the affliction of our forefathers in egypt and you heard their outcry at the red sea
10  then you performed signs and miracles against pharʹaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land for you knew that they acted presumptuously against them
you made a name for yourself that remains to this day
11  and you split the sea before them so that they crossed through the sea on the dry land and you hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone thrown into the turbulent waters
12  you led them by day with a pillar of cloud and by night with a pillar of fire to light up for them the way they should go
13  and you came down on mount siʹnai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them righteous judgments laws of truth good regulations and commandments
14  you made known to them your holy sabbath and you gave them commandments regulations and a law through your servant moses
15  you gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry and you brought water out of the crag when they were thirsty and you told them to enter and take possession of the land that you had sworn to give to them
16  but they our forefathers acted presumptuously and became stubborn and they would not listen to your commandments
17  they refused to listen and they did not remember your extraordinary acts that you performed among them but they became stubborn and appointed a head to return to their slavery in egypt
but you are a god ready to forgive compassionate and merciful slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and you did not abandon them
18  even when they made for themselves a metal statue of a calf and were saying this is your god who led you up out of egypt and they committed great acts of disrespect
19  even then you in your great mercy did not abandon them in the wilderness
the pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way nor the pillar of fire by night to light up for them the way they should go
20  and you gave your good spirit to give them insight and you did not hold back your manna from their mouth and you gave them water when they were thirsty
21  for 40 years you provided them with food in the wilderness
they lacked nothing
their garments did not wear out and their feet did not become swollen
22  you gave them kingdoms and peoples apportioning them piece by piece so that they took possession of the land of siʹhon that is the land of the king of heshʹbon as well as the land of og the king of baʹshan
23  and you made their sons as numerous as the stars of the heavens
then you brought them into the land that you had promised their forefathers that they should enter and possess
24  so their sons went in and took possession of the land and you subdued before them the caʹnaanites who were the inhabitants of the land and you gave them into their hand both their kings and the peoples of the land to do with them as they pleased
25  and they captured fortified cities and a fertile land and they took possession of houses full of all sorts of good things cisterns already dug vineyards olive groves and fruit trees in abundance
so they ate and grew satisfied and fat and they basked in your great goodness
26  however they became disobedient and rebelled against you and turned their back on your law
they killed your prophets who warned them so as to bring them back to you and they committed acts of great disrespect
27  for this you gave them into the hand of their adversaries who kept causing them distress
but they would cry out to you in the time of their distress and you would hear from the heavens and because of your great mercy you would give them saviors to rescue them out of the hand of their adversaries
28  but as soon as they had relief they would again do what is bad before you and you would abandon them to the hand of their enemies who would dominate them
then they would return and call to you for help and you would hear from the heavens and rescue them time and again because of your great mercy
29  although you would warn them so as to bring them back to your law they behaved presumptuously and refused to listen to your commandments and they sinned against your regulations by which a man will live if he observes them
but they stubbornly turned their back and stiffened their neck and they refused to listen
30  you extended patience to them for many years and kept warning them by your spirit through your prophets but they refused to listen
finally you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands
31  and in your great mercy you did not exterminate them or abandon them for you are a compassionate and merciful god
32  and now o our god the god great mighty and aweinspiring who has kept his covenant and shown loyal love do not treat lightly all the hardship that has found us our kings our princes our priests our prophets our forefathers and all your people from the days of the kings of assyrʹia down to this day
33  you have been righteous in all that has come upon us for you have acted faithfully but we are the ones who have acted wickedly
34  as for our kings our princes our priests and our forefathers they have not observed your law nor paid attention to your commandments or to your reminders by which you warned them
35  even when they were in their kingdom and enjoying the abundant goodness that you gave them and they were in the broad and fertile land that you bestowed on them they did not serve you and did not turn away from their bad practices
36  so here we are today slavesyes slaves in the land that you gave to our forefathers to eat its fruitage and its good things
37  its abundant produce is for the kings whom you have put over us because of our sins
they rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they see fit and we are in great distress
38  so in view of all this we are making a binding agreement in writing and it is attested by the seal of our princes our levites and our priests
7  as soon as the wall had been rebuilt i set up the doors then the gatekeepers the singers and the levites were appointed
2  i then put my brother hanaʹni in charge of jerusalem along with hananiʹah the chief of the fortress for he was a most trustworthy man and feared the true god more than many others
3  so i said to them the gates of jerusalem should not be opened until the heat of the day and while they are standing guard they should shut the doors and bolt them
and assign the inhabitants of jerusalem as guards each to his assigned guardpost and each in front of his own house
4  now the city was spacious and large and there were few people inside it and the houses had not been rebuilt
5  but my god put it into my heart to gather together the nobles and the deputy rulers and the people to be enrolled genealogically
then i found the book of genealogical enrollment of those who first came up and i found written in it
6  and these were the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of the exiles those whom king nebuchadnezʹzar of babylon had exiled and who later returned to jerusalem and judah each to his own city

63  and of the priests the sons of habaiʹah the sons of hakʹkoz the sons of barzilʹlai who took a wife from the daughters of barzilʹlai the gilʹeadite and was called by their name
64  these looked for their records to establish their genealogy but they could not be found so they were disqualified from the priesthood
65  the governor told them that they should not eat from the most holy things until there was a priest who could consult the uʹrim and thumʹmim
66  the total number of the entire congregation was 42360

6  now as soon as sanbalʹlat tobiʹah geʹshem the arabian and the rest of our enemies were told that i had rebuilt the wall and that there were no gaps left in it although up to that time i had not set up the doors in the gates
2  sanbalʹlat and geʹshem immediately sent this message to me come and let us set a time to meet together in the villages of the valley plain of oʹno
but they were scheming to harm me
3  so i sent messengers to them saying i am engaged in a great work and i am not able to go down
why should the work stop while i leave it to come to you
4  they sent me the same message four times and i gave them the same reply each time
5  then sanbalʹlat sent his attendant to me with the same message a fifth time with an open letter in his hand
6  there it was written among the nations it has been heard and geʹshem is also saying it that you and the jews are scheming to rebel
that is why you are building the wall and according to these reports you are to become their king
7  also you have appointed prophets to proclaim about you throughout jerusalem there is a king in judah and now these things will be told to the king
so come and let us discuss this together
8  however i sent him this reply none of the things you are saying have taken place you are making them up out of your own imagination
9  for they were all trying to frighten us saying their hands will slacken in the work and it will not be done
now i pray strengthen my hands
10  then i went to the house of shemaiʹah the son of delaʹiah the son of mehetʹabel while he was confined there
he said let us set a time to meet at the house of the true god within the temple and let us close the doors of the temple for they are coming to kill you
they are coming to kill you by night
11  but i said should a man like me run away can a man like me go into the temple and live i will not go in
12  then i realized that god had not sent him but that tobiʹah and sanbalʹlat had hired him to speak this prophecy against me
13  he had been hired to frighten me and to cause me to sin so that they would have grounds to damage my reputation in order to reproach me
14  do remember o my god tobiʹah and sanbalʹlat and these deeds and also noadiʹah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were constantly trying to frighten me
15  so the wall was completed on the 25th day of eʹlul in 52 days
16  as soon as all our enemies heard of it and all the surrounding nations saw it they became greatly ashamed and they realized that it was with our gods help that this work had been done
17  in those days the nobles of judah were sending many letters to tobiʹah and tobiʹah would reply to them
18  many in judah swore allegiance to him for he was a soninlaw of shecaniʹah the son of aʹrah and his son jehohaʹnan had married the daughter of meshulʹlam the son of berechiʹah
19  also they would constantly tell me good things about him and then report to him what i said
then tobiʹah would send letters to frighten me
13  on that day the book of moses was read in the hearing of the people and it was found written that no amʹmonite or moʹabite should ever enter the congregation of the true god
2  for they had not met the israelites with bread and water but instead they had hired baʹlaam against them to curse them
however our god had changed the curse into a blessing
3  as soon as they heard the law they began to separate from israel all those of foreign descent
4  now before this the priest in charge of the storerooms of the house of our god was eliʹashib a relative of tobiʹah
5  he had made available for him a large storeroom where previously they used to put the grain offering the frankincense and the utensils and the tenth of the grain the new wine and the oil to which the levites the singers and the gatekeepers are entitled along with the contribution for the priests
6  and during all this time i was not in jerusalem for i went to the king in the 32nd year of king artaxerxʹes of babylon and sometime later i asked the king for a leave of absence
7  then i came to jerusalem and noticed the terrible thing that eliʹashib had done in behalf of tobiʹah making a storeroom available for him in the courtyard of the house of the true god
8  this was very displeasing to me so i threw all of tobiʹahs household furniture out of the storeroom
9  after that i gave orders and they cleansed the storerooms and i put back there the utensils of the house of the true god with the grain offering and the frankincense
10  i also found out that the portions of the levites had not been given them so that the levites and the singers who did the work had gone off each to his own field
11  so i reprimanded the deputy rulers and said why has the house of the true god been neglected then i gathered them together and assigned them back to their posts
12  and all judah brought in the tenth of the grain the new wine and the oil to the storerooms
13  then i put shelemiʹah the priest zaʹdok the copyist and pedaiʹah of the levites in charge of the storerooms and haʹnan the son of zacʹcur the son of mattaniʹah was their assistant for these men were considered reliable
it was their responsibility to make the distribution to their brothers
14  do remember me o my god concerning this and do not wipe out my acts of loyal love that i have done for the house of my god and its services
15  in those days i saw people in judah treading winepresses on the sabbath bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys and bringing wine grapes figs and every sort of load into jerusalem on the sabbath day
so i warned them against selling provisions on that day
16  and the tyrʹians who lived in the city were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise selling them to the people of judah and in jerusalem on the sabbath
17  so i reprimanded the nobles of judah and said to them what is this evil thing that you are doing even profaning the sabbath day
18  was not this what your forefathers did so that our god brought all this disaster on us and also on this city now you are adding to the burning anger against israel by profaning the sabbath
19  so as soon as the shadows began to fall on the gates of jerusalem before the sabbath i ordered that the doors be closed
i also said that they should not open them until after the sabbath and i stationed some of my own attendants at the gates so that no loads would be brought in on the sabbath day
20  so the traders and the sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside jerusalem once or twice
21  then i warned them and said to them why are you spending the night in front of the wall if you do it again i will use force against you
from that time on they did not come on the sabbath
22  and i told the levites that they should regularly purify themselves and come and guard the gates to keep the sabbath day holy
this also do remember to my credit o my god and show me pity according to your abundant loyal love
23  in those days i also saw jews who had married ashʹdodite amʹmonite and moʹabite women
24  half of their sons were speaking ashʹdodite and the language of the different peoples but none of them knew how to speak the language of the jews
25  so i reprimanded them and called down a curse on them and struck some of the men and pulled out their hair and made them swear by god you should not give your daughters to their sons and you should not accept any of their daughters for your sons or yourselves
26  was it not because of these that king solʹomon of israel sinned among the many nations there was no king like him and he was loved by his god so that god made him king over all israel
but the foreign wives caused even him to sin
27  is it not something unheard of for you to commit this great evil in acting unfaithfully against our god by marrying foreign women
28  one of the sons of joiʹada the son of eliʹashib the high priest had become a soninlaw of sanbalʹlat the horʹonite
so i drove him away from me
29  do remember them o my god because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the levites
30  and i purified them from every foreign defilement and i assigned duties to the priests and to the levites each to his own service
31  and arranged for the supply of the wood at appointed times and for the first ripe fruits
do remember me favorably o my god
5  however there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their jewish brothers
2  some were saying we are many with our sons and our daughters
we must get grain in order to eat and stay alive
3  others were saying we are giving our fields and our vineyards and our houses as security to get grain during the food shortage
4  still others were saying we have borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards for the kings tribute
5  now we are of the same flesh and blood as our brothers and our children are just like their children yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery and some of our daughters are already in slavery
but we are powerless to stop this because our fields and our vineyards belong to others
6  i became very angry when i heard their outcry and these words
7  so i considered these things in my heart and i took issue with the nobles and the deputy rulers and said to them each one of you is demanding interest from your own brother
further i arranged for a great assembly because of them
8  and i said to them to the extent possible we have bought back our own jewish brothers who were sold to the nations but will you now sell your own brothers and are they to be sold back to us at this they became speechless and they could find nothing to say
9  then i said what you are doing is not good
should you not walk in the fear of our god so that the nations our enemies cannot reproach us
10  moreover i my brothers and my attendants are lending them money and grain
let us please stop this lending on interest
11  please restore to them on this very day their fields their vineyards their olive groves and their houses as well as the hundredth of the money the grain the new wine and the oil that you are demanding as interest from them
12  to this they said we will restore these things to them and ask nothing back
we will do precisely as you say
so i called the priests and made those men swear to keep this promise
13  also i shook out the folds of my garment and said in this manner may the true god shake out from his house and from his possessions every man who does not carry out this promise and in this manner may he be shaken out and emptied
to this all the congregation said amen and they praised jehovah and the people did as they promised
14  moreover from the day that he commissioned me to become their governor in the land of judah from the 20th year to the 32nd year of king artaxerxʹes 12 years neither i nor my brothers ate the food allowance due the governor
15  but the former governors who were before me had burdened the people and had been taking from them 40 silver shekels for bread and wine each day
also their attendants had oppressed the people
but i did not do that because of the fear of god
16  furthermore i took a hand in the work on this wall and not a field did we acquire all my attendants were gathered there for the work
17  there were 150 jews and deputy rulers dining at my table as well as those who came to us from the nations
18  every day one bull six choice sheep and birds were prepared for me and once every ten days we had all sorts of wine in abundance
despite all this i did not demand the food allowance due the governor because the people were already bearing their burden of service
19  do remember me favorably o my god for all that i have done in behalf of this people
1  the words of nehemiʹah the son of hacaliʹah now in the month of chisʹlev in the 20th year i was in shuʹshan the citadel
2  at that time hanaʹni one of my brothers arrived with other men from judah and i asked them about the remaining jews who had escaped the captivity and also about jerusalem
3  they replied those remaining there in the province who have survived the captivity are in a terrible situation and in disgrace
the walls of jerusalem are broken down and its gates have been burned with fire
4  as soon as i heard these words i sat down and began to weep and mourn for days and i kept fasting and praying before the god of the heavens
5  i said o jehovah the god of the heavens the great and aweinspiring god who keeps his covenant and shows loyal love to those who love him and keep his commandments
6  please let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to listen to the prayer of your servant that i am praying to you today day and night concerning your servants the israelites all the while confessing the sins that the people of israel have committed against you
we have sinned both i and the house of my father
7  we have certainly acted corruptly against you by not keeping the commandments regulations and judicial decisions that you gave to your servant moses
8  remember please the word that you commanded your servant moses if you act unfaithfully i will scatter you among the peoples
9  but if you return to me and observe my commandments and obey them though your dispersed people should be at the end of the heavens i will gather them from there and bring them to the place that i have chosen to have my name reside
10  they are your servants and your people whom you redeemed by your great power and by your mighty hand
11  o jehovah please let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take delight in fearing your name and please grant success to your servant today and may this man show me compassion
now i was cupbearer to the king
2  in the month of niʹsan in the 20th year of king artaxerxʹes wine was set before him and as usual i took up the wine and gave it to the king
but i had never been gloomy in his presence
2  so the king said to me why do you look so gloomy when you are not sick this can be nothing but gloominess of heart
at this i became very frightened
3  then i said to the king long live the king why should i not look gloomy when the city the place where my forefathers are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been consumed by fire
4  the king then said to me what is it that you are seeking at once i prayed to the god of the heavens
5  i then said to the king if it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor with you send me to judah to the city where my forefathers are buried so that i may rebuild it
6  then the king with his royal consort sitting beside him said to me how long will your journey be and when will you return so it pleased the king to send me and i gave him a set time
7  then i said to the king if it pleases the king let letters be given me for the governors of the region beyond the river granting me safe passage until i reach judah
8  as well as a letter to aʹsaph the keeper of the royal park so that he may give me timber for beams for the gates of the fortress of the house and for the walls of the city and for the house where i will go
so the king gave them to me for the good hand of my god was upon me
9  eventually i came to the governors of the region beyond the river and gave them the kings letters
the king also sent with me army chiefs and horsemen
10  when sanbalʹlat the horʹonite and tobiʹah the amʹmonite official heard about it they were very displeased that someone had come to do something good for the people of israel
11  at length i came to jerusalem and i stayed there for three days
12  i rose up by night i and a few men with me and i did not tell anyone what my god had put into my heart to do for jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the one i was riding
13  and i went out at night through the valley gate passing in front of the fountain of the big snake to the gate of the ash heaps and i inspected the walls of jerusalem that were broken down and its gates that had been consumed by fire
14  and i passed along to the fountain gate and to the kings pool and there was not enough space for the animal i was riding to pass
15  but i continued up the valley by night and i kept inspecting the wall after which i came back and entered through the valley gate and then i returned
16  the deputy rulers did not know where i had gone and what i was doing for i had not yet said anything to the jews the priests the nobles the deputy rulers and the rest of the workers
17  finally i said to them you can see what a terrible situation we are in how jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned with fire
come let us rebuild the walls of jerusalem so that this disgrace will not continue
18  then i told them of how the good hand of my god was upon me and also of the words that the king had spoken to me
at this they said let us get up and build
so they strengthened themselves for the good work
19  now when sanbalʹlat the horʹonite tobiʹah the amʹmonite official and geʹshem the arabian heard of it they began to mock us and show us their contempt and say what are you doing are you rebelling against the king
20  however i replied the god of the heavens is the one who will grant us success and we his servants will get up and build but you have neither share nor claim nor memorial in jerusalem

27  at the inauguration of the walls of jerusalem they sought the levites and brought them to jerusalem from all the places they lived to celebrate the inauguration with rejoicing with songs of thanksgiving and with cymbals stringed instruments and harps
28  and the sons of the singers gathered together from the district from all around jerusalem from the settlements of the netophʹathites

30  and the priests and the levites purified themselves and they purified the people the gates and the wall
31  then i brought the princes of judah up on top of the wall
further i appointed two large thanksgiving choirs and processions and the one walked to the right on the wall toward the gate of the ash heaps

44  on that day men were appointed over the storehouses for the contributions the firstfruits and the tenths
into them they were to gather from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and the levites for there was rejoicing in judah because of the priests and the levites who were ministering
45  and they began taking care of the duties of their god and the obligation of the purification as did the singers and the gatekeepers according to the instructions of david and his son solʹomon
46  for long ago in the days of david and aʹsaph there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to god
47  and during the days of zerubʹbabel and during the days of nehemiʹah all israel gave portions to the singers and the gatekeepers according to the daily need
they also set aside the portion for the levites and the levites set aside the portion for the descendants of aaron
